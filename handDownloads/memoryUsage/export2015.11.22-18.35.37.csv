Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","4","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, and lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. A distributed intrusion detection approach based on timed automata is given. A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then the timed automata is constructed by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of dynamic source routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify the behaviour of every nodes by timed automata, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, the approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness. Finally, the intrusion detection method is evaluated through simulation experiments.","","","","10.1016/S1004-4132(08)60163-2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6072389","intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocol;security;timed automata","Automata;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols","","","","1","","","","","Aug. 2008","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we study Bloom-1, a data structure that performs membership check in one memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a standard Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g and Bloom-Q, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller or comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

The processing speed of one IDS cannot achieve the throughput requirement in the core networks because of the pattern matching, the key operation for signature-based IDS, is complex and time consuming. In this paper, it argues that if the signature set is shared by multiple IDSs, a packet needs to be checked once and once only by one of the IDSs, so traffic load can be redistributed among the IDSs to avoid local congestion. Packet marking is used to indicate the status of this packet utilized by collaborative IDSs, and a redistribution strategy named inner logical ring (ILR) is built among IDSs to redistribute the traffic load. Meanwhile, caching scheme is used to keep sequence for packets belonging to the same flow. This collaborative distributed IDS is robust with rapid response to various attacks, and the detection throughput is significantly increased from the throughput of the weakest IDS to the summation of all the collaborative IDSs.","","978-0-7695-3431-2","","10.1109/FGCN.2008.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4734082","attack detection;collaborative detection;pattern matching;signature-based;traffic load distribution","Computer science;Computer viruses;Computer worms;IP networks;International collaboration;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Internet;groupware;security of data","Internet users protection;caching scheme;collaborative distributed intrusion detection system;signature-based intrusion detection system;traffic load","","1","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the “big-dataism”. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.","","","","10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166057","","Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;XML","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data mining;public domain software;software engineering","Amazon EC2;Big-Dataism;Eclipse;Firefox;Novell;Open Office;RedHat;cloud based computation systems;cost analysis;data processing;denial of service attacks;open source bug tracking systems;polynomial time problem;software engineering;time analysis;very large open source repository mining","","0","","24","","","23-23 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2010.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528","Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing","Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server","Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing","ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols","","5","","34","","2010-06-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a distributed energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomalies in sensed data can be caused due to compromised or malfunctioning nodes. In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes. We also use weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve to periodically update the established normal profile. We demonstrate that the proposed distributed approach achieves comparable accuracy compared to a centralized approach, while the communication overhead in the network and energy consumption is significantly reduced.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678106","","Heating;Wireless sensor networks","fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;security of data;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;communication overhead;distributed principal component analysis;fault diagnosis;fixed-width clustering;intrusion detection;wireless sensor networks","","1","","16","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naïve Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918792","Classification;Data Pre-processing;Feature Selection;Malware Detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;feature selection;invasive software","FP rate;IDS;RA attribute;TP rate;UCI KDD CUP;Weka data mining;chi squared attribute;consistency subset;correlation feature selection;feature selection techniques;filtered attribute;filtered subset evaluation;gain ratio attribute;information gain attribute;intrusion detection system;machine learning tool;malware detection;network traffic dataset","","0","","21","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy. As a result of finding imperfect self-region radius we have faced weak detectors that couldn't recognize anomaly perfectly.

In a step for providing secured and reliable broadband services, formal specification logic along with a novel immune-inspired security framework (I2MANETs) have been introduced. The different immune components synchronized to the framework through an agent that has the ability to replicate, monitor, detect, classify, and block/isolate the corrupted packets and/or nodes in a federated domain.

The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence. That degradation must also be accurately measurable by a trusted and therefore external timing source. Accordingly, the benchmarking experiment that has been devised was performed using commodity hardware and freely available software, to determine which resources virtualization seems to degrade performance most significantly, and of these resources, which are most accurately timed externally. Although the results are preliminary, and strictly speaking, apply only to the actual hardware used in the experiment, they nonetheless show that there is potential to use passive network analysis to detect hardware based virtualization rootkits and associated malware.","","978-1-4673-1108-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280227","enhanced side-channel analysis;performance benchmarking;rootkit detection","Benchmark testing;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Timing;Virtual machine monitors","benchmark testing;invasive software;virtualisation","commodity hardware;freely available software;hardware virtualization;malware;performance benchmarking;performance degradation;rootkits;side-channel analysis method","","0","","21","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our structure, we aggregate alerts into graph structures and then we extract unknown attack scenarios with mining frequent structure patterns. This method is based on the observation that most alerts have frequent and sequential characteristic, since we can use frequent item set mining methods for extracting attack scenarios.

Building effective IDSs, unfortunately, has remained an elusive goal owing to the great technical challenges involved; and applied AI techniques are increasingly being utilized in attempts to overcome the difficulties. This paper presents a comparative study of using support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and linear genetic programs (LGPs) for intrusion detection. We investigate and compare the performance of IDSs based on the mentioned techniques, with respect to a well-known set of intrusion evaluation data gathered by Lincoln Labs. Through a variety of experiments and analysis, it is found that, with appropriately chosen population size, program size, crossover rate and mutation rate, LGPs outperform other techniques in terms of detection accuracy at the expense of time.

In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen. Even for legacy chkrootkit, the execution time with KVMonitor was 63% shorter than that in Xen.","","978-1-4799-6473-4","","10.1109/PRDC.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974789","IDS offloading;intrusion detection systems;security;virtual machine introspection;virtualization software","Kernel;Monitoring;Registers;Servers;Virtualization","security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","IDS offloading;KVM software;KVMonitor;Transcall;VM introspection;Xen software;intrusion detection system;legacy chkrootkit;memory introspection;virtual machines","","0","","39","","","18-21 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The benchmark scenarios are developed by sampling features of attacks, legitimate traffic and topologies from the real Internet. We have also developed a measure of DoS impact on network services to evaluate the severity of an attack and the effectiveness of a proposed defense. The benchmarks are integrated with the testbed via the experimenter's workbench - a collection of traffic generation tools, topology and defense library, experiment control scripts and a graphical user interface. Benchmark scenarios provide inputs to the workbench, bypassing the user's selection of topology and traffic settings, and leaving her only with the task of selecting a defense, its configuration and deployment points. Jointly, the benchmarks and the experimenter's workbench provide an easy, point-and-click environment for DoS experimentation and defense testing.","","978-1-4244-0739-2","978-1-4244-0739-2","10.1109/TRIDENTCOM.2007.4444680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444680","","Assembly;Benchmark testing;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Internet;Libraries;Network topology;Sampling methods;Security;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;graphical user interfaces;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;testing","DETER Testbed;Internet;comprehensive benchmark scenarios;defense library;denial-of-service attacks;graphical user interface;point-and-click environment;traffic generation tools","","4","","22","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deliberate and intended actions such as malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, are not only harmful and difficult to detect, but frequently these threats are propagated by an insider. Unfortunately, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information such as what is found in document control and management systems are limited in scope and capabilities. This paper presents an approach to detecting anomalies in business transactions and processes using a graph representation. In our graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) approach, anomalous instances of structural patterns are discovered in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. A definition of graph-based anomalies and a brief description of the GBAD algorithms are presented, followed by empirical results using a discrete-event simulation of real-world business transactions and processes.","","978-1-4244-2765-9","","10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4938645","","Communication system security;Companies;Computer science;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Pattern matching;Protection;Terrorism","authorisation;business data processing;data mining;graph theory;transaction processing","GBAD algorithm;business transaction process;data mining;graph-based anomaly detection;malicious exploitation;securing sensitive information;unauthorized access","","1","","18","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To render networks more secure, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) aim to recognize attacks within constraints of two major performance considerations: high detection and low false-alarm rates. It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems. IDSs are firmly entrenched on the security front but the exact role they can play and what their deployment entails must be clear to planners of security. Nine artificial neural networks (ANN) based IDS were implemented and tested with three experiments with three topologies. The results showed that: (i) in average the modular neural network (MNN) provided the best results in experiment #3; about 99.60%; (ii) in average multilayer perceptron (MLP) provided the best results in experiment #2; 74.71%; (iii) in experiment #1; the MNN provided the best results.","","978-1-4244-5106-7","978-9944-89-818-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355338","","Art;Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Multi-layer neural network;Network topology;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Testing","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Internet;artificial neural network;intrusion detection systems;modular neural network;multilayer perceptron","","1","","16","","","5-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Authorized but malicious transactions can make a database useless by impairing its integrity and availability. The paper presents the design of a real-time data attack isolation system, denoted DAIS. DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While obtaining high performance, it remains extremely flexible, with packet processing tasks implemented as simple modular elements that are composed to build fully functional routers and switches. Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion. We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier. In this configuration, Snap is able to forward 40 million packets per second, saturating four 10 Gbps NICs at packet sizes as small as 128 byes. This represents an increase in throughput of nearly 4x over the baseline Click running comparable elements on the CPU.","","978-1-4799-1640-5","","10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665173","","Graphics processing units;IP networks;Kernel;Parallel processing;Pipelines;Ports (Computers);Throughput","","","","4","","28","","","21-22 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion.

This paper presents a method to optimize the potential memory usage of DFA based algorithms for multi-pattern expression matching by the combining DFA's paths, named isomorphic path combination (IMPC). To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA. It means that CDFA may be a more proper model for multi-pattern matching than other FAs.","1095-2055","978-1-4577-0637-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005927","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Pattern matching;Registers","optimisation;pattern matching;telecommunication security","CDFA;DFA based algorithms;Snort pattern set;high speed network;isomorphic path combination;memory usage;multipattern expression matching;network security;optimization;packet inspection;pattern sets","","0","","21","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20100112","2009","","","1","10","The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification. The results affirm the FPGA as a natural packet processing technology that can be programmed in a high-level manner appropriate to a packe- t-oriented mindset.","","978-1-4244-4375-8","978-1-4244-4377-2","10.1109/FPT.2009.5377604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377604","","Best practices;Concurrent computing;Data communication;Digital communication;IP networks;Network-on-a-chip;Programming profession;Scalability;Technological innovation;Testing","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based packet processing components;Internet;data communication;digital revolution;field programmable technology;high-level packet-centric language;high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities;natural packet processing technology;packet-oriented mindset;software engineering","","4","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the propagation speed of worms, reactive defenses need to be automatic. It is important to understand where and how these defenses need to fit in the network so that they cannot be easily evaded. As there are several mechanisms malcode authors can use to bypass existing perimeter-centric defenses, this position paper argues that substantial defenses need to be embedded in the local area network, thus creating ""hard-LANs"" designed to detect and respond to worm infections. When compared with conventional network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), we believe that hard-LAN devices need to have two orders of magnitude better cost/performance, and at least two orders of magnitude better accuracy, resulting in substantial design challenges.","","0-7803-8686-8","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375206","","Communication system control;Computer aided software engineering;Computer worms;Costs;Humans;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Payloads;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;local area networks;telecommunication security","automatic reactive defenses;hard-LAN;local area network;malcode authors;network IDS;network intrusion detection systems;network worms;perimeter-centric defenses;propagation speed;self-propagating network programs","","6","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation of the Stellar system deployed on a large, operational enterprise network demonstrated its ability to scale to high alert volumes while accurately forming and prioritizing scenarios. Stellar not only produced high priority scenarios matching all incidents reported by human analysts, but also discovered additional scenarios of concern that had initially gone unnoticed. Furthermore, by following the simple formalism embedded in example SADL rules, system administrators quickly develop a correct understanding of the network they are protecting.","","0-7695-2317-X","","10.1109/IWIA.2005.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410706","","Aggregates;Buildings;Data security;Engines;Information security;Information systems;Laboratories;Protection;Risk management;Space technology","computer networks;real-time systems;risk management;security of data;sensor fusion;specification languages;system monitoring","Stellar;alert aggregation;alert correlation;fusion system;heterogeneous network defense systems;high traffic network;network protection;network risk assessment;operational enterprise network;real-time system;scenario building;scenario construction;security assessment declarative language;security risk assessment;security risk estimation;system administration","","3","","23","","","23-24 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores.

However, clear design guidelines and techniques for the support of scalable IMS-based deployment, especially for data-intensive services such as mobility management, presence, and instant messaging, are still missing. That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

In this paper, we examine the requirements from a range of distributed autonomous systems and then propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection architecture capable of online adaptation inspired by the vertebrate immune system.","","978-1-4244-2958-5","978-1-4244-2959-2","10.1109/CEC.2009.4983328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4983328","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Robot sensing systems;Wireless sensor networks","optimisation;security of data","anomaly detection;distributed autonomous systems;normal-model;swarm robotics;unsupervised anomaly detection architecture;vertebrate immune system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","38","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an alternative, we propose a scalable and efficient zero-configuration enterprise (SEIZE) networking architecture. SEIZE provides plug-and-play capability via globally unique flat addressing, while ensuring scalability and efficiency through shortest-path routing and hash-based location resolution.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493","Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation","","digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures","NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering","","7","","36","","2010-06-17","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

None of the existing wireless security protocols considers protection against them. We propose a novel scheme that detects and reduce DoS attacks in the WLANs. The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one. The scheme protects AS from DoS as hash calculations for detection of DoS are done once only. Scheme also prevents against legacy authentication/association and deauthentication/disassociation flooding DoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141379","802.11i;Denial of Service;WLAN Security;authentication","Authentication;Computer crime;Floods;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Microwave integrated circuits;Public key","access protocols;authorisation;client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;message passing;wireless LAN","DoS attack detection;DoS attack reduction;WLAN;access point;authentication server;client authentication requests;deauthentication;denial of service attacks;hash calculations;legacy association;legacy authentication;message forwarding;random number rate control mechanism;wireless LAN;wireless security protocols","","0","","29","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They perform a wide range of important network functions, including WAN optimizations, intrusion detection systems, network and application level firewalls, etc. Depending on the processing requirement of traffic, packet processing for different traffic flows may consume vastly different amounts of hardware resources (e.g., CPU and link bandwidth). Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice. We show, both analytically and experimentally, that our queueing scheme achieves nearly perfect Dominant Resource Fairness.","","","","10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733610","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Middleboxes;Radiation detectors;Round robin;Schedules;Time complexity","computational complexity;queueing theory;scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","WAN optimization;application level firewall;dominant resource fairness;elastic round robin;intrusion detection system;low complexity packet scheduler;multiple middlebox resources;multiresource fair queueing scheme;multiresource round robin;packet processing;time complexity;traffic flow","","2","","23","","","7-10 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions. The proposed time scheduling strategies are based on the optimal stopping theory, considering two minimization approaches for the consumption of transmission energy.

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the standard used for session signaling in VoIP. Crafty attackers can launch a number of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on a SIP based VoIP infrastructure that can severely compromise its reliability. In contrast, little work is done to analyze the robustness and reliability of SIP severs under DoS attacks. In this paper, we show that the robustness and reliability of generic SIP servers is inadequate than commonly perceived. We have done our study using a customized analysis tool that has the ability to synthesize and launch different types of attacks. We have integrated the tool in a real SIP test bed environment to measure the performance of SIP servers. Our measurements show that a standard SIP server can be easily overloaded by sending simple call requests. We define the performance metrics to measure the effects of flooding attacks on real time services - VoIP in SIP environment - and show the results on different SIP server implementations. Our results also provide insight into resources' usage by SIP servers under flooding attacks. Moreover, we show that how a well known open source SIP server can be crashed through 'INVITE of Death' - a malformed SIP packet maliciously crafted by our tool.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5426247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5426247","","Computer crime;Floods;Internet telephony;Measurement;Protection;Protocols;Robustness;Storage area networks;Testing;Web server","Internet telephony;multimedia communication;signalling protocols;telecommunication network reliability","DoS attacks;INVITE of Death;SIP-based VoIP systems;Voice over Internet Protocol;denial of service;malformed SIP packet;multimedia communication;reliability;session initiation protocol","","7","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present our work which concentrates on multi-pattern signature and propose a FPGA-based deep packet inspection engine for NIDS. The system can support both static and dynamic patterns. We employ Snort signature set and realize our system on NetFPGA platform.

In this paper, however, we investigate if it is feasible to aggregate Internet bad neighborhoods not only at /24, but to any network prefix. To do that, we propose two different aggregation strategies: fixed prefix and variable prefix. The motivation for doing that is to reduce the number of entries in the bad neighborhood list, thus reducing memory storage requirements for intrusion detection solutions. We also introduce two error measures that allow to quantify how much error was incurred by the aggregation process. An evaluation of both strategies was conducted by analyzing real world data in our aggregation prototype.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211917","","Aggregates;IP networks;Internet;Measurement;Merging;Security;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;computer network security;unsolicited e-mail","/24 subnetwork;Internet bad neighborhood aggregation;aggregation prototype;aggregation strategies;innovative approach;intrusion detection solutions;memory storage requirements;network prefix;spam fighting","","5","","20","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These proposed machine learning based IDSs come in addition to the already deployed signatures which are already in use in conventional intrusion detection systems like Snort-Wireless and Kismet. In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too. On the other hand, even though Snort-Wireless is an infrastructure independent detector, it cannot adapt to unknown attacks even if they are similar to others for which it has signatures on.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529352","Denial of Service;Genetic Programming;Intrusion Detection System;Wireless Networks","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;Detectors;Floods;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;wireless LAN","GP based IDS;Kismet;Snort-Wireless;WiFi networks;data link layer;genetic programming;intrusion detection system;machine learning;wireless networks","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As with any distributed storage system, a major design challenge for a Storage Area Network (SAN) is to provide data integrity and confidentiality. In this paper we propose a solution which addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key distribution to allow scalable data sharing. Our scheme uses strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities (e.g., switches, routers or other network elements), thereby removing bottlenecks at the disks and causing minimal inconvenience to the hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose efficient group key mechanisms that do not involve any centralized key distribution servers. This allows our scheme to be scalable and be free from any single point of failure or attack.","","0-7695-1888-5","","10.1109/SISW.2002.1183514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183514","","Availability;Cities and towns;Cryptography;Data security;Network servers;Power system security;Scalability;Secure storage;Storage area networks;Web server","cryptography;data integrity;data privacy;distributed databases;network operating systems","SAN entities;cryptographic processing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;distributed storage system;group key agreement;group key mechanisms;reliability;scalability;scalable data sharing;storage area networks;strong cryptographic techniques","","3","1","30","","","11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their security problems are ignored despite their importance and popularity. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth security analysis on GPUs to detect security vulnerabilities. We observe that contemporary, widely-used GPUs, both NVIDIA's and AMD's, do not initialize newly allocated GPU memory pages which may contain sensitive user data. By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures. The accuracy of our advanced inference attack that uses both pixel sequence matching and RGB histogram matching is up to 95.4%.","1081-6011","","","10.1109/SP.2014.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956554","","Browsers;Chromium;Context;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Memory management;Security","graphics processing units;image matching;image texture;rendering (computer graphics)","AMD GPU;GPU memory pages;GPU vulnerability;NVIDIA GPU;RGB histogram matching;Web page;graphics processing unit;pixel sequence matching;red-green-blue histogram matching;rendering","","0","","39","","","18-21 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
