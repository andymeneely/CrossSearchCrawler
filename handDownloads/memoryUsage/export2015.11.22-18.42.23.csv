The growing network rates, rapidly approaching 10 Gbits/sec, and the large number of signatures that need to be scanned concurrently pose very demanding challenges to algorithmic design and practical implementation. In this paper we present SCAMPI, a ground-breaking string searching algorithm that is fast, space-efficient, scalable and resilient to attacks. SCAMPI is designed with a memory-centric model of complexity in mind, to minimize memory traffic and enhance data reuse with a careful compile-time data layout. The experimental evaluation executed on two families of multicore processors, Cell B.E and Intel Xeon E5472, shows that it is possible to obtain a processing rate of more than 2 Gbits/sec per core with very large dictionaries and heavy hitting rates. In the largest tested configuration, SCAMPI reaches 16 Gbits/sec on 8 Xeon cores, reaching, and in some cases exceeding, the performance of special-purpose processors and FPGA. Using SCAMPI we have been able to scan an input stream using a dictionary of 3.5 millions keywords, more than an order of magnitude larger than any published result in the literature and in commercial prototypes, at a rate of more than 1.2 Gbits/sec per processing core.","","","","10.1145/1654059.1654106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375524","","","multiprocessing systems;program compilers;security of data;string matching","Cell BE;Intel Xeon E5472;SCAMPI;Xeon core;algorithmic design;compile-time data layout;data reuse;dictionary;ground-breaking string searching algorithm;hitting rate;memory traffic;memory-centric model;multicore processor;network intrusion detection system;network rate;pattern inspection;processing rate;scalable CAM-based algorithm;string matching","","1","","23","","","14-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key component of the GPS is the security information management (SIM) module where data mining technology is employed to analyze the events (alerts) collected from the LPSs. Once a DDoS attack is recognized by the SIM module, the GPS informs the LPS (IDS/IPS) to adjust the thresholds immediately to block the attack from the sources.

Similar to other Internet-based technologies, Cloud Computing poses security risks. This paper aims to formulate the implications of Cloud Computing risks on personal health information. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse literature on Cloud Computing risks to emphasise its implications from a personal health information perspective. Access management, security issues, legal issues and loss of data are some of the risks that negatively impact the storing of PHRs in the Cloud. These can be mitigated by ensuring that only authorized parties are granted access; ensuring that users do not gain access to other users' data and that data remains encrypted; Cloud providers should comply to audits in order to make sure that proper regulations are followed in securing data in the Cloud; and making backups in case of data loss. Using Cloud-based PHRs can improve healthcare. Cloud Providers should work together with PHR providers in order to make sure PHR users can reap these benefits without being too concerned about the associated risks.","","","","10.1109/i-Society.2014.7009039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009039","Cloud Computing;information security risks;legislation;personal health records;privacy","Availability;Cloud computing;Information security;Medical services;Organizations","cloud computing;electronic health records;health care;security of data","PHR;cloud-based personal health records;health care;information security risk measure;qualitative content analysis","","0","","40","","","10-12 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is based on a self-organizing and rapidly deployed network of mobile services that collaborate without using any preexisting fixed network infrastructure. Survivability is defined as the capability of a service to fulfill its mission in a timely manner, even in the presence of attacks, threats, or failures. Any failure of a single system may affect a business process; however, the monitoring of many mobile services simultaneously is not an easy task. This paper bridges the analyses of business processes and security threats with an alert mechanism.

A major bottleneck that IPSs face is that they scan incoming packets one byte at a time, which limits their throughput and latency. In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later.

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.","","978-1-4673-5832-3","","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516336","Anomaly Detection;Change Detection;Network Intrusion;Outlier Detection;Performance Evaluation;Threshold Algorithms","","data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;SVM;change detection algorithm;change point outlier detection method;classification error;data analysis;data collection;data exchange;data mining;distributed solution procedure;false alarm rate minimization;frequently changing trend identification;information exchange;intelligence building;intelligent subsystem;intrusion detection analysis;learning;network data;network security;real time intrusion detection system;registration error;support vector machine;system security;timely detection","","0","","18","","","26-28 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.","","","","10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243","Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation.

Due to significant requirement diversities in both lookup load and storage load between PF and CF, the integrated solution exploits the complementary characteristics of the two tasks and well balances both the lookup load and storage load among TCAMs. A prefix filtering based CF algorithm is designed to reduce the lookup load and a novel cache mechanism is developed to dynamically handle the lookups from overloaded TCAMs. Simulations based on real-world traffic traces show that the proposed solution can match 10Gbps line rate for executing both PF and CF with the similar costs as CF task only.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501980","","Algorithm design and analysis;Associative memory;Coprocessors;Costs;Filtering algorithms;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Memory architecture;Traffic control","","","","0","","23","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets.

This paper focuses on security and privacy concerns at different levels of the composition and presents system level solutions for ensuring the security and trust of modern cyber-physical systems.","","","","10.1109/ETS.2015.7138763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7138763","","Computer crime;Guidelines;Medical services;Smart grids;Smart homes","data privacy;security of data","CPS;communications;computational elements;control systems;cyber-physical system;integration elements;nation-wide power grids;privacy leakage;security measure;security violations;smart home;trust measure;ubiquitous health care systems","","0","","87","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the design of a new AIS algorithm and classifier system called simple AIS is described. It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier. This approach ensures global optimization of the whole system, and in addition, no population control mechanism is needed.

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity. In this article we point out key challenges that are impeding the rapid progress of this upcoming technology. We systematically examine each layer of the network and discuss the feasibility of some state-of-the-art technologies/protocols for adequately addressing these challenges. We also provide broader and deeper insight to many other issues that are of paramount importance for the successful deployment and wider acceptance of WMNs.","1536-1284","","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4300987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300987","","Airports;Costs;Educational institutions;IP networks;Spine;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks","Internet;radio access networks;wireless LAN","Internet service provisioning;Web-in-the-sky;Wi-Fi hotspots;backhaul network access;broadband wireless Internet connectivity;extensive cabling;multihop wireless communication;network layer;network service provider;wireless mesh network","","65","1","32","","","August 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. AODV, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980","978-1-4244-4214-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to make these classifiers workable online. The idea is that different applications will show distinct traffic patterns from the very beginning of the flow, and so using statistics extracted from the first few packets can distinguish applications. Preliminary result shows that our method can achieve high flow accuracy, just a bit lower than using full-flow statistics. Using fewer packets per flow is promising, since it not only enables early classification and can easily apply to most of the existing classifiers, but also saves memory and computing power.","","978-0-7695-3336-0","","10.1109/CSSE.2008.911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722720","machine learning;traffic classification","Computer science;Data engineering;Inspection;Machine learning;Payloads;Software engineering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","data mining;machine learning;statistical flow;traffic classifiers online;traffic flows;traffic patterns","","2","","22","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples.

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic.

Their main drawback is that they are more exposed to cyber-attack as data packets have to be relayed on a hop-by-hop basis. This paper presents a dynamically updating key distribution strategy, together with a message protection scheme in support of 4-way handshaking. For the 4-way handshaking, we propose a hash based encryption scheme to secure the unprotected message exchanges during the handshaking process. This is aimed at improving the resiliency of the network in the situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack. We then evaluate the security of the proposed scheme against cyber-attack, as well as network performance in terms of delay and overhead.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831169","EMSA;IEEE 802.11s;SAE;Smart Grid;security attacks;security protocols;wireless mesh networks","Authentication;Computer crime;Delays;Logic gates;Mesh networks;Microwave integrated circuits","computer network security;cryptography;real-time systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","4-way handshaking protection;HAN;NAN;cyber attack;data packets;denial of service attack;hash based encryption;home area networks;hop-by-hop basis;installation;key distribution;message protection;neighborhood area networks;real-time control;real-time monitoring;scalability;self-configuration;self-healing;smart grid;substation-plant-generation;wireless mesh network security;wireless mesh-sensor networks","","1","","20","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

S<sup>2</sup>RP aims at a trade-off between security and resource consumption while it guarantees an authentic distribution of keys that preserves both forward and backward security. The proposed protocol is efficient in terms of communication overhead as it reduces the number and the size of rekeying messages. It is efficient in terms of computation overhead as it guarantees the necessary level of confidentiality and authenticity of rekeying messages by only using symmetric ciphers and one-way hash functions. It follows that S<sup>2 </sup>RP meets the reduced capabilities of sensor nodes, results scalable, and particularly attractive for large and/or highly dynamic groups","","1-4244-0507-6","1-4244-0507-6","10.1109/MOBHOC.2006.278586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053932","","Broadcasting;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Protection;Public key cryptography;Security;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Surveillance;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;message authentication;wireless sensor networks","S<sup>2</sup>RP;hash functions;messages authenticity;secure-scalable rekeying protocol;wireless sensor networks","","5","","20","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, a lot of attacks against distributed environment are aimed at the trust management. This article presents a new trust management framework (TMF) for Mobile Ad hoc Networks. The proposed framework calculates a node's trust value based on observations from neighbour nodes by using Grey theory and Fuzzy sets. The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment. The TMF has shown good performance in calculating trust values of mobile wireless nodes under normal and abnormal (attack) conditions, and hence can be considered as an effective trust framework for MANETs.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120813","Fuzzy Se;Grey theory;MANET;Random Waypoint;trust management framework","Indexes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Wireless networks","fuzzy set theory;grey systems;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;TMF;fuzzy set theory;grey theory;malicious behaviour detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile wireless nodes;random waypoint mobility mode;selfish behaviour detection;trust management framework;wireless network security","","1","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A security service engine (SSE) with packet deep inspection ability is also designed to accompany with manageable L2 switches. By properly configuring the VLAN parameters, packets from switch ports of the L2 switch are forwarded to the SSE, via the gigabit Ethernet interface, for deeply inspection. For security reason, abnormal/malicious packets are dropped by the SSE directly while normal packets are forwarded back to the switch to the correct output port. To evaluate the performance and latency of the proposed architecture, a cost effective P4-based SSE is also implemented as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS) with layer-7 content inspection function. The obtained measurements show that the proposed architecture is practical with high throughput and low latency. With IPC-based SSE implementation, the traditional L2 switches can now provide content security service in a very cost effective way.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577789","","Cost function;Delay;Engines;Ethernet networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Security;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","local area networks;packet switching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","gigabit Ethernet interface;intrusion detection and prevention system;network security switch architecture;packet deep inspection;security service engine","","1","","10","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","978-0-7695-3347-6","","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","3","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the research compared the processing speed of these approaches with generic hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in Matlab and compared the accuracy of the clusters with the clusters created by human raters. The results show that both of the proposed approaches are more efficient and accurate than the generic hierarchical clustering algorithm.

Algorithms for detecting intrusions are under rapid development, but far from being mature. One interesting and difficult issue is how to study and test a new intrusion detection algorithm against a variety of (perhaps simulated) intrusive activities under realistic background traffic. A flexible and general-purpose platform for testing intrusion detection algorithms is clearly desirable. This paper presents such a software platform, called IntruDetector. With this platform, detection algorithms can be tested directly in a real environment with a wide range of intrusive activities. The data of normal system activities are directly collected from the live environment, and are mixed with intrusive activities that are simulated by hybrid simulation. The main properties of this approach are: (1) the background traffic is realistic; (2) it allows flexible simulation of various types of intrusions; and (3) normal system operation will not be disrupted by virtually simulated destructive intrusions during testing.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991516","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data security;Detection algorithms;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Software algorithms;Software testing;System testing;Traffic control","authorisation;hybrid simulation;program testing","IDS;IntruDetector;algorithm testing;flexible simulation;hybrid simulation;information infrastructure;intrusion detection system;monitoring;network intrusion detection;realistic background traffic;security information;software platform","","1","","24","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since profiling complex sequential data is still an open problem in anomaly detection, there is a need to explore new approaches. While previous research has used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for anomaly-based intrusion detection, the proposed models tend to increase rapidly in complexity in order to increase the detection rate while reducing the false detections. In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM). Our process trace clustering approach using HMMs for system call anomaly detection provides accurate results and reduces the complexity required to detect anomalies.

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic “in the dark”.","","978-1-4577-1481-8","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN","Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management","","0","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Historically, tracing individual packets by keeping packet logs at each router has required prohibitive amounts of memory; one of SPIE's key innovations is to reduce the memory requirement (down to 0.5% of link capacity) by storing only packet digests, that is, hashes of the packets rather than the packet itself. SPIE-enhanced routers maintain a cache of packet digests for recently forwarded traffic. If a packet is determined to be offensive by an intrusion detection system (or judged interesting by some other metric), a query is dispatched to the SPIE system that, in turn, queries routers for packet digests of the relevant time periods. ne results of this query are used in a simulated reverse-path flooding algorithm to build a highly reliable and accurate attack graph that identifies the packet's source or sources.","","0-7695-1897-4","","10.1109/DISCEX.2003.1194937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194937","","Computer crime;Data structures;Dissolved gas analysis;Engines;Floods;History;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;TCPIP;Technological innovation","security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","SPIE;Source Path Isolation Engine;attack graph;cache;forwarded traffic;hashes;intrusion detection system;memory requirement;packet digests;query;routers;simulated reverse-path flooding algorithm;single IP packet traceback;tap boxes","","0","","","","","22-24 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks","Nogueira, A.; Salvador, P.; Blessa, F.","Inst. de Telecomun., Univ. of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal","Digital Telecommunications (ICDT), 2010 Fifth International Conference on","20100729","2010","","","57","62","A concerted fight against botnets is needed in order to avoid them from becoming a serious threat to global security in the forthcoming years. Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IEEE 802.16e amendment to the IEEE 802.16 standard adds mobility to the original standard and thus makes WiMax an attractive solution to provide high bit rate mobile wireless services over a broader range of coverage. However, the last mile in open access networks remains vulnerable to attacks at the physical and MAC layers. This paper provides an overview of the security concerns and proposes a robust new architecture model to help protect against attacks from rogue devices for a true mobile security as wireless devices are becoming increasingly vulnerable mini computers.

Recently discovered wireless driver vulnerabilities exposed a new critical threat that legitimate users community is facing. What makes this vulnerability so dangerous to many of us is the fact that the actual exploitation cannot be prevented by commonly used tools such as firewalls, antivirus, and intrusion detection system's programs. Access to the victims machine is gained through a flawed third-party wireless driver, giving full kernel level access rights to the attacker. While kernel-level exploitation domain covers everything running beneath the operating systems, this paper describes wireless device drivers vulnerability and proposes methods for vulnerability mitigations.

In this paper, we investigate the use of trace abstraction techniques for reducing the execution time of anomaly detectors while keeping the same accuracy. The key idea is to represent system call traces as traces of kernel module interactions and use the resulting abstract traces as input to known anomaly detection techniques, such as STIDE (the Sequence Time-Delay Embedding) and HMM (Hidden Markov Models). We performed experiments on three datasets, namely, the traditional UNM dataset as well as two modern datasets, Firefox and ADFA-LD. The results show that kernel module traces can lead to similar or fewer false alarms and considerably smaller execution times compared to raw system call traces for host-based anomaly detection systems.","","978-1-4673-7556-6","","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208644","Host-based Anomaly Detection System;Software Dependability;Software Security;System Call Traces;Trace Analysis and Abstraction","Accuracy;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Testing;Training","embedded systems;hidden Markov models;safety-critical software","ADFA-LD;Firefox;HMM;STIDE;UNM dataset;execution time;hidden Markov model;high false alarm rate;host-based anomaly detection;sequence time-delay embedding;trace abstraction approach","","0","","38","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Artificial neural networks, evolutionary computation, DNA computation, and artificial immune systems are some of the researcher interest which can be highlighted. The human immune system (HIS) is a compound of molecules, cells, and organs which has established to perform several tasks; imperfect detection, distributed detection, adaptability, and generation of diversity, recognition, learning, memory acquisition, generalization, and optimization. New computational techniques are being developed basing on the immune system concepts, seeking to solve several engineering problems. Moreover, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have no clear line of defense and no fixed infrastructure; therefore, the known security techniques used for cabled networks might not work perfectly. A security architecture based on both immunity and multi-agent paradigm is presented. Distributability, second response, and self recovery, are the hallmarks of the proposed security model which places emphasis on high nodes mobility.","","978-1-4244-3396-4","978-1-4244-3397-1","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2008.4781710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781710","","Artificial immune systems;Artificial neural networks;Biology computing;Computer architecture;Computer networks;DNA computing;Evolutionary computation;Humans;Immune system;Mobile ad hoc networks","ad hoc networks;artificial immune systems;mobile radio;multi-agent systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","MANET;artificial immune system;biologically inspired security architecture;cabled network security;failure node recovery;human immune system;multi agent paradigm;secure hybrid mobile ad hoc network","","0","","13","","","16-18 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do that, we introduce two anomaly intrusion detection methods based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Those associative applications and services based on cloud computing are dramatically emerging. However, in order to enjoy the widely utilization of cloud computing through wired/wireless networking, providing sufficient assurance of information security such as confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity is the critical factor of success promotion. In this paper, a dynamic intrusion detection system for strengthening the security application of cloud computing is proposed. In the proposed mechanism, numbers of intrusion detectors are dispatched on the whole topology of the networking system through multi-layers and multi-stages deployment. Those information security issues related with the application and service of cloud computing will be experimented and discussed. The experiments include the equipment security of the client side termination, the threats of web site and webpage, the detection and diagnosis and surveillance of intrusion, the access and security of database in the cloud side, the detection of system leakage and the monitor of real-time repairing process, the management of server system, the management of mobile e-commerce processing, and the integrated analysis of associated security information and issues. The goal of the proposed mechanism is not only focused on find out some solutions, but also focused on develop some feasible information security techniques or products for the application and service of cloud computing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism does provide good performance for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-7671-8","978-89-88678-26-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5573246","Cloud computing;Internet hacking;Server as a service;information security;long term evolution","Authentication;Clouds;Fires;Robustness;Servers;Web sites;Wireless communication","Web services;Web sites;security of data","Web site;Webpage;associative applications;client side termination;cloud computing;dynamic intrusion detection system;information security;mobile e-commerce processing;multistages deployment;real-time repairing process;wired-wireless networking","","4","2","12","","","16-18 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they mostly stop at initial proposal or focus on framework design without detailed representation of intrusion or attack and relevant detection knowledge with ontology. In this paper, the design and implementation of ontology-based knowledge representation for a peer-to-peer multi-agent distributed intrusion detection system (ontology-based MADIDS) are introduced. An example which demonstrates the representation of an attack with ontology and the relevant detection process is also presented. In ontology-Based MADIDS, ontology technique enables peers in the system and agents in one peer to share common understanding of information. In addition, benefited from agent technology and P2P architecture, agents in ontology-based MADIDS not only detect attacks on a single host but also in a distributed domain. These features make the ontology-based MADIDS more flexible and robust.","","978-0-7695-3354-4","","10.1109/NPC.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663312","Intrusion Detection;Multi-Agent;Ontology;Peer-to-Peer","Application software;Australia;Computer science;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge representation;Ontologies;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Software engineering","multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;security of data","knowledge representation;ontology;peer-to-peer multiagent distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","17","","","18-21 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
