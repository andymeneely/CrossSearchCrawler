As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","14","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A victim who visits such a malicious web page will be compromised. Therefore, an efficient malicious web detection method is needed to prevent users from being compromised. Based on our observation, malicious web pages have uncommon behavior in order to evade from detection of Antivirus software. The anomaly behavior such as code encoding makes malicious web pages different from normal benign web pages. Current researches have noticed pattern-matching approach is not suitable to detect malicious web pages anymore, and then proposes a new detection method. The proposed method, a client-side malicious web page detection method, is based on anomaly behavior analysis. It focuses on distinguishing the behavior difference between malicious and benign web pages.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919","Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement","Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration","","3","","32","","2010-11-09","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

No protocol has been designed and implemented so far to parameterize security as a QoS parameter. However, it has been noted recently that security and QoS are highly intertwined; security mechanisms may severely affect QoS mechanisms in terms of network performance and data confidentiality. In addition, users are not given the choices on which security services and mechanisms as well as which security level should be applied to their traffic. A security-enhanced quality of service-based (SQoS) network has been presented recently, with two major objectives. One objective is to offer the users elastic choices on the treatment of messages with appropriate security mechanisms with respect to their own QoS and budget requirements. Another objective is to facilitate interaction between security and QoS mechanisms in the most efficient manner by providing information to each other.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","978-1-84919-909-4","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

These applications are themselves dependent on distributed information systems for all aspects of their operation and so survivability of the information systems is an important issue. Fault tolerance is a key mechanism by which survivability can be achieved in these information systems. Much of the literature on fault-tolerant distributed systems focuses on local error recovery by masking the effects of faults. We describe a direction for error recovery in the face of catastrophic faults, where the effects of the faults cannot be masked using available resources. The goal is to provide continued service that is either an alternate or degraded service by reconfiguring the system rather than masking faults.

DFA representations are popular, but suffer from the state-explosion problem. We introduce a new matching structure: a tree of DFAs where the DFA associated with a node over-approximates those at its children, and the DFAs at the leaves represent the signature set. Matching works top-down, starting at the root of the tree and stopping at the first node whose DFA does not match. In the common case (benign traffic) matching does not reach the leaves. DFA-trees are built using Compact Overapproximate DFAs (CODFAs). A CODFA D' for D over-approximates the language accepted by D, has a smaller number of states than D, and has a low false-match rate. Although built from approximate DFAs, DFA-trees perform exact matching faster than a commonly used method, have a low memory overhead and a guaranteed good worst case performance.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847977","","Approximation error;Automata;Computers;Conferences;DH-HEMTs;Payloads;Training","computational complexity;deterministic automata;digital signatures;finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;tree data structures","CODFAs;DFA-trees;IPSs;NP-hard problem;benign traffic matching;compact overapproximate DFAs;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;intrusion prevention system;low false-match rate;low memory overhead;matching structure;parametrized language overapproximation;regular expressions;state-explosion problem;vulnerability signatures","","1","","30","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike existing work, we consider a trust metric considering both quality of service (QoS) trust and social trust for detecting malicious nodes. By statistically analyzing peer-to-peer trust evaluation results collected from sensor nodes, each cluster head applies trust-based intrusion detection to assess the trustworthiness and maliciousness of sensor nodes in its cluster. Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability. We analyze the sensitivity of false alarms with respect to the minimum trust threshold below which a node is considered malicious. Our results show that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Further, the optimal trust threshold differs depending on the anticipated wireless sensor network lifetime.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5963250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963250","","Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","peer-to-peer computing;probability;protocols;quality of service;safety systems;wireless sensor networks","QoS;base station;false alarm probability;high scalable hierarchical trust management protocol;malicious nodes;peer-to-peer trust evaluation;quality of service;stochastic Petri nets;trust-based intrusion detection;wireless sensor network lifetime","","12","","10","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, as the size of rule set is increasing to tens of thousands, novel packet classification algorithms must have good scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel packet classification algorithm named DBS (discrete bit selection) which takes a bit level heuristic design to partition the rule set effectively. To the best of our knowledge, DBS is the first try to design a heuristic classification algorithm at bit-level. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, DBS is deployed on a popular multi-core network processor platform, compared with two existing well-known algorithms. Experimental results show that DBS achieves 300% higher throughput than HiCuts and HSM, while the memory requirement is reduced to about 10% averagely. DBS works well especially with large rule set (10K), which trends a good scalability.","1521-9097","978-1-4244-5788-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395268","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;High-speed networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Satellite broadcasting;Scalability;Throughput","Internet;pattern classification","bit level heuristic design;bit-level heuristic packet classification algorithm;discrete bit selection;high speed Internet;multicore network processor platform","","5","","19","","","8-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response.

Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing","","0","","26","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low cost VLSI fabrication, unbounded scalability, and high speed constant-rate throughput independent of pattern number and complexity breaks current trade space constraints. This paper introduces features of the processor architecture responsible for the decoupling, and shows how current tradeoff structure is altered.","","978-0-7695-3568-5","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804453","Hardware-Assisted System Security Monitor;pattern recognition","Computer security;Costs;Couplings;Fabrication;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Phase detection;Terrorism;Very large scale integration","VLSI;finite state machines;pattern recognition;reconfigurable architectures","finite state machines;pattern recognition;reconfigurable VLSI processor architecture;scalable accuracy;speed-accuracy tradeoff","","3","","12","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a self-organizable architecture, which can reorganize and reconfigure a system based on modular agents. It is contrived through observation of biological phenomena, and implements a platform to host the architecture in dynamically changing environments.

Even a rare vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network security of an entire organisation. Intrusion Detection Systems form an integral component of the mechanisms designed to prevent internet and data communication systems from such attacks. The attacks on the network comprise of information gathering and modification through unauthorized access to resources and denial of service to legitimate users. IDS play a key role in detecting the patterns of behaviour on the network that might be indicative of impending attacks. Majority of groundbreaking research on IDS is carried out on KDD'99 dataset and focuses on either all the attacks in the network or the attacks corresponding to TCP/IP protocol. This paper presents a step forward in this direction where the IDS model addresses a specific part of the network attacks commonly detected at port 7 in UDP. Port scans in UDP account for a sizable portion of the Internet traffic and comparatively little research characterizes security in UDP port scan activity. To meet the growing trend of attacks and other security challenges in the constantly evolving internet arena, this is paper presents a computationally intelligent intrusion detection mechanism using swarm intelligence paradigm, particularly ant colony optimisation, to analyze sample network traces in UDP port scans. This work aims at generating customised and efficient network intrusion detection systems using soft computing to increase general network security through specific network security.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745415","Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO);Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);User Datagram Protocol (UDP);attacks;network security;perpetual echo;port scans","Computers;Internet;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems","ant colony optimisation;computer network security;transport protocols","Internet traffic;TCP/IP protocol;ant colony optimization;computer network security;computer networks escalating complexity;denial of service;intelligent intrusion detection mechanism;intelligent perpetual echo attack detection;malicious exploitation probability;unauthorized access;user datagram protocol port 7","","0","","18","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem. In particular, our scheme incorporates a list technique, namely the blacklist to help filter network packets based on the confidence of the IP domains. Moreover, our scheme will adapt and update the blacklist contents by using the method of statistic-based blacklist generation according to the actual network environment. In the experiment, we implemented our scheme and showed the first experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122798","blacklist;intrusion detection;network packet filter","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Table lookup","IP networks;security of data;statistical analysis;string matching","CPU occupancy rate;IP domains;adaptive context-aware packet filter scheme;false alarm rate;signature-based network intrusion detection system;statistic-based blacklist generation;string matching","","0","","20","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid - the home area network (HAN), neighborhood area network (NAN), and the Wide Area Network (WAN) - where they will use Artificial Immune System (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyber attacks. AMs at each level will be trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection.

However, there has only a few research related to similarity evaluation under data stream contexts. The main reason is because of the native feature of data streams, namely, large, continuous, and only one pass scan. It is hard to find an efficient method to evaluate similarity over data streams. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm ESDS(estimating similarity over data streams), which not only can estimate similarity efficiently over data streams under the time warping distance but is the first time to use DTW(dynamic time warping) distance based on the sliding window to deal with similarity evaluation over data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first paper to address this problem. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, we present a simple but efficiently method to denote the original stream data. In computing the distance of DTW between data streams by using dynamic programming, we also introduce a new distance of DTW which can compute the similarity over data streams efficiently. The experiments of many real and synthetic data sets show that our algorithm can evaluate the similarity over data streams efficiently and not be studied in the previous research.","","978-0-7695-2874-8","","10.1109/FSKD.2007.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406201","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer networks;Data analysis;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Electrostatic discharge;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Sun","data handling;dynamic programming;security of data;time warp simulation","data streams;dynamic programming;dynamic time warping;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor queries","","1","","18","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One such solution to overcome selfishly behaving nodes in wireless network is to detect and exclude them .There are several secure routing protocols to detect routing misbehavior in the direct neighborhood. In this paper, we presented an improved version of Leak detector mechanism and iterative probing mechanism to detect colluding malicious nodes, manipulations of route in wireless multi hop networks. Leak detector enables the calculation of the packet-loss ratio for the individual nodes. Iterative probing enables reliable detection of selfish nodes that drop packets in a MANET.

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.","","978-1-4244-7675-6","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679879","","Bayesian methods;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Intrusion detection;Lead;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing","distributed processing;security of data;software agents;software fault tolerance","IDS;autonomous agents;cooperating agents;fault-tolerant distributed intrusion detection system;malicious intruders;networked system security;robust distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lack of proper tools slows down the hunt for information, which would otherwise help in gaining the upper hand against IT based perpetrators. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper. The evaluation of the new method shows a detection rate of 99.2 %, without generating any false positives, when used to scan for JPEG data. The slowest implementation of the algorithm scans a 72.2 MB file in approximately 2.5 seconds and scales linearly","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652088","","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data mining;File systems;Forensics;Hard disks;Information science;Military computing;Telecommunication traffic","police data processing","JPEG data;Oscar method;binary structure;byte frequency distribution;computer forensics tools;data categorization;data fragments;file type identification;working file system","","13","1","14","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most efficient string-matching algorithm in usual applications is the well-known Boyer-Moore (BM) algorithm. The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel fast string-matching algorithm to detect the exact and like occurrences of a given pattern within input string. It is based on computing the sum of character's values in the search string and comparing this sum with the sum of the values of the corresponding characters in the sliding window. The sliding window includes number of characters equals that of the search string and is right shifted from the beginning and toward the end of the input string. The experimental results reveal that the novel algorithm appears more efficient than BM many times in worst case, and the longer the pattern, the bigger the performance improvement.","","978-1-4799-0460-0","","10.1109/WCCIT.2013.6618726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618726","String matching;algorithmic performance attack;network security","Algorithm design and analysis;Force;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching","Internet;computer network security;search problems;string matching","BM algorithm;Boyer-Moore algorithm;Web security;exact occurrence detection;exact string matching algorithm;fast string matching algorithm;input string;like occurrence detection;like string matching algorithm;network security;performance improvement;search string","","0","","13","","","22-24 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to overcome that issue, we proposed a new framework for malware behavior identification and classification that apply dynamic approach.

Existing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are found to be limited in performance and utility especially once subjected to heavy traffic conditions. It has been observed that NIDS become less effective even when presented with a bandwidth of a few hundred megabits per second. In this work, we have endeavored to identify the causes which lead to unsatisfactory performance of NIDSs. In this regard, we have conducted an extensive performance evaluation of an open source intrusion detection system (Snort). This has been done on a highly sophisticated test-bench with different traffic conditions. We have also used different hardware and software platforms to determine the efficacy of the NIDS under test. Finally, in our results/ analysis, we have identified the factors responsible for the limited performance of Snort.

One of the biggest barriers in developing the mobile communication device is security. To protect itself against security threats, the mobile communication device need to be loaded with various kinds of security functions such as firewall, access control, and so on. However because the mobile communication device has relatively poor computing power and inconvenient user interface, it may experience performance deterioration and user inconveniency in case that it employs all the security functions. This paper proposes a context-aware dynamic security configuration scheme for effective security management of the mobile communication device. Our scheme can maximize the performance of the mobile communication device in terms of computing resource efficiency and user convenience without degrading security level by automatically optimizing its security configuration based on its security context.

The privacy of users is of paramount importance to administrators and organizations, which are reluctant to cooperate between each other and exchange network traffic traces. The main reasons behind reluctance to exchange monitored data are the protection of the users' privacy and the fear of information leakage about the internal infrastructure. Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic. Our effort focuses on the design and implementation of a generic and flexible anonymization framework that provides extended functionality, covering multiple aspects of anonymization needs and allowing fine-tuning of privacy protection level. The proposed framework is composed by an anonymization application programming interface (AAPI).

We have developed an algorithm that tracks multiple (n) characteristics per flow, and requires updating only the flow's n values upon an event, not all the values for all the flows. The n correlation values are used as coordinates for a point in n-space; two flows are considered correlated if there is a very small Euclidean distance between them.

The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security. This paper focuses on strong security by detecting and preventing attacks, also ensures data authentication, integrity of data and solves less power transmission of data and receiver collision problem, by deploying hybrid mechanism.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164714","AODV;CAWS;EAACK;MES-1;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor network","Communication system security;Encryption;Intrusion detection;Standards;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV scheme;CAWS;EAACK mechanism;MES-1;ad hoc on demand distance vector scheme;attack prevention;black-hole attack detection;cryptography method;data authentication;data integrity;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;gray-hole attack detection;intrusion detection system;modern encryption standard;receiver collision problem;wireless sensor network security","","0","","17","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A real time approach for QRS detection of ECG signal using network intrusion detection technique","Chandrakar, C.; Sharma, M.","Electron. & Telecommun., CSVTU, Bhilai, India","Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT), 2015 IEEE International Conference on","20150827","2015","","","1","6","The QRS complex is the most striking waveform within the electrocardiogram (ECG). QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. We proposed a novel method for detection of QRS complexes in ECG signals using Network Intrusion Detection technique used for detection of worm in networking applications for finding the frequently repeated strings in a packet stream. A novel real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing is proposed in this paper. Our technique relies more on the data stream corresponding to ECG beats than any particular feature. We use the concept of shared counters to minimize the memory requirement while efficiently shifting through suspicious strings. The algorithm automatically adjusts parameters periodically to adapt to ECG changes as QRS morphology and heart rate. The proposed algorithm correctly detects QRS complexes with negligible false positive and negative detection.","","978-1-4799-6084-2","","10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226131","QRS complex;hashing;repeated binary strings;shared counters","Electrocardiography;Indexes;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Robustness","bioelectric potentials;electrocardiography;medical signal detection;medical signal processing","ECG signal detection;automated ECG analysis algorithms;data stream;electrocardiogram;heart rate;network intrusion detection technique;real-time QRS detection technique;two-phase hashing;worm detection","","0","","23","","","5-7 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the types and number of users of the internet increases, the requirement of an effective Intrusion Detection System(IDS) to detect these attacks also increases. Different techniques such as data mining and pattern recognition are being used to design IDS. One of the major challenges faced while designing IDSs is maximizing the accuracy of detection. To address this issue, this paper has used Ensemble of classifiers approach where each class uses different learning paradigm. The classifiers used for experimentation are Naive Bayesian(NB), Bayesian Network(BN), Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO), J48(C4.5) and Reduced Error Pruning Tree(REPTree). Experimental results show improvements in detection accuracy for Denial of Service attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICGCE.2013.6823550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823550","Bayesian Network;Denial of Service Attack;Ensemble of Classifiers;Feature selection;Intrusion Detection System;J48;Naïve Bayesian;Reduced Error Pruning Tree;Sequential Minimal Optimization","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Decision trees;Optimization;Testing;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;trees (mathematics)","BN;Bayesian network;DDoS;DoS;IDS design;Internet;NB;Naive Bayesian;REPTree;SMO;classifiers ensemble;data mining;denial-of-service attacks;distributed denial-of-service attacks;intrusion detection system;learning paradigm;pattern recognition;reduced error pruning tree;sequential minimal optimization","","0","","17","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Industrial control system networks should be far more restricted in what types of traffic diversity is present. This enables the usage of approaches that are currently not as feasible in open environments, such as machine learning based anomaly detection. Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for different restricted network environments of which an industrial control system network is an good example of. In this paper we present an initial analysis of data received from a ethernet network of a live running industrial site. This includes both control data and the data flowing between the control network and the office network. A set of possible features to be used for detecting anomalies is studied for this environment.","","978-1-4673-5146-1","","10.1109/GreenCom.2012.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6468407","Information security;industrial control systems;network security","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Monitoring;Production facilities;Protocols","computer network security;control engineering computing;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);local area networks;telecommunication traffic","control data;ethernet network;feature selection;industrial control system network environment;industrial site;machine learning based anomaly detection;office network;open networks;traffic diversity","","0","","17","","","20-23 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It enables entities to cope with uncertainty and uncontrollability caused by the free will of others. Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches. In addition, we analyze various works on trust dynamics including trust propagation, prediction and aggregation algorithms, the influence of network dynamics on trust dynamics and the impact of trust on security services.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.042711.00083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770276","Aggregation;MANET;Propagation;Security;Trust Computations","Ad hoc networks;Measurement;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Sensors","computational complexity;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET;computational complexity constraint;mobile ad hoc networks;network dynamics;security services;trust computations;trust computing;trust dynamics","","39","","144","","2011-05-19","Second Quarter 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Fifth International Conference on","20091009","2009","1","","154","157","There are two main approaches for implementing IDS; host based and network based. While the former is implemented in the form of software deployed on a host, the latter, usually is built as a hardware product with its own hardware platform (IDS appliance). In this paper, a host based intrusion detection system, that uses the idea of tracing system calls, is introduced. As a program runs, it uses the services of the underlying operating system to do some system calls. This system does not exactly need to know the program codes of each process. Normal and intrusive behaviors are collected with gathering the sequences of system calls for each process. Analysis of data is done via data mining and fuzzy techniques. Data mining is used to extract the normal behavior. The proposed system is shown to improve the performance, and decrease size of database, time complexity, and the rate of false alarms.","","978-0-7695-3744-3","","10.1109/IAS.2009.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283792","Data mining;Fuzzy;Operating system;Process-based Intrusion Detection;kernel;system calls","Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Databases;Detectors;Fuzzy systems;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Turing machines","data analysis;data mining;security of data","data analysis;data mining technique;fuzzy intrusion detection system;host based intrusion detection system;system calls;time complexity","","0","","9","","","18-20 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
