Many researchers in the field of network security and system survivability have been developing mechanisms to detect DoS attacks. By doing so they hope to maximize accurate detections (true-positive) and minimize non-justified detections (false-positive). This research proposes a lightweight method to identify DoS attacks by analyzing host behaviors. Our method is based on the concept of BLINd Classification or BLINC: no access to packet payload, no knowledge of port numbers, and no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern. In this work we create three types of graphlets for the following DoS attack patterns: SYN flood, ICMP flood, and host scan. Results show that our method can identify all occurrences and all hosts associated with attack activities, with a low percentage of false positive.","1556-6463","978-1-4244-1230-3","978-1-4244-1230-3","10.1109/ICON.2007.4444065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444065","","Availability;Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computer science;Floods;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","Internet;computer network reliability;telecommunication security","DoS attack;Internet;denial of service;lightweight detection;network security;system survivability","","4","","19","","","19-21 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness","backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data","Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language","","4","1","36","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an innovative packet classification algorithm, called partial paralleled algorithm based on plus bits (P3). P3 algorithm begins by two paralleled single-field engines and followed by hash table of the remained 3 fields. A novel structure, plus bits, is introduced to reduce hash memory accesses. For a 4k filterset, P3 algorithm can achieve about 9 memory accesses on average, taking 326 KB of memory for its data structure and supporting incremental update.

As the SIP is gaining popularity, open architecture of VoIP often makes SIP vulnerable to so many threats. The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT. This paper has provided the effective mechanism in creating well-formed defense against malicious SIP message attacks to ensure the integrity and security of VoIP subsystems.","","","","10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083519","Intrusion detection system;Malicious message;SIP;SQL injection;VoIP","Inspection;Internet;Protocols;Security;Servers;Standards;Syntactics","Internet telephony;client-server systems;computer network security;digital signatures;public domain software;signalling protocols;virtual machines","BackTrack7;IDS;Kphone;SER;SIP clients;SIP server;SIP-based infrastructure security;SIPSAK;SNORT;Session Initiation Protocol;VMware;VoIP communication;VoIP subsystem integrity;VoIP subsystem security;Voice over Internet Protocol communication;Windows 7;X-lite;attack signature generation technique;attack-signature generation framework;attacking tool;configuration file;detection rule improvement;intrusion detection system;logical error identification;malformed SIP message identification;malicious SIP message attacks;malicious SIP messages;malicious message attacks;malicious message identification;open architecture;open source IDS;open source SIP server;processing overheads;regular expression;security mechanisms;signaling protocol;signature database;testbed architecture;threat vulnerability;virtual environment","","0","","8","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

Intrusion detection can successfully prevent many attempts to crash network and hamper web services by intruders and hackers. The classification data mining approaches are proposed and used effectively for intrusion detection. However, presences of ambiguous data packets which exhibit traits of two or more classes reduce the overall accuracy of classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity. Further, we also examined whether FCM clustering and RKM clustering can help to determine class of ambiguous packets exactly or approximately.

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members. Using this technique, the overhead on centralized server is reduced. Moreover, the need of each node storing all public keys are diminished thus minimizing the storage overhead on each node.

Events for monitoring computing networks occur at different system levels. Some information might relate to data, some might be operating system specific, some application or service related, some could be network related, and from each there will be compound events that describe incident effects and information about the situation context. All together there can be thousands of events per second. Today's approaches to monitoring networks are typically centralized, sending events over the network to a single engine for analysis. Centralized monitoring ultimately cannot scale to address the volume of events that one would ideally like to be able to monitor, so techniques of today often make severe compromises relating to the events that they ingest. Centralized monitoring creates a single point of failure and also generates significant network load. To overcome these deficiencies we have developed a more distributed, approach: our reasoner agents can (in theory) be installed on every monitored resources and the reasoner language (used for programming the reasoners) enables knowledge in a reasoner's working memory to be synchronized over multiple reasoners enabling them to implement parallel distributed reasoning algorithms that are able detect event patterns irrespective of whether the events are local or remote. Distributing the reasoning makes the system extremely resilient. Additionally, since the knowledge shared between the reasoning agents represents summary information, and because many on-line event correlation algorithms often suppress reporting once an incident has been reported, the amount of network load needed to support the distributed monitoring can actually be reduced. To demonstrate our approach we describe its application to the monitoring of a computing network that has been instrumented to protect it - - against 0-day email virus attacks.","2155-7578","978-1-4244-8178-1","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680347","autonomic response;distributed reasoning;event correlation;intelligent agents;network and security monitoring;parallel programs","Cognition;Correlation;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;computer viruses;electronic mail;inference mechanisms;parallel processing","Otto-Mate;computing networks;email virus attacks;operating system;parallel distributed reasoning algorithms;parallel distributed reasoning system;reasoner language;reasoning agents","","0","","11","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TRR dynamically and randomly relocates a program's stack, heap, shared libraries, and parts of its runtime control data structures inside the application memory address space. Making a program's memory layout different each time it runs foils the attacker's assumptions about the memory layout of the vulnerable program and makes the determination of critical address values difficult if not impossible. TRR is implemented by changing the Linux dynamic program loader, hence it is transparent to applications. We demonstrate that TRR is effective in defeating real security attacks, including malloc-based heap overflow, integer overflow, and double-free attacks, for which effective prevention mechanisms are yet to emerge. Furthermore, TRR incurs less than 9% program startup overhead and no runtime overhead.","1060-9857","0-7695-1955-5","","10.1109/RELDIS.2003.1238076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238076","","Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer crime;Data security;Information security;Invasive software;Linux;Operating systems;Protection;Runtime","Unix;safety-critical software","TRR;application memory address space;attack prevention;dynamic program loader;security attacks;software implementation vulnerabilities;transparent runtime randomization","","27","1","26","","","6-18 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider.

For computer system security, VMs can be used to detect malware intrusions and to protect critical components, which can be implemented by integrating detection or protection mechanism in either VMM or VMs. Authentication is required to create trustful VMs. This paper surveys technologies related of using virtual machines to enhance system security.","","978-0-7695-3818-1","","10.1109/ChinaGrid.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328990","Critical component;Isolation;Security;Virtual Machine;Virtual Machine Monitor","Application software;Computer applications;Data security;Kernel;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","invasive software;virtual machines","access control;authentication;computer system security;critical components;guest OS;malware intrusions;virtual machine monitor","","1","3","48","","","21-22 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm.

IEEE 34th Conference on","20091218","2009","","","899","906","Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","","978-1-4244-4488-5","978-1-4244-4487-8","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the security of guest virtual machines and of the applications and services they host can be improved by leveraging the additional architectural layer introduced by such a technology. This paper discusses security management for virtualized environments and provides several contributions. First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls. We believe that security management of both single virtualized hosts and distributed virtualized systems can benefit from our proposal.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578474","Malware;Security;Virtualization technology","Computer architecture;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","Kvm-SMA;distributed virtualized system;kernel virtual machine;root-kit detection test;security management architecture","","1","","15","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11 specific intrusions. Our model of feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a mean to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm.","","978-1-4244-1751-3","978-1-4244-1752-0","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530270","Feature Selection;Information Gain Ratio;Intrusion Detection Systems;K-means;Wireless Networks","Accuracy;Degradation;Detectors;Face detection;Filters;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Protocols;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","access protocols;feature extraction;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;MAC layer;TCP/IP header;feature selection;illegal penetration;intrusion detection system;k-means classifier","","2","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","5","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, normal-anomaly patterns are built over the network traffic dataset that uses subtractive clustering, and at the same time the built Hidden Markov Model (HMM) correlates the observation sequences and state transitions to predict the most probable intrusion state sequences.

An automated and adaptive defensive tool is imperative for computer networks. One of the emerging solutions for Network Security is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, this technology still faces some challenges such as low detection rates, high false alarm rates and requirement of heavy computational power. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning algorithm called Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) which utilizes semi-parametric learning model and Adaptive boosting techniques to reduce learning bias and generalization variance in difficult classification. In this paper, BMPNN is implemented as a classifier to detect different types of network anomalies in the KDD-99 benchmark. Extensive experimental outcome indicates that the proposed BMPNN outperforms other state-of-the-art learning algorithms in terms of detection accuracy and model robustness at an affordable computational cost.","","0-7803-9490-9","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716408","Artificial Neural Network;Generalization Variance;Learning Bias;Network Intrusion Detection","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Power system modeling;Power system security","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;telecommunication security","adaptive boosting techniques;boosted modified probabilistic neural network;computer networks;distributed computer systems;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection;network security techniques;semiparametric learning model","","1","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed system is designed to deal the fragmented and out-of-order packets. Fragmentation is the term given to the process of breaking down an IP datagram into smaller packets to be transmitted over different types of network media and then reassembling them at the other end. In most cases, depending upon the actual security device defending the network, there are typically multiple fragmentation techniques and packet size combinations capable of squeezing and exploiting protection device on a network. We present an efficient multi pattern algorithm for regular expression matching on streams with fragmented and out of order data, while maintaining a small state and without complete stream reconstruction. It improves the performance of Intrusion Detection System for detecting the fragmented and Out-of-Order packet attack.

The key features of the Swift include: 1) extremely low filter update latency for dynamic packet filtering, and 2) gigabits-per-second high-speed packet processing. Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540","Linux kernel networking;packet filter","Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security","information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing","BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data","","0","","29","","2011-02-24","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956","anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis","Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training","security of data","file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits","","2","","24","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures. This paper presents a method which uses the Cell architecture to run an adapted speculative parallel pattern matching algorithm.

PEGs also facilitate derivation of both static and dynamic scheduling techniques,depending on the amount of variability in task execution times and other operating conditions. We show how to implement efficient PEG-based scheduling methods using real time operating systems, and to re-use pre-optimized libraries of DSP components within such implementations. Empirical results show that the PEG strategy can 1) achieve significant speedups on a state of the art multicore signal processor platform for static dataflow applications with predictable execution times,and 2) exceed classical scheduling speedups for application shaving execution times that can vary dynamically.

And this algorithm is applied to the intrusion detection systems so as to approach the traditional problem of inadequate real-time intrusion detection.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

The number of security-breaking attempts originated inside the organizations is increasing steadily. Attacks made in this way, usually done by ""authorized"" users of the system cannot be immediately traced. As the idea of filtering the traffic at the entrance door, by using firewalls and the like, is not completely successful, the use of intrusion detection systems should be considered to increase the defense capacity of an information system. This paper presents a NeuroC4.5 based approach to network intrusion detection to detect anomalies in the computer networks. Decision tree is with good comprehensibility while neural network is with strong generalization ability. So, these merits are integrated into a novel decision tree algorithm NeuroC4.5. The NeuroC4.5 is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data. The generated rules are then used to detect network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing decision tree based approaches, the spawned rules are more effective because the generalization ability of NeuroC4.5 decision trees is better than that of C4.5 decision trees. A comparative evaluation of the proposed NeuroC4.5 model with the classical C4.5 algorithm, on audit data set provided by MIT Lincoln labs, has been presented; superior detection accuracy has been reported by our proposed model","","1-4244-0369-3","1-4244-0370-7","10.1109/INDCON.2006.302774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086245","Decision Tree;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Network Security;Neural Network","Authentication;Computer networks;Decision trees;Educational institutions;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","authorisation;computer networks;decision trees;filtering theory;information systems;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","MIT Lincoln labs;NeuroC4.5 algorithm;computer networks;decision tree algorithm;firewall;information system;network intrusion detection;neural network;traffic filtering","","0","","12","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Not all communications are credible and malpractice can arise anywhere, anytime. If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A lightweight countermeasure to cope with flooding attacks against session initiation protocol","Hussain, I.; Djahel, S.; Geneiatakis, D.; Nait-Abdesselam, F.","LIPADE, Univ. of Paris Descartes, Paris, France","Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC), 2013 6th Joint IFIP","20130627","2013","","","1","5","Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a widely used protocol for voice and video communication in Internet architecture. Due to its open nature and the lack of robust security mechanisms, SIP is vulnerable to several attacks similar to those existing in Internet infrastructure, such as the flooding attack. An attacker can use any SIP request to launch a flooding attack, leading to severe consequences at either client or server side SIP elements or both of them. In this context, end user's devices are considered more vulnerable to flooding attacks due to their limited capabilities. In this paper, we focus on INVITE flooding attack for which we propose a simple and robust detection scheme. This scheme prevents an attacker from launching an INVITE flood through a transition state table used by the proxy to analyse the incoming INVITE requests and exclude the suspicious ones. Our scheme requires also that the end-user keeps track of the time and IP addresses of each incoming request. Furthermore, we modify the header of the REGISTER request by adding a new field named Critical number which holds the value of maximum number of users or callers that could easily be handled by the end user. Unlike the existing solutions, our scheme does not require any special detection device or firewall at the SIP server. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in SIP Express Router (SER) and the obtained results have confirmed its effectiveness.","","978-1-4673-5615-2","978-1-4673-5614-5","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549057","Denial of Service;INVITE Flooding Attack;Security;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)","Computer crime;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers;Time factors","IP networks;Internet telephony;computer network security;network servers;routing protocols;signalling protocols;video communication","INVITE flooding attack;IP address;Internet;REGISTER request header;SER;SIP express router;SIP server;critical number;firewall;incoming INVITE request analysis;lightweight countermeasure;robust detection scheme;robust security mechanism;session initiation protocol;transition state table;video communication;voice communication","","0","","13","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among these, IAASNT's multi-level low-power management and integrated tracking frame set it different from other related platforms. The integrated tracking frame is the core of the system and has been carefully designed, to achieve a self-acting tracking service.

There have been many approaches researched to tackle the issue. In this paper, we look into an anomaly-based intrusion detection system to detect compromised nodes in wireless sensor networks.

Our platform provides three major advantages over previously proposed approaches, 1) security insulation from remote exploits and attacks; 2) close coupling between processor cores in a CMP to ensure immediate logging, fine-grained inspection and fast recovery; 3) concurrent and fine-grained inspection, logging and recovery techniques that are off of the critical path. We have designed a multi-point defense and recovery system to defeat remote exploits. We used a checkpoint based approach to recover server applications under attack. It takes a snapshot of the application's context and memory state before it handles the next request. If the request turns out to be malicious, the system can discard the malicious request and rollback the application's state to a known good one through checkpointing. We have also designed an rapid recovery system for kernel space rootkit attacks.

When at the moment of a user really use the device, outbound traffic of a user can be observed by each user, all outbound traffic doesn't need to inspect as suspicious traffic. For inspecting a suspicious traffic, it doesn't need to prepare not whole pattern string set but a part of pattern string set.

Since effective remediation requires that the right actions be taken at the right time, in order for SEC&DEP monitoring to be really useful, the results of the monitoring process must be made available in a timely fashion, i.e. in (near) real-time. A plethora of technologies exists, that individually represent a (potentially) effective building block of a real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility, but - regrettably - they very much lack integration. We claim that a significant advancement in the convergence of such technologies is needed. While recently some achievements have been made, much is yet to be done. In this paper, we briefly review the current State Of The Art (SOTA) of technologies that can be used to implement a real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility, with two objectives: 1) perform a gap analysis, i.e. point out the major limitations of such technologies, and 2) identify the main avenues towards effective SEC&DEP monitoring.","","978-1-4799-3530-7","","10.1109/CCST.2014.6987018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987018","Event Collection;Event Correlation;Fault and Intrusion Tolerance;Real-time monitoring","Business;Correlation;Monitoring;Random access memory;Real-time systems;Security;Sensors","fault tolerant computing;security of data","building block;monitoring process;real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility;real-time security & dependability monitoring","","0","","24","","","13-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
