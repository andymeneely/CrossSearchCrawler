Consequently e-Healthcare application providers are adopting Cloud computing to handle immense processing load and to reduce service delivery cost. Identity management has been an issue which hinders in adoption of e-Healthcare applications, due to sensitivity of the data involved in it. Existing Cloud based e-Healthcare applications provide access to their services though Single-Sign-On (SSO) protocols. Traditional SSO uses asymmetric encryption, thus increasing the execution load on Cloud gateway and on Identity Provider as well. In this paper we propose a methodology of SSO for Cloud applications by utilizing Peer-to-Peer concepts to distribute processing load among computing nodes within Cloud. The proposed scheme, called Chord for Cloud (C4C), decreases the number of authentication request send to Identity Provider and disseminates the authentication process within the federated environment of Cloud, through Chord algorithm.

Above all, the data set is classified into two clusters by FCM. Then, support vector machine (SVM) with a fuzzy membership function is to testify whether the data set can be further classified. Thus, the result of clusters can be obtained by repeating the computation process. Because affiliating matrix, obtained by the introduction of SVM into FCM, is defined to be the fuzzy membership function, each different input data sample can have different penalty value, and the separating hyper-plane is optimized. F-CMSVM is an unsupervised algorithm in which it is neither needed to label training data set nor specify clustering number.

Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on","20030521","2003","","","44","61","A critical problem faced by a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is that of ambiguity. The NIDS cannot always determine what traffic reaches a given host nor how that host will interpret the traffic, and attackers may exploit this ambiguity to avoid detection or cause misleading alarms. We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests. We found wide variation across operating systems' TCP/IP stack policies in real-world tests (about 6700 hosts), underscoring the need for this sort of disambiguation.","1081-6011","0-7695-1940-7","","10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199327","","Costs;Databases;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Prototypes;Runtime;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","authorisation;computer network management;network operating systems;network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","NIDS evasion;TCP/IP-based ambiguity;active mapping;disambiguation;host TCP/IP policies;host profiles;misleading alarms;network intrusion detection system;network topology profiles;operating systems;traffic","","26","28","20","","","11-14 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed algorithm performs independently partial pattern matching to extract the pattern from incoming multiple packets at multi gigabit network. The IPM is implemented by FPGA, TCAM and SRAM. Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

A new approach to system call monitoring based on authenticated system calls is introduced. An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls.

Frequently, the transfer function is designed based on mapping one or two dimensional space to color properties (RGB) and opacity (A). We propose visualization and interaction methods for analyzing individual clusters as well as cluster distribution within and across levels in the cluster hierarchy. We also provide a clustering method that operates on density rather than individual records. We compute density in the given multidimensional multivariate space. Clusters are formed by areas of high density. We present an approach that automatically computes a hierarchical tree of high density clusters. To visually represent the cluster hierarchy, we present a 2D radial layout that supports an intuitive understanding of the distribution structure of the multidimensional multivariate data set. We apply a semi-automatic coloring scheme based on the 2D radial layout of the hierarchical cluster tree encoding hue, saturation, and value of the HSV color space.

"A graph-based clustering algorithm for anomaly intrusion detection","Zhou Mingqiang; Huang Hui; Wang Qian","Coll. of Comput. Sci., Chongqing Univ., Chongqing, China","Computer Science & Education (ICCSE), 2012 7th International Conference on","20120906","2012","","","1311","1314","Many researchers have argued that data mining can improve the performance of intrusion detection system. So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance.

This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set.

It is hard to find an IP packet that has not passed over an Ethernet segment. One important reason for this is Ethernet's simplicity and ease of configuration. However, Ethernet has always been known to be an insecure technology. Recent successful malware attacks and the move towards cloud computing in data centers demand that attention be paid to the security aspects of Ethernet. In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities. Major issues, like insecurities related to Address Resolution Protocol and to self-configurability, are discussed. The solutions fall roughly into three categories: accepting Ethernet's insecurity and circling it with firewalls; creating a logical separation between the switches and end hosts; and centralized cryptography based schemes. However, none of the above provides the perfect combination of simplicity and security befitting Ethernet.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2012.121112.00190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407456","Data security;Ethernet networks;Security","IP networks;Local area networks;Ports (Computers);Routing protocols;Security;Switches","IP networks;cryptography;firewalls;invasive software;local area networks;protocols","Ethernet LAN security;Ethernet segment;IP packet;address resolution protocol;centralized cryptography;cloud computing;data centers;firewalls;malware attacks","","0","","82","","2013-01-09","Third Quarter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game.

In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds.

Linear prediction is employed to extract features from system calls sequences of the privileged processes which are used to make up of the character database of those processes, and then the Markov chain model is founded based on those features. The observed behavior of the system is analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov chain model of the norm profile supports the observed behavior.

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt. For heap overflow vulnerability, we can automatically exploit the unlink() macro of glibc, which formerly requires sophisticated hacking efforts.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2014.2299198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717039","Automatic exploit generation;bug forensics;software crash analysis;symbolic execution;taint analysis","Analytical models;Computer crashes;Concrete;Libraries;Registers;Security;Software","computer crime;program diagnostics;program testing;software fault tolerance;symbol manipulation","Microsoft office word;S<sup>2</sup>E;archiver;attack generation;automatic exploit generation;binary programs;concolic executions;end-to-end approach;format string;foxit;heap overflows;mapped symbolic memory;media player;mitigation-hardened exploits;mpalyer;pdf reader;pseudo symbolic variables;software crash analysis;software failures;software fuzz testing targets;sophisticated hacking efforts;stack overflows;symbolic failure model;symbolic pointers;unrar;word processor","","1","","30","","2014-01-20","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set).

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","30","1","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Concerning heavy tails in preprocessing, our study reveals that snort preprocessing times give rise to a cumulative distribution function which is extremely heavy-tailed. Concerning temporal correlations, our analysis reveals that payload processing times evolve in two time scales: a fast time scale and a slow time scale. The fast, packet-to-packet time scale corresponds to 40-100 contiguous packets (a packet group), within which the content matching times are independent. In the slow, packet group-to-packet group time scale the mean values of the successive packet groups are heavily correlated and can be predicted.

However, COTS middleware is generally too weak to handle intrusions (i.e., information attacks), thus making critical and commonly used information systems highly vulnerable. We evaluate the possible intrusion scenarios associated with today's commercial middleware platforms and discuss the possible impacts. We also describe our approach based on the concepts of fragmentation-redundancy-scattering (FRS) to provide intrusion tolerance to some of these intrusion threats and the utilities provided by the middleware to implement needed functionality. Finally, we set the stage for our current and future work for applying a broad variety of FRS algorithms to a broad spectrum of COTS middleware.","","0-7803-7400-2","","10.1109/ICC.2002.997034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=997034","","Business;Collaboration;Contracts;Information security;Information systems;Message-oriented middleware;Redundancy;Scattering;Web server;Web services","client-server systems;distributed object management;information systems;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","CORBA;COTS middleware;FRS algorithms;MOM;Web servers;commercial middleware platforms;commercial-off-the-shelf middleware;computer security;fragmentation-redundancy-scattering;information attacks;information systems;intrusion tolerance","","0","","13","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011","0-7695-2136-3","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","15","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions.

That is, if a firewall prevents outside IP addresses from sending packets to an internal protected machine that is only accessible on the local network, our technique can still find the machine. We employ a novel TCP/IP side channel technique to achieve this. The technique uses side channels in “zombie” machines to learn information about the network from the perspective of a zombie. Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans. This paper addresses two key questions about our technique: how many machines are there on the Internet that are hidden behind firewalls, and how common is ingress filtering that prevents our scan by not allowing spoofed IP packets into the network. We answer both of these questions, respectively, by finding 1,296 hidden machines and measuring that only 23.9% of our candidate zombie machines are on networks that perform ingress filtering.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218441","","IP networks;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Ports (Computers);Probes;Size measurement","IP networks;Internet;firewalls","IP addresses;IP identification;Internet measurement technique;TCP/IP side channel technique;firewalls;hidden machines;idle scans;original SYN;zombie machines","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, network devices, enterprise servers or personal computers are potential targets of these attacks. Current security solutions like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and virtual private networks (VPN) are centralized solutions which rely mostly on the analyze of inbound network connections. This approach notably forgets the effects of a rogue station, whose communications cannot be easily controlled unless the administrators establish a global authentication policy using methods like 802.1x to control all network communications among each device. To the best of our knowledge, a distributed and easily manageable solution for the global security of an enterprise network does not exist. In this paper, we present a new approach to deploy a distributed security solution where communication between each device can be control in a collaborative manner. Indeed, each device has its own security rules, who can be shared and improved through exchanges with others devices. With this new approach, called grid of security, a community of devices ensures that a device is trustworthy and that communications between devices progress in respect of the control of the system policies. To support this approach, we present a new communication model that helps structuring the distribution of security services among the devices. Like this, we can secure both ad-hoc, local-area or enterprise networks in a decentralized manner, preventing the risk of a security breach in the case of a failure.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318979","distributed communication;grid design;security architecture","Authentication;Collaboration;Communication system control;Communication system security;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Microcomputers;Network servers;Virtual private networks","grid computing;middleware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","authentication policy;distributed security solution;firewalls;grid of security;intrusion detection systems;network security;virtual private networks","","1","","17","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model.

Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules. Yet, one question has not been considered so far and that is nano communication security, i.e., will it be possible to protect such systems from manipulation by malicious parties? Our objective is to provide some first insights into the security challenges and to highlight some of the open research challenges in this field. The main observation is that especially for molecular communication existing security and cryptographic solutions might not be applicable.

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting.

This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers. Its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure. This paper offers a detailed dissection of the botnet's scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2297678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717049","Botnet;Internet background radiation;Internet telephony;Network Telescope;VoIP;communication system security;darknet;network probing;scanning","Animation;Geology;IP networks;Internet;Ports (Computers);Servers;Telescopes","IP networks;computer network security;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","IPv4 address space;SIP server;Sality botnet;UCSD Network Telescope;VoIP-related infrastructure;critical voice communications infrastructure;cyber-criminal activity;global Internet;horizontal scan;malware evolution;network scans;scanning strategy;stealth scanning strategies;traffic data;unsolicited traffic","","0","","68","","2014-01-20","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus, there is no guarantee that a routed communication path is free of malicious nodes that will not comply with the employed protocol and attempt to interfere the network operations. In this paper, we survey the problem of secure routing in ad hoc wireless networks, and discuss the related techniques of cryptographic key distribution. However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols. We therefore consider the problem of intrusion detection for such nodes. The intrusion detection problem and some solutions are described in detail for a concrete queueing model of medium access. The extensions of the solutions to address the problem in more general scenarios are also discussed.","","0-7803-8140-8","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290203","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer science;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;queueing theory;routing protocols;telecommunication security","compromised nodes;concrete queueing model;cryptographic key distribution;intrusion detection problem;medium access;secure routing protocols;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","26","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we use the ns-2 network simulator to demonstrate the vulnerability of the MintRoute protocol to link quality attacks by a malicious node. We then propose a novel ""sequence number gap trick"" as a lightweight means to test for and detect the presence of a malicious attacker.

With the power of massively parallel processing, the speedup of CPM is up to 128X as compared with serial Cuckoo implementation. Compared to other hardware systems, CPM is far better in performance and saves 30% of the area.","","978-0-7695-3978-2","978-1-4244-6026-7","10.1109/DELTA.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438688","Cuckoo Hashing;FPGA;Massively Parallel Processing;NIDS/NIPS;Pattern Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Cyclic redundancy check;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel architectures;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Throughput","cryptography;parallel processing;pattern matching","Cuckoo hashing;hardware-based multipattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network system intrusion prevention system;parallel Cuckoo pattern matching engine;parallel processing;static pattern set","","1","","12","","","13-15 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to keep the quiescent current low is to replace conventional electronic systems like an intrusion detection system by an energy autonomous one. The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient. Power consumption of the proposed wireless sensor network is computed and compared with other wireless networks employing different types of ALOHA MAC layer protocols for handling sporadic traffic without significant control overhead.","","978-1-4673-1590-6","978-1-4673-1589-0","10.1109/SSD.2012.6198098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198098","Wireless sensor networks;automotive;energy autonomous","Base stations;Glass;Media Access Protocol;Power demand;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automotive electronics;energy conservation;energy harvesting;mobile radio;power consumption;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","ALOHA;ASYMOF;MAC layer protocol;automobile safety system;built-in safety feature;electronic system;energy autonomous microsystems with mechanical energy harvester for mobile;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;network traffic handling;parking garage;power consumption;wireless energy autonomous sensor network","","0","","8","","","20-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, the network processor has become a promising solution for network devices due to its computation capability and programming flexibility. However, developing the network applications on network processors is not easy. How to efficiently program multiple processing elements and utilize various memory modules as well as the hardware resources on network processors are always challenges. In this paper, we investigate several optimization issues and programming techniques that should be considered by the developers to achieve higher packet processing rate on network processors. We use an existing packet classification scheme called hierarchical binary prefix search (HBPS) as the benchmark to test and evaluate these optimization techniques. The experiments conducted on Intel IXP2400 network processor show that the overall performance of HBPS can be improved about 42% while these techniques are adopted.","","978-1-4244-6969-7","978-1-4244-6970-3","10.1109/HPSR.2010.5580281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580281","Intel IXP2400;network processor;packet classification","","Internet;multi-threading;optimisation;packet switching","Intel IXP2400 network processor;Internet;hardware resource;hierarchical binary prefix search;memory module;multithreaded network processor;optimization technique;optimized packet processing;packet classification scheme;program multiple processing","","1","","13","","","13-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current software-based solutions, however, have difficulties dealing with a great number of flows in today's high-speed networks. This paper proposes RocketTC, a scalable FPGA-based architecture, to accelerate traffic classification while maintaining high accuracy. It combines two significant elements: (1) an efficient flow management scheme using on-chip BRAMs for storing the flow table, and (2) a parallel and pipelined classification engine array with partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) on FPGA. We have implemented and evaluated RocketTC on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform. Our results show a sustained throughput of over 20 Gbps for minimum packet size of 40 bytes, and high accuracy above 97% for classifying nearly a hundred popular applications.

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478","Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation","Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations","distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations","DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation","","0","","43","","2014-11-10","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm considers a metric based on the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR).

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues. We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that the resulting system outperforms a general-purpose operating system by an average of 22% for a real networking application. We also discuss tradeoffs that will need to be considered in further development of systems using this design.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579531","communications systems;networking;virtualization","Acceleration;Application software;Buildings;Cryptography;Hardware;Operating systems;Sockets;Software libraries;Virtual machining;XML","computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","ASIC;Symerton project;XML processing;network processors;operating systems;packet processing complexity;proof-of-concept implementation;service provider networks;virtual machine","","0","6","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273","Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis","","","","4","","26","","2012-05-15","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Not only it provides various services to users (e.g. calls, instant messaging, internet conferencing etc), but it is also in a process of extending services (e.g. fax service). Due to the open environment of packet switched network, the signaling protocols (such as SIP and H.323) and the transport protocols (e.g. RTP and SRTP) used by VoIP, it is prone to unwanted accesses and does not comply with the security standards. VoIP is also vulnerable to threats from TCP/IP and UDP. Furthermore, the malicious users can exhaust proxy and end users with INIVTE flooding in SIP. In order to overcome these challenging issues, we propose a simple and robust method to detect INVITE flooding on the SIP proxy server by a strategic proxy model that is based on a user-specified threshold. This model is based on the traffic pattern of normal VoIP traffic and the attacked traffic pattern. Unlike considering only stateful proxies, our model is works for both stateless and stateful proxies.","","978-1-4244-9539-9","","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982572","","Computer crime;Estimation;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers","IP networks;Internet telephony;packet switching;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","H.323;INIVTE flooding;SIP proxy server;SRTP;TCP/IP;UDP;VoIP technology;attacked traffic pattern;end users;flooding attack;malicious users;normal VoIP traffic;packet switched network;security standards;signaling protocols;stateful proxy;stateless proxy;strategic proxy model;strategy based proxy;transport protocols;unwanted accesses;user agent;user-specified threshold;voice over IP technology","","4","","18","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
