This paper presents a new concept termed “brink of failure” and demonstrates its relationship to network security. The paper describes an automated Brink of Failure (BOF) and Breach of Security (BOS) Detection and Recovery System that correlates network events to recognize and diagnose BOF conditions and their impact on the network's security posture and also suggests remedial actions.

Intrusion detection method is based on analysis of neighbor's behavior and thresholding technique, applied to selected parameters: the number of received packets in a time window of a given length and inter-arrival time of packets. It does not require installation of any additional hardware and extra communication costs; its computational requirements are negligible. The proposed technique ma be used in both hierarchical and flat WSNs. The paper contains recommendations to the choice of threshold value for each traffic parameter.

International Conference on","20070402","2006","","","1","6","HashMem is a memory based, exact pattern matching architecture for Snort-like intrusion detection. It uses CRC- style functions to determine a unique location for a possible match and then matches the input against the pattern stored in the specified memory location. This approach achieves is a very low logic and a reasonable memory cost. In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic. We also extend the V-HashMem architecture to include a header-ID field and support header matching information, a feature missing both from our own earlier work and many related systems.","","1-4244-0312-X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101006","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Scalability;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;memory architecture;pattern matching;security of data","CRC functions;FPGA;Snort-like intrusion detection;comparators;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;single memory structure;variable-length Hashmem architecture","","2","","16","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea is to use a two-phase hashing system and small memory units functioning in parallel to achieve a high-throughput and memory efficient behavioral analysis engine. The system performs behavioral analysis on selected information/user(s) and builds a bell-shaped curve for normal traffic using parallel counters.

In the proposed procedure a 2D mesh topology is selected first while PCA algorithm is represented in form of a task graph, which can be divided into 2 levels. In the higher level, tasks are matrix-based algorithms, such as mean computation, which in turn will be mapped onto the NoC topology. Since the NoC is scalable, an appropriate size of 2D mesh will be selected so that the timing of each task in the task chain is matched resulting in an effective pipeline in the higher level. The simulation using SystemC with NoC modeled as Cycle-Accurate showed that an average throughput of 2.20 Gbps and latency of 0.025 cycle/flit were achieved while computing the matrix multiplication of size 112×92 with 81 Processing Element (PE) organize as 9×9 while running with clock speed of 100 MHz.","","978-1-4673-1156-4","978-1-4673-1155-7","10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6381018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381018","2D Principal Component Analysis (2D-PCA);Homogeneous Processor;Networks-on-Chip (NoC);Parallel Matrix Multiplication;System-on-Chip (SoC);SystemC","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms","matrix multiplication;network-on-chip;principal component analysis;topology","2D mesh topology;NoC topology;PCA algorithm;SystemC;hardware implementation;matrix based algorithm;matrix manipulation;matrix multiplication;mean computation;networks on chip paradigm;principal component analysis;processing element;task chain;task graph","","0","","9","","","2-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457","Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system","Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines","QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor","","8","4","27","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations. The contribution of this work is the creation of a framework that allows administrators to identify potential workstations for forming ad-hoc computer clusters of their environment.","","978-1-4799-4556-6","","10.1109/I4CT.2014.6914181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914181","Distributed Systems;Resource Management;Resource Monitoring;Resource Prediction","Clouds;Distributed computing;Monitoring;Organizations;Prediction methods;Workstations","workstation clusters","ad-hoc computer clusters;time 42 day;turned-on patterns;workstations uptime analysis framework","","0","","27","","","2-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231","Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks","","35","","52","","2010-06-10","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades.

This paper presents an intelligent control system based on artificial immune system architecture to maintain the thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. Specifically, a residential building is regarded as a human body and a comfortable thermal environment means the healthy state of body. Whenever outside factors disturb this state, which is analogous to the intrusion of pathogens, the immune system will work automatically to eliminate them and therefore to keep the proper state of the body.

For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security. However, there is not an effective intrusion detection and self-recovery system to eliminate the harm of DoS attacks. To solve the problem, an agent-based intrusion detection and self-recovery system for WSNs is proposed, which adopts the distributed architecture to monitor intrusion activities and realize abnormal events processing in local nodes. Finally, the system is analyzed and verified. The simulation results indicate that the compromised nodes can self-recover effectively and network total energy consumption also is reduced effectively.","","","","10.1109/ICBNMT.2013.6823943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823943","DoS attacks;Intrusion detection;Sef-recovery;Wireless sensor networks","Computer crime;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;software agents;wireless sensor networks","agent based intrusion detection;denial of service attacks;network total energy consumption;self-recovery system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To satisfy the energy efficiency requirements, we propose three type Monitor Nodes (MNs) devices for different RPL applications. To explicitly show the design of IDSs, we apply our IDS to defense the type of RC intrusion in RPL using ETX metric on Contiki OS, and the results verify the effectiveness of our IDSs.

GIDTA allows the detection of distributed attacks at their early stages using the collection, correlation, and exchange of data provided by different network components and the structures available at the operating system level and the disk management level. In addition, major detection and tolerance capabilities are protected against intruders attempts since they are performed by compromise independent components. The GIDTA components implement different functions based on global and hierarchical models allowing flee grained distributed analysis, and including intelligent capabilities that are able to impose a dynamic behavior taking into consideration the security state of the cooperating entities. A protocol called a neighbor identification protocol is designed to enhance detection and tolerance capabilities. Finally, GIDTA is validated based on the actions it performs in an environment that integrates an airport distributed application, including a flight management system.","","978-1-4244-1129-0","","10.1109/CCST.2007.4373495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373495","IDS cooperation;Intrusion detection;Tolerance;correlation;storage-based intrusion detection","Airports;Communication networks;Environmental management;Independent component analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Management information systems;Operating systems;Protection;Protocols","protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","cooperating system;global intrusion detection;global intrusion tolerance;neighbor identification protocol","","0","","11","","","8-11 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An IP flow is a unidirectional series of IP packets of a given protocol, traveling between a source and destination, within a certain period of time. Based on ""flow"" concept, we developed a flow-based aggregation technique that dramatically reduces the amount of monitoring data and handles high amounts of statistics and packet data. FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as ""flow key"". FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow.

Despite numerous technological innovations for information assurance, it is still very difficult to protect computer systems. Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks. Experimental results show the achievement of acceptable detection rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusions, while no other complementary techniques or relevant heuristics are applied.","","0-7695-2294-7","","10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434896","Information assurance;genetic algorithms;misuse intrusion detection;software development;support-confidence","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;genetic algorithms;security of data;software engineering","Internet;genetic algorithms;information assurance;misuse intrusion detection;network audit data;network intrusion detection;security threat;software development;support-confidence framework","","14","","17","","","23-25 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a context of high traffic with heavy tailed characteristics, static rules for dispatching traffic slices among distributed sensors cause severe imbalance. Hence, the distributed NIDS architecture must be combined with adequate mechanisms for dynamic load redistribution. In this paper, we propose and compare different policies for the activation/deactivation of the dynamic load balancer. In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models. Our experimental results show that the best combination of a double threshold scheme with a linear aggregation of resource measures is able to achieve a really satisfactory balance of the sensor loads together with a sensible reduction of the number of load balancer activations.","","0-7695-2922-4","","10.1109/NCA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276617","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Dispatching;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Load management;Load modeling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dispatching traffic slices;distributed architectures;dynamic load balancing;dynamic load redistribution;multiple sensors;network intrusion detection systems","","4","","23","","","12-14 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our approach we consider that a nervous system design and organization is a constructive process carried out by genetic information encoded in DNA. Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones. Our method was initially tested on a simple, but non-trivial, XOR problem. We also submit our method to two other problems of increasing complexity: Prediction of the effect of a new drug on Breast Cancer and KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Some advantages of the proposed methodology are that it increases the level of implicit parallelism of the GA and seems to be capable of generating minimal satisfactory neural architectures, resulting in a reduction of project costs and increasing the performance of the evolved ANN, suggesting a promising potential for future applications.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280535","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Genomics;Legged locomotion;RNA","DNA;genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","ANN;DNA;KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset;L-system;Lindenmayer System;NEA;artificial neural networks;biologically inspired neuroevolutive algorithm;breast cancer drug;constructive process;evolutionary computation;evolutionary process;genetic algorithm;genetic information encoding;hierarchical neural structures;minimal satisfactory neural architectures;modular neural structures;nervous system design;neural codification;nontrivial XOR problem;project cost reduction;recurrent neural structures;recursive substructure composition","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we formulate the problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as ""predictive blacklisting"") based on shared attack logs, as an implicit recommendation system. We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for prediction and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement. Inspired by the recent NetFlix competition, we propose a multi-level collaborative filtering model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting problem. Our model captures and combines various factors namely: attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims interactions (using neighborhood models).

Our goal is to retrofit autonomic computing onto such systems, externally, without any need to understand or modify the code, and in many cases even when it is impossible to recompile. We present a meta-architecture implemented as active middleware infrastructure to explicitly add autonomic services via an attached feedback loop that provides continual monitoring and, as needed, reconfiguration and/or repair.

IEEE GLOBECOM 2008. IEEE","20081208","2008","","","1","5","Detecting spreaders can help an intrusion detection system identify potential attackers. The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181","","Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","SRAM chips;security of data","SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint","","0","","12","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, source images are decomposed in different scales and directions by NSCT, thus the low frequency subband coefficients and the high frequency subband coefficients are obtained. Secondly, for the low frequency subband coefficients, we present a fusion rule based on the local entropy; while for the high frequency subband coefficients, a fusion rule based on the directional contrast combined with the local area energy is applied.

To solve such a problem, a head cluster is elected by the nodes to handle the detection service. Current solution elects a leader randomly without considering the energy level of nodes. Such solution is vulnerable to selfish nodes that do not provide IDS service to others while at the same time benefiting from others' services. From our experiments, selfish nodes reduce the effectiveness of an IDS since less packets are inspected over time. Here, we are modeling a distributed, truthful, and efficient mechanism for electing a leader IDS that handles the detection process in a cluster. Our solution is able to balance the energy among all the nodes and increase the overall lifetime of an IDS in a cluster. In our model, incentives are given in the form of reputation to encourage the nodes to cooperate in the leader election process. The reputation is used to track the cooperative behavior of nodes where miss-behaving nodes are punished by withholding the cluster's services. Reputations are calculated based on the truth-telling mechanism design known as Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG). Our analysis prove that truth-telling is the dominant strategy for all the nodes and therefore efficiency is guaranteed. Finally, simulation results show that our mechanism improves the performance of an IDS in analyzing packets and punishes misbehaving nodes.","","978-0-7695-2889-2","","10.1109/WIMOB.2007.4390872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4390872","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Microeconomics;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile communication;telecommunication security","IDS election mechanism;MANET;intrusion detection system;leader election process;miss-behaving nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;reputations;selfish nodes;truth-telling mechanism design","","3","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE","20120510","2012","","","1987","1995","Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576","","Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers","Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols","Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression","","2","","25","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While techniques such as cryptographic methods, intrusion detection, and traditional fault tolerance are currently being used to improve the survivability of such systems, new approaches are needed to help reach the levels that will be required in the near future. This paper proposes the use of fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation as key enabling technologies in a new approach designed to achieve this goal. Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability. Dynamic adaptation allows survivable services to change their behavior at runtime as a reaction to anticipated or detected intrusions or failures. The Cactus system provides support for both fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation, thereby offering a potential solution for building survivable software in networked systems","","0-7695-0490-6","","10.1109/DISCEX.2000.825033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825033","","Accidents;Computer errors;Computer science;Cryptography;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Runtime;Safety;Web and internet services","security of data;software fault tolerance;system recovery","Cactus approach;adaptability;cryptographic methods;dynamic adaptation;fine-grain customization;intrusion detection;networked systems;performance;security;software diversity;software fault tolerance;software reliability;survivability;system failure","","11","","62","","","2000","25 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377216","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Filters;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data","anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques;false alarm rate;intrusion context identification;intrusive datasets;system calls trace;visualized anomalies","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical. How to avoid starving large flows while still giving higher priority to short flows is a dilemma we have to face in practice. In this paper, we propose a QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy (QTL), which can remedy LAS' defect. The experimental results show that our QTL scheduling policy has approximately the same performance as LAS for short flows, and meanwhile exhibits greatly enhanced processing capability for large flows.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546727","LAS;QoS-supported three-level scheduling (QTL);marked large flows;threat detection latency;threat loss rate","Inspection;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Scheduling;Time factors","Internet;quality of service;queueing theory;scheduling;security of data","Internet traffic;LAS;QTL;QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;network intrusion detection system;network security monitoring","","0","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The AIIDA-SQL agent incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) engine which is equipped with learning and adaptation capabilities for the classification of SQL queries and detection of malicious user requests. To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way. Finally, a projection neural technique is incorporated, which notably eases the revision stage carried out by human experts in the case of suspicious queries. The experimental results obtained on a real-traffic case study show that AIIDA-SQL performs remarkably well in practice.","","978-1-4244-7363-2","","10.1109/HIS.2010.5600026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600026","Agent;Artificial Neural Network;Case-Based Reasoning;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Book reviews;Classification algorithms;Cognition;Databases;Humans;Support vector machines","SQL;case-based reasoning;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","AIIDA-SQL agent;CBR engine;SQL injection attack detecting;SQL queries classification;adaptive intelligent intrusion detector agent;artificial neuronal network;case-based reasoning engine;information security;malicious user requests detection;projection neural technique;support vector machine;web applications","","1","","18","","","23-25 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the “bad guys” are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called “Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO” (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server. In this way we increase the dependability of the server and provide a new way to balance the trade-off between security and availability.

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient IDS by selecting relevant futures from NSL-KDD dataset and using Logistic Regression (LR) based classifier. To decrease memory space and learning time, a feature selection method is required. In this paper we have selected a number of feature sets, using the approach of Genetic Algorithm (GA), with our proposed fitness score based on Mutual Correlation. From the number of feature sets, we have selected the fittest set of features using our proposed Best Feature Set Selection (BFSS) method. After selecting the most relevant features from NSL-KDD data set, we used LR based classification. Thus, an efficient IDS is created by applying the concept of GA with BFSS for feature selection and LR for classification to detect network intrusions.","","978-1-4799-4446-0","","10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060117","BFSS;GA;Gradient Descent;IDS;LR;Mutual Correlation;NSL-KDD","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Sociology;Statistics;Training","feature selection;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;regression analysis;security of data","BFSS;GA;IDS;LR classifier;best feature set selection method;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system;logistic regression;mutual correlation","","0","","19","","","7-8 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with Regular Expression (RegEx) detection is the de facto defense mechanism agains network intrusions. However, current RegEx detection systems cannot keep up with the upcoming high-speed line rate. The RegExes consist of three types of components, exact strings, character classes (CC), and repetitions. Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection. Additionally, we propose a practical application of the Range Hash architecture where it can be used as a pre-filter for a Regular Expression detection system to increase overall RegEx detection performance.

Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm. We also compare these variations with one another to select the efficient algorithm. In most of the variations partitioning and hybrid methodologies are originated to deal DBSCAN problems.

The ubiquity of the Internet and the easy perpetration of attacks will lead to more hostile traffic. With the advent of high-speed Internet connections, organizations today find it difficult to detect intrusions. So multi sensor intrusion detection systems are inevitable. The optimum distribution of traffic to the sensors is a challenging task. We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced. This mechanism of policy-reloading also take into account the similarity between all possible pairs of policies and tries to minimize the packet duplication rate during the operation of the system. Our mechanism is based on the observation that minimizing the percentage of traffic being duplicated can enhance system performance. We also discuss the effects of the reloading of splitting policies on packet duplication rate and on the load on the sensors.","","0-7803-8325-7","","10.1109/INCC.2004.1366575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366575","","Adaptive systems;Educational institutions;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Scalability;Sensor systems;Statistics;System performance;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;SNORT intrusion detection system;adaptive load balancing architecture;load disparity;management console;multi sensor intrusion detection systems;packet duplication rate minimization;traffic splitting policies","","0","","8","","","11-13 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4","","10.1109/IPSN.2006.244130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host. In addition, we showed that MapReduce-based programs complete the flow analysis job against a single node failure.","","978-1-4244-6037-3","","10.1109/NOMSW.2010.5486551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486551","Hadoop;MapReduce;NetFlow;cloud computing;traffic monitoring","Cloud computing;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Statistical distributions;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;network servers;parallel processing;public domain software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Hadoop;Internet flow analysis method;Internet traffic measurement;MapReduce software framework;cloud computing platform;cluster filesystem;coarse traffic statistics;distributed parallel processing schemes;flow aggregation;flow statistics;flow traces;high performance server;open-source MapReduce system;packet sampling;packet traces;traffic data monitoring","","23","","15","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant. In this paper we provide an overview of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis techniques to discover these vulnerabilities. The paper reviews the security issues targeting web services, software/program verification and security development lifecycle.","","978-1-4799-1736-5","","10.1109/THS.2015.7225337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225337","Cyber Security;Penetration Testing;RESTFul API;SOA;SOAP;Secure Design;Secure Software Development;Security Code Review;Service Oriented Architecture;Source Code Analysis;Static Analysis Tool;Static Code Analysis;Web Application security;Web Services;Web Services Security","Computer crime;Cryptography;Simple object access protocol;Testing;XML","Web services;program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","Heartbleed;Internet of Things;Internet scale;OWASP;Open Web Application Security Project;RESTFul services;SOAP centric standards;Shellshock;WS-SecureConversation;WS-security;Web applications;Web service security;Web services guidelines;XML encryption;XML signature;critical national infrastructure;dynamic analysis;enterprise software ecosystem;information exchange;mission critical API;mobile applications;national security and industry;program verification;public deployments;public sector infrastructure;risk assessment;secure development life cycle;security challenges;service development paradigm;service-oriented architecture;services security;software bugs;software verification;static code analysis;strategic components;ubiquitous IoT;vulnerabilities detection;vulnerability identification","","0","","23","","","14-16 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this network, the sensors are associated with different groups, based on their functional types and after deployment they collaborate with one another in the same group for doing any assigned task for that particular group. We term this sort of DSN as a heterogeneous distributed sensor network (HDSN). Considering this scenario, we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator (OWA) which ensures that, before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other's legitimacy of membership. Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN. Our analysis shows that, the proposed scheme could work well in conjunction with other security mechanisms for sensor networks and is very effective to resist any adversary's attempt to be included in a legitimate group in the network.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455133","Group;One Way Accumulator;Security;Sensor","Computer networks;Data security;Electronic mail;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Object detection;Open wireless architecture;Surveillance;Target tracking;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This improves network visibility and control thereby reducing vendor dependency. OpenFlow protocol provides a standardized approach to realize these goals of SDN. In this paper, we illustrate our progress with a Software-defined Cloud-Gateway automation system using OpenFlow. In addition, based on our deployment experience, we highlight two technical challenges when using OpenFlow. First, with the standardization being an evolving effort, we highlight some of the programming challenges and missing features within the OpenFlow protocol. Secondly, existing OpenFlow-based network stack lacks some architectural components that reduces the level of flexibility we achieve when programming the network. Most SDN controllers expose limited abstractions to build network applications thereby primarily functioning as an OpenFlow driver. This imposes an application programmer to work with several OpenFlow primitives. To address this problem, we elaborate our current work in extending the SDN stack to improve our overall network programmability experience.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2013.6710582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710582","Cloud Networking;Network Programmability;OpenFlow;Service Provider;Software-defined Networks;VPN","Libraries;Logic gates;Programming;Quality of service;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;internetworking;protocols","OpenFlow driver;OpenFlow protocol;SDN controllers;network visibility;overall network programmability experience;software defined cloud-gateway automation system;software-defined networks;vendor dependency","","1","","27","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With booming number of intruders and hackers in todays vast and sophisticated computerized world, it is unceasingly challenging to identify unknown attacks in promising time with no false positive and no false negative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization. Experimental results are compared with respect to detection rate and detection time and found that TREE classification algorithms achieved superior results over other algorithms. The whole experiment is conducted by using KDD99 data set.","","978-1-4673-6822-3","","10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219853","Intrusion Detection Systems;Machine Learning Algorithms;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machines;Vegetation","computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis","Adaboost algorihm;IDS;J48 tree algorithm;KNN;PCA;SVM;hackers;higher dimension dataset;intruders;intrusion detection approach;intrusion detection system;k-nearest neighbors;lower dimension dataset;machine learning algorithms;naive Bayes probabilistic classifier;nearest neighbors generalized exemplars algorithm;network attacks;network packet header;principal component analysis;random forest tree classification algorithm;support vector machines;system resources;voting features interval classification algorithm","","0","","19","","","26-28 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, the operation of low power consumption is very important. In this paper, a firewall unit by wave-pipelined operations is described. The firewall unit is used for port filtering and power control of IDL (Intrusion Detection Logic) on H-HIPS.

Despite all the hype surrounding SDNs, exploiting its full potential is demanding. Security is still the key concern and is an equally striking challenge that reduces the growth of SDNs. Moreover, the deployment of novel entities and the introduction of several architectural components of SDNs pose new security threats and vulnerabilities. Besides, the landscape of digital threats and cyber-attacks is evolving tremendously, considering SDNs as a potential target to have even more devastating effects than using simple networks. Security is not considered as part of the initial SDN design; therefore, it must be raised on the agenda. This article discusses the state-of-the-art security solutions proposed to secure SDNs. We classify the security solutions in the literature by presenting a thematic taxonomy based on SDN layers/interfaces, security measures, simulation environments, and security objectives. Moreover, the article points out the possible attacks and threat vectors targeting different layers/interfaces of SDNs. The potential requirements and their key enablers for securing SDNs are also identified and presented. Also, the article gives great guidance for secure and dependable SDNs. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges of SDN security that may be deemed appropriate to be tackled by researchers and professionals in the future.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2015.7081073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081073","","Computer architecture;Control systems;Network security;Operating systems;Software radio;Telecommunication network management","computer network security;software defined networking","SDN security;cyber-attacks;digital threats;network management;network programmability;security threats;software defined networks;thematic taxonomy","","0","","","","","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Without proper security mechanisms, networks will be confined to limited, controlled environments, negating much of the promise they hold. The limited ability of individual sensor nodes to thwart failure or attack makes ensuring network availability more difficult. To identify denial-of-service vulnerabilities, the authors analyzed two effective sensor network protocols that did not initially consider security.
