Feature selection for classification is a very active research field in data mining Selecting only relevant features before classification reduces the workload of classifier using feature selection. Feature selection optimizes the classification performance. It finds only useful features and removes non- relevant features, and reduces the input dimensionality which simplifies the implementation of the classifier and speed up the processing rate. Researchers have introduced many feature selection algorithms with different selection criteria. However, it has been found that no single criterion is best for all applications. A hybrid approach for feature selection called based on genetic algorithms (GAs) that employs a target learning algorithm to evaluate features. The merits of this method includes t multiple feature selection criteria and find small subsets of features that perform well for the target algorithm.","","978-1-4799-6817-6","","10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7193259","Classification;Dimension Reduction;Feature Selection;Hybrid Approach","Cancer;Classification algorithms;Ferroelectric films;Integrated circuits;Principal component analysis;Random access memory;Support vector machines","feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;pattern classification","GA;classification approach;classification performance optimization;data mining;feature evaluation;feature selection approach;genetic algorithms;hybrid approach;input dimensionality reduction;medical applications;nonrelevant feature removal;processing rate;selection criteria;target learning algorithm;workload reduction","","0","","16","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented. NS-3 simulation platform has been used to carry out performance analysis of these hierarchical routing protocols. The performance analysis shows that the hierarchical routing protocols, TL-LEACH, 3L-LEACH and 4L-LEACH fare better than the LEACH protocol.","","978-1-4799-2571-1","","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779352","LEACH;WSN;energy efficiency;network lifetime","Monitoring;Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","NS-3;WSN;clock speed;computational power;energy efficiency;finite battery energy;load balancing;multilevel LEACH protocol model;network lifetime;routing protocol;sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","2","","17","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to dynamic nature and lack of centralized monitoring points, these networks are highly vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) provide audit and monitoring capabilities that offer the local security to a node and help to perceive the specific trust level of other nodes. We take benefit of the clustering concept in MANETs for the effective communication between nodes, where each cluster involves a number of member nodes and is managed by a cluster-head. It can be taken as an advantage in these battery and memory constrained networks for the purpose of intrusion detection, by separating tasks for the head and member nodes, at the same time providing opportunity for launching collaborative detection approach. The clustering schemes are generally used for the routing purposes to enhance the route efficiency. However, the effect of change of a cluster tends to change the route; thus degrades the performance. This paper presents a low-overhead clustering algorithm for the benefit of detecting intrusion rather than efficient routing. It also discusses the intrusion detection techniques with the help of this simplified clustering scheme.","","978-0-7803-9442-1","978-0-7803-9442-1","10.1109/SCONEST.2005.4382879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4382879","Ad hoc networks;clustering scheme;election process;intrusion detection","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Collaboration;Communication effectiveness;Communication system security;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;collaborative detection approach;emergency rescue services;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;overhead clustering algorithm;route efficiency;wireless networks","","2","","11","","","27-27 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems rely on monitoring and detection of intrusions, thus composing an additional line of defense. Several paradigms have been applied for implementing IDS. In this paper we propose a NIDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection and Support Vector Machines(SVM) for the detection component. SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence. We test our approach with the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can obtain better results than regular SVM or PSO-SVM.","","","","10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982526","Intrusion Detection;SVM and Bat Algorithm","Accuracy;Barium;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Support vector machines","feature selection;feedforward neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","Bat algorithm;NIDS model;NSL-KDD data;PSO-SVM;feature selection;feed forward neural network;intrusion detection systems;optimization;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","","0","","27","","","17-19 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"High performance string matching algorithm for a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS)","Weinsberg, Y.; Tzur-David, S.; Dolev, D.; Anker, T.","Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem","High Performance Switching and Routing, 2006 Workshop on","20061016","2006","","","7 pp.","","Intrusion detection systems (IDS) were developed to identify and report attacks in the late 1990s, as hacker attacks and network worms began to affect the Internet. Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. Furthermore, our system is fully compatible with Snort's rules syntax, which is the de facto standard for intrusion prevention systems","","0-7803-9569-7","","10.1109/HPSR.2006.1709697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709697","","Associative memory;Computer hacking;Delay;Heart;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Wire","content-addressable storage;security of data;string matching;telecommunication traffic","IDS;NIPS;Snort's rules syntax;TCAM;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;network intrusion prevention system;pattern-matching algorithm;string matching algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","16","4","18","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a reputation-based scheme for efficiently solving the problem. The proposed scheme use both self-observation and second-hand information to establish comprehensive reputation of a node. Nodes with bad comprehensive reputation will be excluded from the network. History reputation is also taken into account to providing indeliberate faults tolerance. Furthermore, we use fuzzy analysis to deal with the imprecision based on the fact that the cause of packet dropping can be heterogeneous and therefore improve the performance without imposing a high computational burden.","","978-1-4244-4754-1","978-1-4244-4738-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358211","ad hoc networks;packet dropping;reputations","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Fault tolerance;High performance computing;History;Mathematics;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Routing","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;fuzzy set theory;mobile radio","fault tolerance;fuzzy analysis;history reputation;malicious packet dropping;mobile ad hoc network;network performance;node misbehavior;reputation-based scheme","","1","","18","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an efficient GPU-based pattern matching algorithm by leveraging the computational power of GPUs to accelerate the pattern matching operations to increase the over-all processing throughput.

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions. Further, we have implemented a low-overhead TARF module in TinyOS; as demonstrated, this implementation can be incorporated into existing routing protocols with the least effort. Based on TARF, we also demonstrated a proof-of-concept mobile target detection application that functions well against an antidetection mechanism.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081880","Wireless sensor networks;routing protocols;security.","Base stations;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","RF-shielding network;Sybil attacks;TARF;TinyOS;WSN;cryptographic techniques;geographic information;multihop routing;proof-of-concept mobile target detection;replaying routing information;sinkhole attacks;synchronization;trust-aware routing framework;trust-aware routing protocols;wireless sensor networks;wormhole attacks","","14","","38","","2011-11-15","March-April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster.

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

The network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes) are designed to identify attacks against networks or a host that are invisible to firewalls, thus providing an additional layer of security. NIDSes detect and filter the malicious packets by inspecting packet payloads to find worm signatures. The payload inspection operation dominates the throughput of an NIDS since every byte of packet payload needs to be examined. At network speeds of 1 Gbps or above, it can be difficult to keep up with intrusion detection in software, and hardware systems or software with hardware assist are normally required. This paper presents FTSE, a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) based pattern matching engine. In this paper we show how FTSE can be used effectively to perform string matching for thousands of strings at multiple-Gigabit speed. We also describe how FTSE can be implemented feasibly with an FPGA/ASIC, a 2.25 Mb TCAM, and a small SSRAM.

The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current.

These rules group into group-rule and common-rule generated by simplification. The intrusion detection is separated into common detection and extended detection step. The packet is checked by common detection using the common-rule. If this step detects nothing, the packet is forwarded to its destination. If not, it is passed into the extended detection using the group-rule. Through grouping of similar detection rules, the search space and searching time can be greatly minimized. Using the simplified rule in intrusion detection, the packet inspection time can be largely reduced. With the help of these two steps, fast and effective intrusion detection is possible in network nodes such as router and switch","","","","10.1109/ICACT.2005.245838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461781","","Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Switches","telecommunication networks;telecommunication security","common detection;common-rule;extended detection;group-rule;intrusion detection rule grouping;intrusion detection rule simplification;kernel-level intrusion detection method","","0","","9","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module. We have tested the system in a real environment where it has shown good capability in detecting attacks. In addition, the system has been tested using DARPA 1998 dataset with 100% recognition rate. In fact, our system can recognize attacks in a constant time.","","978-1-4799-3022-7","","10.1109/IACS.2014.6841978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841978","Host sweep;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network probe attack;Port scan;TDNN neural network","IP networks;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;neural nets;pattern classification","HIDS;NIDS;TDNN neural network structure;alert module;attack behavior classification;computer security systems;host sweep attacks;host-based intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection system;network probe attacks;packet capture engine;pattern classification;pattern recognition;port scan attacks;preprocessor;reconnaissance attacks;unauthorized accesses","","0","","26","","","1-3 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways. First of all, it provides a sophisticated language to describe multistep attacks in terms of states and transitions. In addition, the modular nature of the system supports the integrated analysis of network traffic sent to the server host, operating system-level audit data produced by the server host, and the access logs produced by the Web server. By correlating different streams of events, it is possible to achieve more effective detection of Web-based attacks.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254308","","Application software;Computer hacking;Computer science;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;Web sites;computer crime;file servers","Web-based applications;Web-based attacks;WebSTAT intrusion detection system;World-Wide Web servers;operating system-level audit data;server host;sophisticated attack languages","","26","2","25","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a kernel level authentication prototype to verify the originality of each suspicious process during runtime. The verification and authentication tasks are performed well in advance before each suspicious process getting the kernel service. We designed, implemented, and assessed the prototype in Windows.

However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day.

The experiment results prove that the multi-Agent system running in LAN can audit part of the intrusion effectively and improve log data analysis intelligence.","","978-1-4244-6356-5","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607423","","Algorithm design and analysis;Detection algorithms;Entropy;IP networks;Information entropy;Local area networks;Security","computer network security;entropy;local area networks;multi-agent systems","DDoS attack;companies;firewall;government departments;information entropy;intrusion detection systems;local area network;multiagent network security audit system;security problem","","0","","10","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transport scrubber's role is to convert ambiguous network flows into well-behaved flows that are unequivocally interpreted by all downstream endpoints. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP/IP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks-attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection-on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance.

These packet inspections typically require considerable delay often consuming more than 70% of the IDS processing time. Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922","Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber","Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design","","","","2","","14","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without proper security measures, an enemy can launch various kinds of attacks in hostile environments. These attacks can disrupt the normal working of WSNs and can defeat the purpose of their deployment. Therefore security is an important aspect of these networks. Preventive mechanisms can be applied to protect WSNs against some types of attacks. However, there are some attacks for which there are no known prevention methods.

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a program semantics-aware intrusion detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks. Experiments on a fully working Paid prototype show that Paid can indeed stop attacks that exploit non-standard security holes, such as format string attacks that modify function pointers, and that the run-time latency and throughput penalty of Paid are under 11.66% and 10.44%, respectively, for a set of production-mode network server applications including Apache, Sendmail, Ftp daemon, etc","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605766","","Automatic control;Computer security;Control systems;Delay;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Runtime;Throughput","Internet;security of data;source coding;telecommunication security","accurate application-specific sandboxing policy;cybersecurity threats;hijacking attacks;production-mode network server;program semantics-aware intrusion detection system;source code;system call monitoring","","0","","24","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this way, the IDS itself will depress overall performance and cannot be guaranteed secure. In this paper, we present an embedded architecture of SPMOS-based IDS. SPMOS, located in SPM, is a little OS running under GPOS. Experiment results show that the architecture is fast. Based on this, we also design a simple IDS and conduct tests by integrating it into SPMOS and GPOS.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

This can be used to verify the result of the intrusion attempt. We then extend this method to verify the result of attacks that still generate valid protocol status code in the server responses.

However, IDS must be distributed to work in a grid computing environment. It must monitor each node and, when an attack occurs, alert other nodes in the environment. This kind of communication requires compatibility between heterogeneous hosts, various communication mechanisms, and permission control over system maintenance and updates.

Advanced multi-core architectures like the IBM Cell Broadband Engine promise unprecedented performance at a low cost, thanks to their popularity and production volume. Nevertheless, the suitability of the cell processor to string matching has not been investigated so far. In this paper we investigate the performance attainable by the cell processor when employed for string matching algorithms based on deterministic finite-state automata (DFA).

In iOSDC, every OSD is intelligent, called intelligent OSD (iOSD) and all the objects are intelligent, called intelligent OBJECT (iOBJECT). Methods, rules, trigger and feed back mechanism are introduced into object defined in OSD-2 draft, so an object is comprised of data, attributes, methods, rules, trigger and feedback mechanism. After the relationship among these six components is built up, the object is no longer passive, but active.

"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on","20090127","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

As a smart spectrum sharing technology, cognitive radio can change its transmitter parameter based on interactive the environment where it operates. So the MAC address can be easy spoofed in the open air. An attacker can exploit this character to preempt spectrum resources and bring the negative impact to the network. In this paper, we propose a scheme of detecting identity-spoof attack based on Back Propagation (BP) network. The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS). The extracted Eigen values can be used as the input vectors of the BP neural network which are trained by the honest users' RSS. The honest users and the attackers can be divided into two categories by the trained BP network to detect an identity-spoof attack. Simulation result shows that our scheme can effectively detect identity-spoof attack with a low false alarm rate and miss alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-9792-8","","10.1109/CSQRWC.2011.6037280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6037280","BP neural network;cognitive radio network;identity-spoof attack detection","Jamming","access protocols;backpropagation;cognitive radio;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature extraction;neural nets;spectral analysis;telecommunication security","BP network;MAC address;backpropagation network;cognitive radio network;cognitive user;cognitive user opportunistic access;eigen value extraction;fingerprint feature extraction;identity spoof attack detection;miss alarm rate;parameter transmitter;received signal strength;smart spectrum sharing technology;spectrum resource;spectrum utilization","","1","","11","","","26-30 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper. The feasibility of the newly proposed paradigm is also partially demonstrated through application examples.","1098-7576","978-1-4244-1379-9","978-1-4244-1380-5","10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4371159","","Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Engines;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Immune system;Maintenance;Production;System testing;Vehicles","automotive components;automotive electronics;fault diagnosis;internal combustion engines","anomaly detection;automobiles;automotive diagnosis;diagnostic strategy;engines;fault diagnosis;immune systems inspired approach","","0","","38","","","12-17 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed.

Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a new bio-inspired model which is applied for solving various problems in the field of information security. The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response. The fundamental design of our proposed AIS based IDS consists of 2 main components: IDS central engine and detection sensors. Each of these components is composed of some agents which correlate with each other in order to detect the anomalies and intrusions. Our design goal is to decrease the detection time for each connection by distributing the detectors to each host.","","978-1-4244-8599-4","978-89-88678-32-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5713478","AIS;Agent;Danger Theory;Distributed;IDS","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Engines;Intrusion detection;Training","artificial immune systems;computer network security;distributed processing;genetic algorithms","AIS;IDS;anomalies detection;artificial immune system;bio-inspired model;distributed model;genetic algorithm;information security;intrusion detection system;network security","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, many real-world scenarios require a classification decision well before a flow has finished even if the flow's beginning is lost. This implies classification must be achieved using statistics derived from the most recent N packets taken at any arbitrary point in a flow's lifetime. We propose training the classifier on a combination of short sub-flows (extracted from full-flow examples of the target application's traffic). We demonstrate this optimisation using the naive Bayes ML algorithm, and show that our approach results in excellent performance even when classification is initiated mid-way through a flow with windows as small as 25 packets long.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After that two intrusion detection techniques for mobile ad-hoc networks, which use collaborative efforts of nodes in a neighborhood to detect a malicious node in that neighborhood are explained. The first technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood is within radio range of each other. The second technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes, in which each pair of nodes may not be in radio range of each other but where there is a node among them which has all the other nodes in its one-hop vicinity. Both techniques use message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes. Defect of these techniques is the impossibility of detecting wormhole attack in the form of out of band attack so in this paper we complete these techniques to give the ability of detecting wormhole attack and isolating them from routing process.","","978-1-61284-295-0","","10.1109/ICRIIS.2011.6125695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125695","Cluster;Monitor node;Wormhole attack;clique;insert Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET)","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Routing protocols","message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;collaborative techniques;intrusion detection;malicious node detection;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;one-hop vicinity;radio range;routing process;suspected nodes;wormhole attack detection","","1","","20","","","23-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Vulnerability assessment through mobile agents","Mallah, G.A.; Shaikh, Z.A.","","E-Tech 2004","20041115","2004","","","92","96","Vulnerability assessment is the process of measuring and prioritizing the risks associated with network- and host based systems to allow balance planning of technologies and activities that manage business risk. That is useful for adapting security policy, analysis of vulnerabilities, and creation of reports that effectively communicate security vulnerability discoveries and detailed corrective actions to all levels of an organization. While vulnerability assessment is not a new technology, mobile agents offer many advantages to the traditional implementations. The most significant contribution is the increased ability for system administrators to quickly and easily add distributed components to existing systems that can look for newly published vulnerabilities. This paper suggests the vulnerability assessment through mobile agents where both network and host-based technologies in coordinated fashion using mobile agents will provide the best vulnerability assessment for measuring an organization's security risks. The mobile agent targets the intended host or network, captures, analyzes, and scans all vulnerabilities and reports to the master agent/server for comprehensive analysis and security assessment, and the master agent will act accordingly. The paper also addresses advantages and issues regarding its implementation.","","0-7803-8655-8","","10.1109/ETECH.2004.1353850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353850","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Process planning;Risk management;Technology planning;Telecommunication traffic","computer network reliability;mobile agents;risk analysis;security of data;telecommunication security","balance planning;business risk;corrective actions;distributed system components;host based systems;master agent;mobile agents;network- based systems;risk assessment;security risks;security vulnerability discoveries;system administrators;vulnerability assessment;vulnerability capture","","2","2","10","","","31 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
