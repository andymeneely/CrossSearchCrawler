However, the high data rate coupled with complex detection can cause the capacity of the fault tolerance system to be exhausted resulting in low detection accuracy. We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection. We apply the approach to a reliable multicast protocol (TRAM) and demonstrate its performance by comparing it with our previous framework.","1060-9857","0-7695-2995-X","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365703","","Application software;Computer errors;Costs;Distributed computing;Electric breakdown;Fault detection;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Sampling methods;Throughput","computer network reliability;electronic messaging;error detection;fault tolerant computing;multicast protocols;sampling methods;telecommunication security","anomaly-based rule;fault tolerance system;high throughput distributed system;message exchange;reliable multicast protocol;sampling approach;stateful error detection","","2","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security measures, such as authentication and encryption, can be used for reducing the possibilities of attacks. But they are far from sufficiency. Intrusion detection is the second mechanism to detect the attacks. Anomaly IDS can be used to detect the abnormal behaviors of the network to find some unknown attacking patterns. This paper proposed an anomaly detection method using a simple Hide Markov Model to detect the abnormal network behaviors. We build a Hide Markov Model by supposing that all the network behaviors are completely normal. If observation sequence does not match the model, we conclude that the behavior is not normal, that is to say, there is an attack.","","978-1-4244-3708-5","978-1-4244-3709-2","10.1109/WICOM.2010.5601345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601345","","Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio","MANET;anomaly detection system;hide Markov model;intrusion detection","","0","","6","","","23-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software applications frequently fail to identify so many signatures through comparisons at very high network speeds. Bloom filters are one of the main multi-hashing schemes utilized in hardware to support this level of security. Nevertheless Bloom filters consume significant power to store, retrieve and lookup virus signatures owing to many hash function computations required to index to the memory. We present a novel lookup technique and architecture to decrease the power consumption of multi-hashing schemes, predominantly Bloom filters, in hardware. The theoretical analysis has shown that power gain achieved through new lookup technique can go up to 90%. Simulation results with three different classes of the hash functions embedded into the Bloom filter have indicated that power consumption of the Bloom filters can be considerably decreased by employing the low power lookup technique","","0-7695-2533-4","","10.1109/ISVLSI.2006.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1602437","","Application software;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Power filters","computer networks;cryptography;digital filters;low-power electronics;table lookup;telecommunication security","Bloom filters;hash functions;low power lookup technique;multihashing network;multihashing schemes","","4","","10","","","2-3 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A host of security issues need to be addressed for such interactive grids to gain acceptance, particularly in industry. The purpose of this paper is to study these security issues. The grid security infrastructure (GSI), a component of the Globus Toolkit (I. Foster et al., 1997), creates grid credentials for every user and resource. We describe how this may be extended to securely set up an interactive session on a remote host, and the additional security issues associated with interactive session management. We propose controlled shell and controlled desktop mechanisms that restrict the user to execute only authorized commands and applications, and controlled user and super-user accounts that customize the shell and desktop using policy files.

The intrusion detection model needs to be continuously tuned in order to reduce correlative alerts and help the administrator to determine accurate and critical attacks. In this work, an alert correlation detection module is proposed to analyze the alerts produced by IDSs and provides a more succinct and overall view of intrusions.

This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks. It provides mechanisms allowing a management station to delegate security-related tasks to mid-level managers (MLMs) that, in turn, interact with monitoring and action agents to execute these tasks. Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks). The platform also provides notification mechanisms (traps) so that MLMs can report the occurrence of major events to the management station.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514526","Computer network management;computer network security;site security monitoring","Automation;Computerized monitoring;Engineering management;IP networks;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Java;Protocols;Specification languages","Internet;Java;authorisation;business communication;computer network management;digital signatures;program verification;software agents;specification languages;system monitoring;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ID-trace management platform;IDS system;IETF;Internet engineering task force;MLM;SNMP-based platform;action agent;distributed stateful intrusion detection;enterprise network;known attack signature;mid-level manager;notification mechanism;program monitoring agent;protocol trace specification language;script MIB;script management information base;simple network management protocol;site security monitoring;sniff packet;time-consuming configuration","","6","","19","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers. In this paper, we describe how the integrated architecture of NPU and TCAMs can be exploited to develop high-speed solutions for heavy distinct hitters.","1063-6927","0-7695-2837-3","0-7695-2837-3","10.1109/ICDCS.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268163","","Associative memory;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Data security;Hardware;Sampling methods;Stock markets","content-addressable storage;invasive software;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","associative memory;attack detection;data streams;distributed denial of service attack;heavy distinct hitter;network packet;network processing unit;network router;security attack;ternary content addressable memory;worm attack","","2","","18","","","25-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681","978-1-4673-5956-6","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","3","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.","0730-3157","978-1-4244-7512-4","978-0-7695-4085-6","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339","autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability","SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability","","0","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS","","0-7695-2549-0","","10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271","IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network","","3","","16","","","29-29 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this new paradigm of data access, comes the threat of this information being exposed to unauthorized and unintended users. Many systems have been developed which scrutinize the data for a deviation from the normal behavior of a user or system, or search for a known signature within the data. These systems are termed as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Intrusion Detection is the process of monitoring and identifying attempted unauthorized systems access or manipulation. Successful High Performance Computing (HPC) requires a combination of technical innovation as well as political and operational experience to balance out the many (sometimes contradictory) pressures encountered in this field. This is particularly true with respect to operational field. In this paper we try to summarize the various types of Intrusion detection systems available and explain some key points for each particular type of IDS available in the market today and also insight IDS on High Performance Computing (HPC) environment.","","978-1-4799-5957-0","","10.1109/ICHPCA.2014.7045369","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045369","HIDS;High Performance Computing;Hybrid IDS;Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion Prevention;NIDS","Abstracts;Computer hacking;Correlation;Internet;Intrusion detection;Reliability;Technological innovation","authorisation;parallel processing","HPC environment;IDS;data access paradigm;high performance computing environment;intrusion detection systems;technical innovation;unauthorized system access;unauthorized users;unintended users","","0","","14","","","22-24 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the surface, this should greatly reduce the chances of successfully executing the type of coordinated and distributed cyber attacks necessary to cause large-scale failures. However, existing communications security schemes in power control systems only consider explicit communications. In this paper, we show that there is a rich set of covert communication channels available to attackers for use in coordinating large scale attacks against power grids. Specifically, we present PhyCo, a novel covert channel that leverages physical substrates, e.g., line loads, within a power system, to transmit information between compromised device controllers. Using PhyCo, two compromised controllers that are miles apart can coordinate their efforts by manipulating relays to modify the power network's topology. This can be done without requiring the use of any explicit communication channels, e.g., power line communications, and can evade intrusion detection sensors aimed at overt traffic. We have evaluated PhyCo using real-world programmable logic controllers on a realistic simulated power grid. Our results show that PhyCo can bypass existing intrusion detection sensors as well as physical inspections by carefully crafting covert communications to have minimal exterior consequences within normal operating thresholds.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007771","","Equations;Mathematical model;Power grids;Power measurement;Receivers;Sensors","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;programmable controllers","PhyCo;coordinated cyber attacks;covert channel communication;cyberphysical infrastructures;device controller;distributed cyber attacks;electric power systems;physical interdependencies;power grid;power network topology;programmable logic controller","","0","","24","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations.

We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces.

In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor). The proposed covert channel, for which we coin the term OverCovert, is based on the common return-to-libc stack-overflow attack and the address space layout randomization defense.

In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","978-0-7695-3495-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","3","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Song, Sui; Manikopoulos, C.N.","","Information Assurance Workshop, 2006 IEEE","20060710","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack. Furthermore, the approach includes reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160207","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Base stations;Computer science;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Watermarking;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SFD;WSN;data transmission;security attacks;selective forwarding detection;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we introduce an anomaly intrusion detection system, built on the notion of a DNA sequence or gene, which is responsible for the normal network traffic patterns. Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the “normal behavior DNA sequence” through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed. Finally, we provide the details of our FPGA implementation of the bioinformatics-based string matching technique. The associative string processor (ASP) is an associative memory-based micro-architecture with long fixed-length words that can be partially searched. We show that the proposed micro-architecture can handle fixed-length patterns at a rate of more than one character per cycle.","","978-1-4244-7716-6","","10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5586949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5586949","CAM;DNA computing;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection;anomaly identification;bioinformatics;pattern matching","Artificial neural networks;DNA","biocomputing;computer network security;content-addressable storage;field programmable gate arrays;string matching","DNA based anomaly identification system;DNA pattern matching;DNA sequence;FPGA implementation;anomaly intrusion detection system;associative memory based microarchitecture;associative string processor;bioinformatics;genetic material;network traffic patterns;string matching","","0","","15","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing. Each of these is a fundamental operation with easily understood formal properties, yet maps cleanly and efficiently to a wide variety of reconfigurable devices.

Compared with the traditional methods, the model designed here, which is totally insensitive to port numbers and contents of payload on application level, overcomes difficulty in operation caused by unreliable port numbers and complexity of payload interpretation. Rather than relatively complex ML algorithms or even in mixture, supervised k-Nearest Neighbor estimator is adopted for the sake of computational efficiency, along with the effective and easy-to-calculate statistical features selected according to the operational background.

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps.

A traditional packet-based Network IDS (NIDS) is time-intensive as it inspects all packets. A flow-based anomaly detector addresses scalability issues by monitoring only packet headers. This method is capable of detecting unknown attacks in high speed networks. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed in this research to detect anomalies in flow-based traffic. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms have the potential to achieve global optimal solution. In this paper, two metaheuristic algorithms, Cuckoo and PSOGSA, are examined to optimize the interconnection weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This optimized MLP is evaluated with two different flow-based data sets. We then compare the performance of these algorithms. The results show that Cuckoo and PSOGSA algorithms enable high accuracy in classifying benign and malicious flows.

The AMCS algorithm uses an improved representation for antigens (corresponding to network access patterns) and detectors (corresponding to detection rules). In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost. Our results indicate that breaking the bottleneck of immune-inspired network IDS through adjusting basic elements is feasible and effective.","1548-615X","978-1-4244-5987-2","","10.1109/IWQoS.2010.5542731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542731","artificial immune system;avidity model;clonal selection;gene expression programming;network intrusion detection","Artificial immune systems;Computer crime;Computer science;Detectors;Educational institutions;Gene expression;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","artificial immune systems;computer network security;genetic algorithms;performance evaluation","AIS;AMCS algorithm;DoS attack;GEP;antigens;artificial immune system;avidity-model based clonal selection algorithm;bio-inspired technique;core element;detector representation;false alarm rate;gene expression programming;immune-inspired network IDS;immune-inspired network intrusion detection system;immunology;lower detectors generation cost;network access patterns;performance evaluation","","0","","20","","","16-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, new network applications demanding multimatch classification - that is, requiring all matching results instead of only the highest-priority match - are emerging. Ternary content-addressable memory is becoming a common extension to network processors, and its capability and speed make it attractive for high-speed networks. The proposed TCAM-based scheme produces multimatch classification results with about 10 times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, their scheme for removing negation in rule sets saves up to 95 percent of the TCAM space used by a straightforward implementation.","0272-1732","","","10.1109/MM.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411716","","Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network address translation;Payloads;Probes;Protocols","content-addressable storage;packet switching;workstation clusters","high-speed networks;memory lookup;multimatch packet classification;network processors;ternary content-addressable memory","","21","","21","","","Jan.-Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Bitmap Algorithms for Counting Active Flows on High-Speed Links","Estan, C.; Varghese, G.; Fisk, M.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Wisconsin Univ., Madison, WI","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on","20061016","2006","14","5","925","937","This paper presents a family of bitmap algorithms that address the problem of counting the number of distinct header patterns (flows) seen on a high-speed link. Such counting can be used to detect DoS attacks and port scans and to solve measurement problems. Counting is especially hard when processing must be done within a packet arrival time (8 ns at OC-768 speeds) and, hence, may perform only a small number of accesses to limited, fast memory. A naive solution that maintains a hash table requires several megabytes because the number of flows can be above a million. By contrast, our new probabilistic algorithms use little memory and are fast. The reduction in memory is particularly important for applications that run multiple concurrent counting instances. For example, we replaced the port-scan detection component of the popular intrusion detection system Snort with one of our new algorithms. This reduced memory usage on a ten minute trace from 50 to 5.6 MB while maintaining a 99.77% probability of alarming on a scan within 6 s of when the large-memory algorithm would. The best known prior algorithm (probabilistic counting) takes four times more memory on port scan detection and eight times more on a measurement application. This is possible because our algorithms can be customized to take advantage of special features such as a large number of instances that have very small counts or prior knowledge of the likely range of the count","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2006.882836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709947","Counting distinct elements;traffic measurements","Computer crime;Computer science;Counting circuits;Hardware;Intrusion detection;NIST;Quality of service;Random access memory;Registers;Spine","Internet;probability;telecommunication links;telecommunication security","DoS attacks;Internet links;bitmap algorithms;high-speed links;intrusion detection system;packet arrival time;port-scan detection component;probabilistic algorithms;probabilistic counting","","31","","22","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

If there is no appropriate control on the information asset, information can be easily altered or deleted and even important information may be disclosed thereby generating serious loss. As the business of the finance industry includes the personal and transaction information of customer, therefore the requirement on information security has to be more stringent than other industry. Moreover, for the consideration on information security, generally this is conducted based on the angle of technology, but other factors are ignored. In fact, information security has three aspects including technology, management and policy.

Attacker usually upgrades itself to root privilege in vicious way using declared or covert holes on the compromised system. In this paper, we proposed a method to detect and resist vicious privilege upgrade based on integrity checking of trusted computing. At first, we calculated the secure hash values of the special executable code which upgrade privilege in legal way at relative safe status, and stored them in trusted platform model (TPM). Secondly, we embedded the anti-attack module in the scheduler of OS and kept pace with the scheduler. Once having detected privilege upgrade, we checked the integrity of current executable code with the pre-calculated secure hash values stored in TPM. Comparison mismatch explicated that object system was under attack. Object system terminated the current executable code immediately to resist vicious privilege upgrade. We realized this method based on Linux system and suggested an enhanced Linux kernel (ELK). Experiment result showed that this method can tolerate the existence of holes to a certain degree and safeguard system security from vicious privilege upgrade with acceptable cost.","","978-1-4244-5272-9","","10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374771","","Computer bugs;Computer science;Kernel;Law;Legal factors;Linux;Operating systems;Processor scheduling;Resists;Security","Linux;security of data","OS scheduler;antiattack module;enhanced Linux kernel;integrity checking;object system;operating system;system security;trusted computing;trusted platform model;vicious privilege upgrade detection method","","0","","10","","","18-20 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main security concern for e-business is Web application security. Web applications have many vulnerabilities such as Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, and Cross-site scripting (XSS). Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any research that summarizes the influent factors of detection web attacks. In this paper, the author studies state-of-the-art techniques and research related to web attack detection: the author analyses and compares different methods of web attack detections and summarizes the most important factors for Web attack detection independent of the type of vulnerabilities.

It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study. Our successful experience confirms that the platform can greatly facilitate the development of security solutions on MANET.","","0-7695-2369-2","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607590","","Atomic layer deposition;Automatic testing;Emulation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;System testing;Wireless networks","","","","2","","16","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an alternative hybrid-NIDS that couples an FPGA with a network adapter to provide hardware support for pattern matching and software support for post processing. The proposed system, SFAOENIDS, offers an extensible open-source NIDS for Solarflare AOE devices. The pattern matching engine-the primary component of the hardware architecture was designed based on the requirements of typical NIDS implementations.
