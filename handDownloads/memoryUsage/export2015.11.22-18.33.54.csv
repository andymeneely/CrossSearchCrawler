Such attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software to override its program control-flow and consequently invoke system calls, causing out-of-process damage. Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process. We implemented e-NeXSh as a set of modifications to the Linux-2.4.18-3 kernel and a new user-space shared library (e-NeXSh.so). The technique is transparent, requiring no modifications to existing libraries or applications. e-NeXSh was able to successfully defeat both code-injection and LIBC-based attacks in our effectiveness tests.

Regular expression matching is achieved by NFA and DFA. DFA is suitable for high-speed IDS due to its efficiency. However, the combined compilation of multiple rules containing “.*” may blow up in state and storage space. In this paper, we give an explanation to this problem from the prospective of information theory, and propose a multidimensional mathematical model focusing on the most serious state explosion. We divide redundant states into zero-dimensional ones and one-dimensional ones. The former are compressed by dimension, and the later are dynamically built. Theory proof illustrates that the space complexity of the model reaches the theoretical lower bound. Then we propose the multi-dimensional finite automata (MFA) based on the model. Experimental results show that, MFA reduces greatly the construction time, memory and matching time, compared with several typical state-of-the-arts DFA improved algorithms.","","","","10.1109/HPSR.2014.6900887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900887","DFA DPI;IDS;regular expression;state explosion","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Complexity theory;Explosions;Mathematical model;Redundancy;Security","computational complexity;computer network security;finite automata;pattern matching","DFA;MFA;NFA;high-speed IDS;information theory;lower bound;multidimensional finite automata;multidimensional mathematical model;network security;one-dimensional state explosion;regular expression matching algorithm;space complexity;state space;storage space;zero-dimensional state explosion","","0","","22","","","1-4 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security mechanisms can depend on the hardware that is available and can be changed over time. Offering a system that can cope with such change without the need of major re-engineering is a major challenge. Moreover, not at all time the same security level has to be maintained. A system that can adapt its security mechanisms to the actual threat level can deliver better performance.

Block tapping monitors the block-level data streams transparently through block-to-file semantic-translation at the virtual block device layer. Based on the self-described information of virtual storages, Block Tapping detects the file-level malicious behaviors independent of the internal state of the compromised virtual machine.

One compelling example, proposed in this paper, is the case of whitelists for DDoS mitigation, where domains broadcast, for each possible DDoS target (!), the set of legitimate customers (client IP addresses) whose traffic should not be blocked while a DDoS attack is in progress. However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers. In a previous work, we proposed a cryptographic approach called “conditional data sharing”, devised to permit disclosure of cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets of network monitoring data, only when a threshold number of domains are ready to reveal their data. In this paper, we cast such technique to a realistic scenario of whitelist sharing for DDoS mitigation, and we significantly extend the underlying cryptographic approach so as to support disclosure not only for threshold-based policies, but for more general (monotone) access structures.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824986","","Access control;Computer crime;Conferences;Cryptography;IP networks;Monitoring","computer network security;cryptography","DDoS mitigation;Internet-scale attacks;client IP addresses;competitor domains;conditional data sharing;cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets;cryptographic approach;defensive techniques;domains broadcast;legitimate customers;network monitoring data;network security data sharing;privacy concerns;threshold-based policies;whitelist sharing","","0","","39","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7","978-1-4244-0003-4","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The security of data transfer via WSN is a challenging issue, especially with the existence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, experimental analysis of the impact of existing DoS attacks on the performance of LEACH protocol, including Flooding attack, Black hole attack and Gray Hole attack will be presented. Secondly, a new DoS attack on LEACH called Scheduling attack will be introduced. In order to check the reliable operation of LEACH routing protocol, all attacks mentioned above are implemented and their impacts on the performance of the LEACH in terms of different metrics including packet delivery ratio, network lifetime and energy consumption have been evaluated.","","","","10.1109/IACS.2015.7103191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103191","Black Hole attack;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray Hole attack;LEACH;NS2;Scheduling attack;WSN;cluster;energy;network lifetime;security","Base stations;Computer crime;Data models;Floods;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","LEACH protocol;WSN;black hole attack;denial of service attacks;energy consumption;flooding attack;gray hole attack;hierarchical routing protocols;low energy aware cluster hierarchy;network lifetime;packet delivery ratio;scheduling attack;security of data transfer;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An automatic portscan detection system with adaptive threshold setting","Kim, Sang Kon; Lee, Seung Ho; Seo, Seung Woo","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science &#x0026; Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Korea","Communications and Networks, Journal of","20121220","2010","12","1","74","85","For the purpose of compromising hosts, attackers including infected hosts initially perform a portscan using IP addresses in order to find vulnerable hosts. Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a technique for the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) integrate together with a unified malicious software analysis platform. The NDIS model supports hybrid network transport NDIS drivers, called NDIS intermediate drivers. This driver lies between transport driver and NDIS driver. The advantage of using NDIS intermediate drivers is, it can see the entire network traffic taking place on a system as the drivers lie between protocol drivers and network drivers.

We propose a distributed scheme that can mitigate the damage caused by DDoS through a coordinated detection and response framework. This proposed scheme composes of a number of heterogeneous defense systems which cooperate with each other in protecting Internet servers. We have set up a network testbed for carrying out extensive experiments using real server machines, routers and software attack tools. Experimental results show that, compared to existing schemes, our proposed scheme can greatly improve the throughput of legitimate traffic and reduce the attack traffic during DDoS attacks. To investigate the scale-up behavior of our scheme, we have also developed a software simulator for larger-scale experiments.

For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

In this paper we investigate the applicability of neural networks for traffic prediction, focusing on the multilayer feedforward architecture and comparing the performance of different back-propagation algorithms. Prediction is carried out for different random aggregates (obtained through reversible sketches, introduced to improve the scalability of the solution) of traffic flows and, after comparing the prediction error with a threshold, a voting procedure is used to decide about the nature of the current data (with the additional possibility of identifying anomalous flows thanks to the features of reversible sketches). The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method (in terms of low false alarm rates and convergence speed) for an adequate choice of the learning algorithm.","","","","10.1109/CAMAD.2014.7033256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033256","Anomaly Detection;Neural Network;Sketch","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Biological neural networks;Convergence;Intrusion detection;Prediction algorithms","IP networks;multilayer perceptrons","IP networks management;back-propagation algorithms;bursty nature;learning algorithm;multilayer feedforward architecture;neural network based anomaly detection;performance analysis;traffic prediction;voting procedure","","0","","22","","","1-3 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This assumption may be unreasonable in the context of attacks and intrusions. An intruder could compromise any number of the available copies of a service resulting in a false sense of security. The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility. We propose our own framework that is based on some simple principles of graph theory and well-founded concepts in topological fault tolerance, and show that it can not only unambiguously detect any such attacks on the services but is also very hard to subvert.

Modern intrusion detection applications face complex requirements - they need to be reliable, extensible, easy to manage, and have low maintenance cost. In recent years, data mining-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have demonstrated high accuracy, good generalization to novel types of intrusion, and robust behavior in a changing environment. Still, significant challenges exist in the design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labor intensive and complex engineering endeavor. This paper describes DAID, a database-centric architecture that leverages data mining within the Oracle RDBMS to address these challenges. DAID also offers numerous advantages in terms of scheduling capabilities, alert infrastructure, data analysis tools, security, scalability, and reliability.

The traces we collected help us to understand when and why the active probing fails, and let us present countermeasures to prevent it.","","","","10.1109/WONS.2014.6814725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814725","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","frequency hop communication;security of data;wireless mesh networks","active-probing-based network intrusion detection system;wireless mesh network;wireless multihop networks","","1","","12","","","2-4 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The drastic increase in network speed and detection workloads necessitates the need for highly efficient network intrusion detection systems(NIDS). Since most NIDSs need to check for a large number of known attack patterns in every packet, pattern matching becomes the most significant part of signature-based NIDSs in terms of processing and memory resources. To support segmentation of network traffic and to detect fragmented attacks, we propose a method which performs both 'partial' and 'full' pattern matching using the data structure CDAWG (Compact Direct Acyclic Word Graph). In the present work, we designed and implemented an efficient string matching algorithm using CDAWG structure. Experimental results show that this algorithm is 2.5 times faster than the currently used Aho-Corasick algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809011","Aho-Corasick;Boyer-Moore;Dawg structure;Snort;intrusion detection;pattern matching;rule database","Computer networks;Computer science;Data structures;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","data structures;digital signatures;security of data;string matching","CDAWG data structure;attack pattern;compact direct acyclic word graph;fragmented attack detection;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;pattern matching algorithm;signature-based NIDS;string matching algorithm","","0","","14","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","25","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online.

Against this backdrop, deep processing of network packets has become an important subject for researchers. Since malicious packets often disguise their sensitive information in one way or another in order to bypass the packet filter, this paper proposes a high-speed discrete content sensitive pattern match algorithm for imperceptible deep packet filtering. The filter sets up and manages (including lookup and update) a sensitive information database, monitors both packet header and payload at line speed with hardware-based discrete content sensitive pattern match, and then executes the corresponding action. The paper mainly discusses a TCAM (ternary content addressable memory)-based pattern match algorithm as well as the architecture and performance analysis of a packet filtering system based on this algorithm. We present a totally new idea of hardware-based discrete content sensitive pattern match.

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology. Based on the observations, we make valuable conclusions about which attacks induce more false alarm and impact on Mobile Ad Hoc Network.","","978-1-4244-9004-2","","10.1109/INTERACT.2010.5706198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706198","Attacks;MANET;Wireless Networks","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Watches;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","MANET;base station;centralized access point;constant nodes;constrained capability;distributed cooperation;dynamic topology;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;network traffics;node legitimate information;open medium;packet delivery ratio;pervasive trust management model enhancement;routing protocol;throughput;varying pause time;wireless mobile hosts","","0","","29","","","3-5 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.","1550-445X","978-1-4799-3629-8","","10.1109/AINA.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655","Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security","Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology","filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection","","0","","19","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing an online IDS to the storage controller is essential for dealing with compromised hosts or coordinated attacks by multiple hosts. SAN block storage controllers are connected to the world via block-level protocols, such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. Usually, block-level storage systems do not maintain information specific to the file-system using them. The range of threats that can be handled at the block level is limited. A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions. IDStor maintains a block-to-file mapping that is updated online. Using this mapping, IDStor infers the semantics of file-level commands from the intercepted block-level operations, thereby detecting file-level intrusions by merely observing the block read and write commands passing between the hosts and the controller.","","978-1-4244-7152-2","978-1-4244-7153-9","10.1109/MSST.2010.5496974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496974","","Access protocols;Control systems;Event detection;File systems;Home appliances;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Storage area networks;Telecommunication traffic","file organisation;security of data;storage area networks","SAN block storage controller;block level protocol;file level command;file level intrusion detection system;storage area network;storage controller","","1","","18","","","3-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High performance security analytics is proposed to address this challenge by which the real-time event information can be normalized, centralized, and correlated to help identify the current running state of the target environment. As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize, access, and process different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. In this paper, the multi-core architecture is introduced on the event correlation module of SAL platform by which the correlation tasks can be executed in parallel by different computing resources. The k-means algorithm is implemented as an example of possible event clustering and correlation algorithms. Several experiments are conducted and analyzed to show that the performance of analytics can be significantly improved by applying multi-core architecture in the event correlation procedure.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2013.6717881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717881","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Security","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;pattern clustering;security of data;storage management","IT-Infrastructure;SAL platform;SIEM platform;application logs;central interface;central storage;computing resources;correlation algorithms;correlation tasks;event clustering;event correlation module;high performance security analytics;in-memory data management technique;k-means algorithm;management methods;multicore architecture;next generation security information and event management platform];real-time event information;real-time events;security analytics lab;security event correlation;system logs","","0","","8","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud computing uses virtualisation technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its advantages. Virtualisation is the key to consolidate the computing resources to run multiple instances on each hardware, increasing the utilization rate of every resource, thus reduces the number of resources needed to buy, rack, power, cool, and manage. Cloud computing has very appealing features, however, lots of enterprises and users are still reluctant to move into cloud due to serious security concerns related to virtualisation layer. Thus, it is foremost important to secure the virtual environment. In this paper, we present an elastic framework to secure virtualised environment for trusted cloud computing called Server Virtualisation Security System (SVSS). SVSS provide security solutions located on hypervisor for Virtual Machines by deploying malicious activity detection techniques, network traffic analysis techniques, and system resource utilization analysis techniques. SVSS consists of four modules: Anti-Virus Control Module, Traffic Behavior Monitoring Module, Malicious Activity Detection Module and Virtualisation Security Management Module.

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops. We also analyze the security of DAPP under different attack models, demonstrating its capability to deal with various types of attacks","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198821","","Authentication;Capacitive sensors;Communication system security;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Network servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Blundo scheme;Mica2 Motes;distributed authentication;distributed authentication protocol;node capture;physical tampering;program integrity verification;sensor program manipulation;severe resource constraints;soft tamper-proofing scheme;wireless sensor networks security","","1","4","22","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, sensor nodes are henceforth considered as Internet hosts and may act freely as web clients or servers. Undoubtedly, security and end-users privacy issues rise and become more severe in the IoT, due to the asymmetric nature of the communications between sensor nodes and the ordinary Internet hosts. Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process. For an extreme lightweight end-to-end security, we propose to combine both compression and distribution models for HIP in WSNs side, in the IoT. The partial evaluation results show that the proposed protocol, named compressed and distributed HIP (CD-HIP), is more adapted than the standard HIP, while introducing minor header communication overhead.","","978-1-4799-6608-0","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990267","6LoWPAN compression;Host Identity Protocol;Internet of Tinhgs;IoT;Wireless Sensor Networks;distributed HIP Base Exchange;end-to-end security","Hip;IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;file servers;personal area networks;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN;CD-HIP;IP-based security protocols;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;Web clients;Web servers;communication overhead;compressed and distributed HIP;computational-load distribution techniques;distribution scheme;end-to-end security;host identity protocol;messages compression;wireless sensor networks","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396","Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection","Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip","authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching","antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor","","0","","25","","2011-03-28","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","27","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Signatures are often specified in the form of regular expressions (regex), called patterns, which are traditionally implemented as finite automata. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is fast, but requires prohibitive amounts of memory which limits their practical use. Instead of matching an incoming packet with each individual regex in a ruleset, we match the packet with a fixed substring, called fingerprint, of a regex first. Fixed string matching is faster and consumes less energy than regex matching. The fact is that if a packet does not match with the fingerprint of a regex, it will not match the regex itself. So fingerprints can be used in a prefilter engine to filter out those packets and do not match any of the fingerprints of the regex in a rule set, which represents normal non-malicious traffic. This actually reduces the number of regex rules being matched, which results in increased throughput of the NIDS. We present a weight scheme to extract a good fingerprint from a regex. A good fingerprint is the one that not only indicates the regex uniquely, but also occurs as less as possible in the matching procedure. We demonstrate how to use fingerprints for efficient prefiltering by means of Bloom filters in practice.","","978-1-4244-4816-6","978-1-4244-4817-3","10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349207","bloom filter;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;prefilter;weight scheme","Automata;Computer viruses;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Filters;Fingerprint recognition;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads","computer viruses;digital signatures;feature extraction;filtering theory;fingerprint identification;finite automata;string matching","Bloom filters;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;fingerprint extraction;fixed string matching;network intrusion detection system;network monitoring;network security;normal nonmalicious traffic;regex matching;regular expressions;ruleset;security threats","","2","2","10","","","16-18 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this research is to develop an intrusion detection system based on a novel concept in immunology, the Danger Theory. Dendritic Cells (DCs) are antigen presenting cells and key to the activation of the human immune system. DCs perform the vital role of combining signals from the host tissue and correlate these signals with proteins known as antigens. In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion based on time-windows. The whole population of DCs asynchronously correlates the fused signals with a secondary data stream. The behaviour of human DCs is abstracted to form the DC Algorithm (DCA), which is implemented using an immune inspired framework, libtissue. This system is used to detect context switching for a basic machine learning dataset and to detect outgoing portscans in real-time.

Searching through entire packet headers and payloads, NIDSs can identify and classify the packets that contain malicious patterns. The most essential technology to the NIDS is an efficient multiple-pattern matching algorithm, which performs exact string matching between packets and a large set of patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm (HMA) for intrusion detection, which is a two-tier and cluster-wise matching algorithm. HMA drastically reduces the amount of external memory access as well as required memory space, enabling an efficient and cost-effective real-time IDS. The simulations show that HMA significantly improves the matching performance in both the average and the worst cases (about 1.7-63 times better than the state-of-the-art algorithms).","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577938","","Clustering algorithms;Data security;Databases;Engines;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection","computer networks;pattern matching;security of data;telecommunication security","cluster-wise matching algorithm;hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm;malicious patterns;network security threats;network-based intrusion detection system;packet headers;payloads;string matching;two-tier matching algorithm","","2","1","17","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Symposium on","20080507","2008","","","32","43","This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).","","978-1-4244-2232-6","978-1-4244-2233-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736","","Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn","computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion","","4","","22","","","20-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANET is vulnerable to attacks such as Black hole attack, Gray hole attack, wormhole attack, Sybil attack, and Route table modification attack. Black hole attack has serious impact on routing and delivery ratio of packets. To overcome Black hole attack, a mechanisms such as trust based routing, intrusion detection system, sequence number comparison and Data Routing Information table (DRI) has been proposed.

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important detection that is used as a countermeasure to preserve data integrity and system availability from attacks. Data mining is being used to clean, classify, and examine large amount of network data to correlate common infringement for intrusion detection. The main reason for using data mining techniques for intrusion detection systems is due to the enormous volume of existing and newly appearing network data that require processing. The amount of data accumulated each day by a network is huge. Several data mining techniques such as clustering, classification, and association rules are proving to be useful for gathering different knowledge for intrusion detection.

Since current approaches to detecting network intrusions rely on associating individual network actions the temporal distribution of an attack throughout a network makes it extremely difficult to accurately identify the intrusion. This paper describes an approach to detecting temporally distributed attacks based on a modified Hierarchical Quilted Self-Organizing Map (HQSOM). The HQSOM approach emulates some aspects of biological neural networks by distributing the reasoning capability throughout a hierarchical structure. The approach described here combines an adaptive learning parameter with variable spatial and temporal clustering to associate the components of the attack. The results of the evaluation of the approach and opportunities for additional research are also described.","","978-1-4799-1414-2","","10.1109/NaBIC.2013.6617840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617840","Neural networks;distributed reasoning;intrusion detection;self-organizing maps","Vectors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps","HQSOM approach;ad hoc computer networks;adaptive hierarchical neural network;adaptive learning parameter;biological neural networks;hierarchical structure;modified hierarchical quilted self-organizing map;reasoning capability;temporal clustering;temporally distributed network attack detection;variable spatial clustering","","0","","18","","","12-14 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security patches may also incur vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are generated since most OSes has a lot of functionalities and their functionalities are very complex to manage the entire source code manually. Moreover, in order to use the security patch, rebooting the system is required. Some of systems such as enterprise servers and embedded systems cannot accept the rebooting. Therefore, we propose an external integrity checking system to enhance the OS security. The external integrity checking system and a target OS run on a hyper visor simultaneously, therefore, their operations do not affect each other. In addition, the integrity checking system is generated automatically with invariants. Therefore, the possibility of inserting vulnerabilities into the system is as small as possible, and the system can cover a lot of vulnerabilities.","1533-2306","978-1-4577-1118-3","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029871","invariant;monitoring service;security","Data structures;Embedded systems;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;Security;Virtual machine monitors","operating systems (computers);security of data","OS security enhancement;external integrity checking system;hyper visor;security patches;source code","","0","","12","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using this approach an engineer specifies certain hard and soft performance requirements for a multi-processor system, and allows it to be generated automatically by competitive evolution/optimisation, thus obviating the need for detailed design. To make the proposal concrete, we use the Intel IXP1200 network processor as a baseline complex system design and show how various improvements can be make to this architecture by evolutionary/competitive design. Various approaches to multi- objective optimisation (Darwin, Lamarck Baldwin, etc.) are compared and contrasted in their ability to generate architectures meeting various constraints. We also present an assessment of a proposed architecture with reference to four different packet processing roles. The merits of an ""island clocking"" scheme versus a ""common clocking"" scheme are also discussed. Our paper highlights the flexibility that this framework bestows on the designer, along with the potential to achieve cost savings and performance improvement.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579528","design space exploration;evolutionary approaches;object oriented","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Costs;Design engineering;Design optimization;Evolutionary computation;Power engineering and energy;Process design;Proposals;Space exploration","evolutionary computation;integrated circuit design;logic design;microprocessor chips;object-oriented methods","Intel IXP1200 network processor;common clocking scheme;competitive optimisation;cost analysis;design space exploration;island clocking scheme;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimisation;multiprocessor system;network processor design framework;object oriented techniques","","0","","44","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Symposium on","20090515","2009","","","99","106","In this paper we present an unsupervised approach for intrusion detection based on spectral clustering (SC). Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, the term `bad character' is a character that causes a mismatch. While checking multiple bytes in scanning the text at a time, the BLAST algorithm overcomes the reduction of the average shift value in a typical search, which is caused by the dependency on the multi-byte search unit (MBSU) and the large frequency of the last character of the given patterns. From the theoretical analysis, the authors validate the correctness of the BLAST algorithm. Also, from the experimental results across different setups, the authors show that the BLAST algorithm provides the faster search time than the other algorithms. For example, the authors obtain an enhancement by as much as 212.41% on average for various numbers of attack patterns and attack traffic conditions compared with that of the modified Wu-Manber algorithm. In addition, it is shown that the BLAST algorithm drastically reduces the amount of memory required for constructing the shift table based on a MBSU from 64 KB to 1 KB.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2011.0305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587875","","","computer network security;search problems;string matching;text analysis","B-layered bad-character SHIFT tables;BLAST algorithm;MBSU;Wu-Manber algorithm;attack patterns;attack traffic conditions;byte checking;high-speed pattern matching;multibyte search unit;multipattern matching algorithm;pattern search time;shift values;single bad-character SHIFT table;single-byte search unit;space-time tradeoff;text scanning","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society","20030923","2003","","","53","59","We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a χ<sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %. These results show promise for the use of MAID in early DOS detection using MIB traffic parameters.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232401","","Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Prototypes;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;neural nets;probability;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","χ<sup>2</sup> test;AKS;CST;DOS computer network attacks;DOS intrusion detection;Denial of Service;FDM;KKS;KS type statistic;KST;Kolmogorov-Smyrnov test;MAID;MIB traffic parameters;PDF;SNMP;anomaly status vector;combined area-KS type test;early detection;fractional deviation from mean statistic;misclassification rates;multiobservation-window;network testbed facility;neural network classifier;probability density function;similarity metrics;statistical anomaly intrusion detection;traffic intensity scenarios","","13","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
