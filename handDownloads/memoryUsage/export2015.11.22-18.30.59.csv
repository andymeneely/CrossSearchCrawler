Attacks range from sending millions of requests to a server in an attempt to slow it down, flooding a server with large packets of invalid data, to sending requests with an invalid or spoofed IP address. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. Sequential Pattern Mining is to discover the frequent sequential pattern in the sequential event dataset. Intrusion detection using sequential pattern mining is a research focusing on the field of information security. In this paper, we have implemented Apriori a candidate generation algorithm and PrefixSpan a pattern growth algorithm on a network intrusion dataset from KDD Cup 1999, 10 percent of training dataset, which is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners. To address the absence of timestamp in the dataset, we considered two approaches to generate the sequence database from the dataset. One is by taking service as reference attribute and the other one by taking a timestamp window of size one day (86400 seconds). We found that experimental results of PrefixSpan for predicting DoS attacks sequences on KDD cup 99 training dataset are efficient. These results are then compared with SPAM (Sequential Pattern Mining) algorithm which uses vertical bitmap data layout allowing for simple, efficient counting.","","978-1-4577-2077-2","","10.1109/ICCICT.2012.6398148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6398148","Data mining;DoS attacks;fuzzy sets;intrusion detection system;sequence data;time interval","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Data mining;Databases;Prediction algorithms;Unsolicited electronic mail","computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory","ACM Special Interest Group;Apriori algorithm;DoS attack sequence prediction;KDD cup 99 training dataset;PrefixSpan algorithm;SPAM algorithm;candidate generation algorithm;data mining;denial of service attack;flooding;frequent sequential pattern discovery;information security;knowledge discovery;network intrusion dataset;networking structure;pattern growth algorithm;professional organization;sequence database generation;sequential pattern mining;spoofed IP address;timestamp window;training dataset;vertical bitmap data layout","","1","","8","","","19-20 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","36","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Typically, centralized approaches to IP traffic analysis have scalability problems, which are addressed by replacing existing hardware with more powerful CPUs and faster memory. In contrast, this paper developed and implemented SCRIPT (Scalable Real-time IP Flow Record Analysis), which defines a scalable analysis framework that can be used to distribute flow records to multiple nodes performing traffic analysis in order to balance the overall workload among those nodes. Due to its generic design, the framework developed can be extended and used to distribute other metering data, such as packet headers, payloads, or accounting records.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-5366-5","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488476","Distributed Analysis;IP Flow Accounting;Peer-to-Peer","Data analysis;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Performance analysis;Protocols;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;computer network management;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic recording","Internet protocol;SCRIPT;intrusion detection;network management;network monitoring;network planning;packet headers;scalable real-time IP flow record analysis;traffic analysis","","3","","27","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A WSN is a versatile smart sensing system to support pervasive monitoring in a variety of applications. In this context available middleware platforms usually provide the Application Layer with different basic services, as shared memory or addressing repository, but do not usually provide security services such as secure links management protocol or intrusion detection. Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN. The security-related components of the proposed middleware include a light yet powerful cryptographic scheme (TAKS) and an Intrusion Detection System (WIDS): the former module exploits the topological properties of a WSN, while the latter one is based on a Weak Process Model approach.","","","","10.1109/Mobilware.2013.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775056","cryptographic scheme;intrusion detection system;middleware;security;wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cryptographic protocols;middleware;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks;application layer;cryptographic scheme;distributed resource constrained systems;intrusion detection;middleware platforms;pervasive monitoring;resource constraints;secure communications;secure links management protocol;smart sensing system;weak process model approach","","0","","40","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first generation of AISs which is inspired only by the adaptive immune system has some weak points and suffers from excessive amount of false alarms. The next generation of AISs is inspired by “Danger Theory” and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We report our experience with the modeling and detection of scoped invariants. The Xen Virtual Machine Manager is used for a case study. Our research detects a set of essential scoped invariants that are critical to the runtime integrity of Xen. One such property, that the addressable memory limit of a guest OS must not include Xen's code and data, is indispensable for Xen's guest isolation mechanism.

DNA computation, evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, and artificial immune systems are some of the research interest which can be pointed out. By means of diverse kinds of cells, molecules, and mechanisms, the immune system efficiently protects the human body against different kinds of attacks. Many immune-inspired techniques have been developed with the aim to tackle different computing problems. Network security represents one of the most significant fields that the immune-inspired techniques have been applied to. Given that mobile ad hoc networks have a decentralized nature similar to the human immune system (HIS), immune-inspired security architecture is highly expected to come across different ad hoc security problems, one of which is the malicious node that can disrupt the routing process, masquerade as the legitimate nodes, and impersonate the trusted nodes. In this paper, immune-inspired security architecture for simulating a number of HIS processes for securing mobile ad hoc networks is presented. Both the negative selection and danger theory techniques have been combined along with many other inspired processes to come up with a scalable and robust system. Distributability, second response and self recovery of nodes, are the hallmarks of the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4244-4706-0","978-1-4244-4707-7","10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5410147","","Ad hoc networks;Artificial immune systems;Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;DNA computing;Evolutionary computation;Humans;Immune system;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection","ad hoc networks;computer network security;mobile computing;telecommunication network routing","distributability;human immune system;immune inspired framework;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network security;routing;second response;self recovery","","0","","20","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current method of analyzing shell code, manual reverse engineering, is time-consuming, requires significant expertise, and would be nearly impossible for a wide-scale polymorphic attack. In this paper, we introduce Spector, a symbolic execution engine that extracts meaningful high-level actions from shell code. Spector's high-level output helps facilitate attack mitigation and classification of different payloads that have the same behavior. To evaluate Spector, we tested it with over 23,000 unique payloads. It identified eleven different classes of shell code, and processed all the payloads in just over three hours.

This method learns patterns of normal and intrusive activities to classify that use a set of Gaussian probability distribution functions. The use of maximum likelihood in detection phase has used the deviation between current and reference behavior. GMM is evaluated by dataset KDD99 without any special hardware requirements.

We propose a scalable approach inspired by the complex-adaptive control systems of social insects, such as ants and bees. These systems emerge from inter-agent communication and the collective application of simple rules. The Digital Ants framework is a bio-inspired framework that uses lightweight, mobile agents. The agents communicate using digital pheromones which enable the agents to alert each other of possible cyber security issues. All communication and coordination is both localized and decentralized thereby allowing the framework to scale across the large numbers of devices that will exist in the Smart Grid. Furthermore, being lightweight makes the agents suitable for implementation on devices with limited computational resources. This paper will provide a brief overview of the Digital Ants framework and then present results from testbed-based demonstrations that show how Digital Ants can identify a cyber security attack scenario against smart meter deployments.","","978-1-4673-4894-2","978-1-4673-4895-9","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497880","Agents;Bio-inspired;Computer security;Cyber security;Smart Grid;Smart meters","Bandwidth;Computer security;Grippers;Load flow;Smart grids;Smart meters","adaptive control;control engineering computing;mobile agents;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","bioinspired cyber security;centralized security techniques;complex-adaptive control systems;digital ant framework;digital pheromones;electric distribution systems;electric power system;interagent communication;limited computational resources;mobile agents;security risks;smart grid deployments;smart meter deployments;social insects;testbed-based demonstrations","","3","","17","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern control systems are increasingly connected to other control systems as well as to corporate systems. They are also increasingly adopting networking technology and system and application software from conventional enterprise systems. These trends can make control systems vulnerable to cyber attack, which in the case of control systems may impact physical processes causing environmental harm or injury. We present some results of the DATES (Detection and Analysis of Threats to the Energy Sector) project, wherein we adapted and developed several intrusion detection technologies for control systems. The suite of detection technologies was integrated and connected to a commercial security event correlation framework from ArcSight. We demonstrated the efficacy of our detection and correlation solution on two coupled testbed environments. We particularly focused on detection, correlation, and visualization of a network traversal attack, where an attacker penetrates successive network layers to compromise critical assets that directly control the underlying process. Such an attack is of particular concern in the layered architectures typical of control system implementations.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593242","alert correlation;anomaly detection;control system security;critical infrastructure security;intrusion;security information event management","Control systems;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Process control;Servers","security of data","DATES;commercial security event correlation framework;cyber attack;digital control systems;intrusion detection technologies;network traversal attack","","4","","22","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes and the large amount of network data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, we present an anomaly detection scheme, called SCAN (stochastic clustering algorithm for network anomaly detection), that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when audit data is not complete. We use the expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the incoming audit data and compute the missing values in the audit data.

The purpose of the MSMIDS is to bring intelligent negotiation mechanism based on multiSoftMan alliance into cooperation system so as to improve the performance and cooperation control capability of the systems.

Unlike intrusions that seek to overtly disable or damage a system, it is particularly hard to detect because it uses a variety of low/slow vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642487","","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Monitoring;Resource description framework;Sensors;Universal Serial Bus","invasive software","advanced persistent threats;application layer;attack alert;confidential data;cross-layer integration;cross-layer monitoring;data exfiltration;test based detection approaches;trojan;unauthorized leakage","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming. We show how to make fast and correct classification decisions under these constraints and apply them to real benchmark data.

After comparing various design options, we adapted from hash table data structure, employing the special hardware unit assist to calculate a hash over our unique ascending order quadruple which worked in a quite simple but efficient way that is totally different from the Snort scheme, our design not only differentiates both directions of a TCP connection and thus eliminates unwanted additional search operation, but also avoids data corruption and greatly reduces the probability of hash collisions. In order to improve the allocation/deallocation procedure for TCP connection nodes in our IDS systems, we further devised a large management stack caching with a local memory buffer, which is fully exploiting the specialized network processor architectures and optimizing the use of various types of memories with different speeds and size. The theoretical analysis and experiments confirmed that the combination of a large conventional hash table-based search and an array-based stack with caching improves the performance significantly.","","978-0-7695-3997-3","","10.1109/ICEE.2010.338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591627","IDS;hash table;nework processor;stack and cache","Context;Delay;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Random access memory;Resource management","cache storage;computer network security;cryptography;parallel processing;transport protocols","NP based IDS;SCUT NIDS;TCP;array based stack;hash table;network processor architecture;portscan detection module;stack caching","","0","","6","","","7-9 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Relatively, little attention has been paid for employing a second line of defense that can detect intrusive behavior after successfully penetrating the first one.

Storage-based intrusion detection system (SIDS) has become a valuable tool in monitoring for the intrusion. However, the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection. Through analysis, we find that the impact of intrusion detection on the OBSS is negligible. The advantage of this approach is simple.

Regular expressions have become a necessary and basic capability of intrusion detection systems, but their implementation tends to be expensive in terms of memory cost and time performance. This work provides an architecture that reduces the exponential NFA to DFA conversion cost to a linear growth for many expressions. By handling the timing and integration of the regular expression-based rules in a custom microcontroller, the memory costs are reduced and the capabilities are increased over a DFA-only solution. Both the microcontroller and its associated DFA are implemented on the FPGA. The patterns and software are stored using run-time programmable memory tables. This allows on-the-fly modification to the regular expressions. This paper presents the design details of the regular expression microcontroller and its integration to the DFA state machines. The types of expressions that the system can handle efficiently are discussed as well as the outstanding problems that continue to challenge the community.","","1-4244-0312-X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101008","","Costs;Data security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Microcontrollers;Power system security;Runtime;Throughput","electronic engineering computing;field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;logic design;microcontrollers;reconfigurable architectures;security of data","DFA state machines;FPGA devices;deterministic finite automata;exponential NFA-DFA conversion;intrusion detection systems;network security applications;reconfigurable hardware;regular expression microcontroller;regular expression software deceleration;run-time programmable memory tables","","11","1","22","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regular expression matching, despite its flexibility and efficiency in attack identification, brings significantly high computation and storage complexities to NIDSes, making line-rate packet processing a challenging task. In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2244791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475958","Deep packet inspection (DPI);deterministic finite automaton (DFA);network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes);nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)","Acceleration;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Educational institutions;Engines;Memory management;Pattern matching","finite automata;security of data;string matching","NIDS;StriFA acceleration scheme;attack database;attack identification;data stream;high-speed regular expression matching;line-rate packet processing;malicious information;network intrusion detection systems;stride finite automata;string matching;traffic stream","","2","","31","","2013-03-07","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

More precisely, this paper shows how DDoS attacks can exhaust controller resources and provides a solution to detect such attacks based on the entropy variation of the destination IP address.

As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize and access different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. To correlate the information from different sources and identify the meaningful information is another challenging task, which makes great sense for quickly judging the current situation and making the decision. In this paper, the multi-core processing technique is introduced in the SAL platform. Various correlation algorithms, e.g., k-means based algorithms, ROCK and QROCK clustering algorithms, have been implemented and integrated in the multi-core supported SAL architecture.

Network topology authentication, and hybrid key cryptography are the building blocks for this proposal: the former means that a cryptographic key can be generated if and only if the current network topology is compliant to the ldquoplanned network topologyrdquo, which acts as the authenticated reference; the latter means that the proposed scheme is a combination of features from symmetric (for the ciphering and authentication model) and asymmetric cryptography (for the key generation model). The proposal fits the security requirement of a cryptographic scheme for WSN in a limited computing resource. A deep quantitative security analysis has been carried out.

The IDS analyses the update phenomena of each of the motes in the network and computes an Intrusion Warning Score (IWS) that indicates a possible intrusion due to an illegitimate software update.","","","","10.1109/ICARA.2015.7081151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081151","","Protocols;Robot sensing systems;Security;Software;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;robot programming;security of data;software maintenance;system monitoring;wireless sensor networks","IDS;IWS;OTA update protocols;WSN assisted environments;WSN collaboration;WSN environments;WSN sink;WSN software update protocol;WSN software updates monitoring;illegitimate software update;intrusion detection system;intrusion warning score;mote running software;over the air update protocols;robots;wireless sensor network","","0","","33","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dramatic features of HIS like distributability, uniqueness, adaptability, mobility, imperfect-detection, and anomaly-detection, have grabbed the attention of computational researchers for adopting HIS principles to design AIS that are robust, scalable, highly flexible, resilient to sub-versioning, and degrade gracefully. Designers of AIS make use of their creative abilities for designing computational systems by extracting corresponding metaphors from HIS.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","1","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6231-5","","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Asymmetric Concurrency;Computational Model;Intrusion Detection;Memory Observation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data structures;Information security;Interference;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","computational model;concealment mechanism;concurrent observations;concurrent processing units;cost model;data structures;forced synchronization;interleaved linearization;malicious code;observation mechanism;privilege escalation;resource contention;second-order operation;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency","","2","","19","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security mechanism for WSNs has to be considered differently from traditional network. Firstly, there are severe constraints on WSNs devices such as minimal energy, computational and communicational capabilities. Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is lightweight due to the monitor nodes were not loaded with any ordinary nodes or BS. Moreover, the proposed mechanism does not cause the communication overhead.","","978-4-907764-34-0","978-4-907764-33-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334764","detecting sinkhole attacks;intruder detection;security in wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","RSSI;base station;communication system;extra monitor node;intrusion detection;node capture;physical attack;received signal strength indicator;security system;sinkhole attack detection;tampering;wireless sensor network","","0","","19","","","18-21 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inside the infrastructure, specific runtime protections have been implemented for different kernel objects, kernel data structures are protected by the periodic detection and recovery, the interception of arguments is used to protect vulnerable system calls. At runtime once any system inconsistency has been detected, predefined recovery actions will be invoked. The consistency detection regulations and corresponding recovery actions can also be flexibly customized by system developers. The infrastructure requires few modifications to kernel source code, thus it is easy to integrate into existing embedded systems. The evaluation experiment results indicate our prototype system can correctly detect the inconsistent kernel data structures caused by security attacks and also prevent kernel from exploits due to vulnerable system calls with acceptable penalty to system performance. Moreover, it is fully software-based without introducing any specific hardware and requires no modifications to system call APIs, therefore legacy commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications can be also easily reused.","","978-0-7695-3492-3","","10.1109/EUC.2008.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756331","Detection;Recovery;Reliability;Security","Data security;Data structures;Embedded system;Kernel;Object detection;Protection;Prototypes;Runtime;Software prototyping;System performance","application program interfaces;data structures;embedded systems;operating system kernels;security of data;system monitoring;system recovery","commercial-off-the-shelf application;embedded system;kernel data structure;kernel object;kernel source code;lightweight system-level detection;recovery infrastructure;runtime protection;security attack;system call API;system call function;vulnerable system call","","0","","22","","","17-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since software implementation may not keep pace with the high-speed demand, turning to hardware-based solutions becomes promising. This work presents an innovative architecture to realize string matching in sub-linear time based on algorithmic heuristics, which come from parallel queries to a set of space-efficient Bloom filters. The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module. This architecture is simulated with both behavior simulation in C and timing simulation in HDL for antivirus applications. The simulation shows that the throughput of scanning Windows executable files for more than 10000 virus signatures can achieve 5.64 Gb/s, while the worst-case performance is 1.2 Gb/s if the signatures are properly specified.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2012011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840440","Algorithms;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);string matching","","C language;digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;logic design;program verification;string matching","Bloom filter;C language;HDL;algorithmic heuristics;antivirus application;bad-block heuristic;behavior simulation;field programmable gate array;hardware accelerator;linear worst-case time method;network security;nonblocking interface;parallel query;sublinear time string-matching algorithm;timing simulation;verification module;virus signature","","5","","39","","2009-04-24","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper explores a multi-modal genetic algorithm solution for autonomous rule creation. This algorithm focuses on the process of creating rules once an intrusion has been identified, rather than the evolution of rules to provide a solution for intrusion detection. The algorithm was demonstrated on anomalous ICMP network packets (input) and Snort rules (output of the algorithm). Output rules were sorted according to a fitness value and any duplicates were removed. The experimental results on ten test cases demonstrated a 100 percent rule alert rate. Out of 33,804 test packets 3 produced false positives. Each test case produced a minimum of three rule variations that could be used as candidates for a production system.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949394","Computational intelligence;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","Genetic algorithms;Humans;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Runtime;Syntactics","genetic algorithms;security of data","Snort rules;anomalous ICMP network packets;anomaly based network intrusion detection;autonomous rule creation;multi-modal genetic algorithm","","1","","16","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the existing key management schemes concentrate only on network structures and key allocation algorithms, ignoring attributes of the nodes themselves. Due to the distributed and dynamic nature of MANETs, it is possible to show that there is a security benefit to be attained when the node states are considered in the process of constructing a private key generator (PKG). In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes. The proposed scheme can select the best nodes to be used as PGKs from all available ones considering their security conditions and energy states. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can decrease network compromising probability and increase network lifetime.","","978-1-4244-5238-5","978-1-4244-5239-2","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379731","","Computer network management;Computer networks;Cryptography;Engineering management;Identity management systems;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Research and development;Research and development management;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;cryptography;military communication;mobile communication;telecommunication network management","hierarchical identity based key management scheme;military applications;network lifetime;tactical mobile ad hoc networks","","1","","15","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Comparing with other related algorithms, the main improvement of this algorithm is that it process patterns in the form of natural language instead of formal patterns. This algorithm's correctness is strictly proved and its time complexity is linear. The experiment proved that this algorithm can be used to judge whether two patterns are match and to unify two patterns to be one pattern if they are match.

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall ""network behavior"" of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system. Results shows that the richness of the Network Connectivity Graph provides a much more detailed picture of malicious activities, considerably enhancing our understanding.","","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288435","","IP networks;Itemsets;Malware;Monitoring;Protocols;Servers","Internet;graph theory;invasive software","Internet;Malware;malicious activities;malicious pattern;malicious traffic dissection;network behavior;network connectivity graph;network user privacy;network users security;research community;security practitioners","","","","","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
