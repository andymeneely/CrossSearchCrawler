This paper proposes a new framework to detect anomalies and to provide early alerts for flooding attacks in backbone networks. Thus allow to quickly react in order to prevent the flooding attacks from strangling the victim server and its access network. The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rate.

The scheme has self- and context-awareness in addition to a holistic view of security services at each layer of the communication stack. It uses distributed agents and intrusion detection systems to monitor the security threats and then dynamically adapts its security level by jointly considering several dimensions. This translates into optimal security-energy under a given resource and context. The key dimensions are energy budget, computing power and memory size of nodes, location-based security threat levels, data coherence, and data lifetime. Trust management is used to test the integrity of untrusted nodes which further assist the adaptation decision.","","","","10.1109/WoWMoM.2014.6919023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919023","","Coherence;Decision making;Encryption;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","context awareness;decision adaptation;energy aware adaptive security management;optimal security-energy;resource adaptability;security adaptability;self awareness;wireless sensor networks","","0","","8","","","19-19 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in most of these cases the file has to be either run in a dynamic environment or has to be disassembled to look at its content. We present here a novel method to look at the files without the need of executing or disassembling them. We also provide a framework that implements our method on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We use a novel approach to identify byte-patterns that can be used to do static analysis of binaries.

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net. WSNs are particularly vulnerable to failure under such attacks because of their limited energy, processing capacity, and storage. An effective DoS attack merely has to deplete the resources of the nodes to render them unavailable. In this paper we design and implement a preliminary intrusion detection system (IDS) for WSNs that addresses the security concern of DoS attacks and fits the demands and restrictions of WSNs.","","978-1-4244-0941-9","978-1-4244-0941-9","10.1109/EIT.2007.4374444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374444","Attack;Denial of Service (DoS);Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Network","Batteries;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Event detection;Floods;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","denial of service attacks;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","5","","15","","","17-20 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of ldquoUser Contributed Designsrdquo at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ldquoopen-source hardwarerdquo platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming-and more error prone-than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository.","","978-1-4244-4407-6","978-1-4244-4406-9","10.1109/MSE.2009.5270838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270838","","Acoustic testing;Education;Ethernet networks;Internet;Open source hardware;Open source software;Process design;Software design;Software standards;Solids","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;open systems;user centred design","NetFPGA platform;NetFPGA repository;NetFPGA.org;developer-community;integrated testing;networking systems;open-source hardware platform;reusable modules;reusable network hardware design;software oriented open-source projects;user contributed designs","","0","","7","","","25-27 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Application level classification of P2P traffic, especially without payload feature detection, is still a challenging problem. This paper proposes a new method for P2P traffic identification and application level classification, which merely uses transport layer information. The method uses support vector machines which have been optimized for performing large learning tasks, rendering that this method become more suitable for large network traffic.

This proliferation, in combination with the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods. Fuzzy-based systems accommodate the imprecision associated with mutated and previously unidentified attack modes. This paper presents an evolutionary-fuzzy approach to intrusion detection that is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to other evolutionary approaches.

Centralized access control determination fails to work in mobile ad-hoc networking environments, as the information necessary for pre-configuration is not available. This situation is exacerbated by the dynamic nature of the environment's membership, so that the time and resources expended in offline management are largely wasted. This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate interaction partners. A distributed, node-centric approach to reputation management processes nodal behavior feedback and provides a reputation index that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations. The availability of a reputation index gives a measure of expectation of a peer's behavior, based on past performance, and makes a MANET a more distributed operational environment.","","0-7803-9290-6","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495969","","Access control;Availability;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Environmental management;Feedback;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Resource management;Waste management","ad hoc networks;authorisation;computer network management;groupware;mobile radio;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc collaborative environment;decentralized trust-based access control system;distributed node-centric approach;distributed operational environment;dynamic collaboration;interaction partners;mobile ad hoc network;nodal behavior feedback;offline management;peer trustworthiness;reputation index;reputation management;sociological trust;trust management","","5","","28","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generated by exploiting these vulnerabilities have performance impact on both victim as well as on other hosts sharing the communication path. Hence in order to protect the computational and bandwidth resources of the shared path, the anomalies caused by these attacks are to be detected and the attack traffic should be filtered out from the network elements. Under the context of flow state maintenance not deployed in the network elements, the bandwidth characterization of the attack traffic is essential to deploy the filtering rules in the equipments. In this work we have considered the network bandwidth characterization of a highly critical DDoS attack in the network: the distributed reflector attack through spoofed IPv6 flows. The generated spoofed IPv6 traffic from the attacker (slaves), the reflector attack traffic caused by the responses from the reflector and the victim, and the end-to-end path bandwidth characteristics of these flows over a 6 to 4 tunnel are reported in terms of flow rates and per flow packet count. The flow rate pattern of the spoofed flows is modeled at the attacker side using inter departure time and packet size. The impact of network scale factor on the flow rate pattern over the path is studied and reported. We also have quantified the reflector attack flow rate in the presence of the scale factor and multiple spoofed flow sources.","0742-1303","978-1-61284-926-3","","10.1109/LCN.2011.6115573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6115573","","Bandwidth;Estimation;Generators;Level measurement;Servers;Size measurement;Time measurement","IP networks;next generation networks;protocols;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;IPv6 based reflector attacks;IPv6 communication protocol;distributed denial of service;flow state maintenance;next generation networks;path behavior characteristics;security threats","","0","","13","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the inherent nature of PCM technology does not align perfectly with either applications in terms of cost-per-bit, performance, power, endurance or retention. The missing killer applications for PCM have slowed down the technology development from becoming mainstream. From the systems perspective, the ever-growing big data problems call for a paradigm shift from traditional compute-centric system to data-centric system for better performance, efficiency and productivity. A data-centric system will demand new hardware features to support the efficient storage and manipulation of data in a wide range of data-intensive applications. Considering these factors, this paper will give an overview of recent research efforts to enable PCM for building a reliable and efficient ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). By leveraging multiple levels of computing stack - technology, circuit and architecture, we will show a holistic approach of tailoring PCM to meeting the new system requirements.

To experiment with this approach, we developed a system with FPGAs that ingests content over a network at high data rates. The system extracts basewords, counts words, scores documents, and discovers concepts on data that are carried in TCP/IP network flows as packets over a Gigabit Ethernet link or in cells transported over an OC48 link. These algorithms, as implemented in FPGA hardware, introduce certain constraints on the complexity and richness of the semantic processing algorithms.

During the same period of time increasing demands for more trustworthy network infrastructure have seen the development of sophisticated analysis tools necessary to meet the operational requirements of law enforcement agencies. These include tools for e-discovery, commercial intelligence and national security. Thus the industry has seen equally significant developments in computer forensic tools where methods of searching for and detection of, malicious activity for presentation as evidence and provision of trust have become ever more sophisticated. To a considerable degree the science of security and forensics have seen both rapid but separate developments. This paper proposes that there are areas in common between these two important fields of endeavour and sets out techniques and ideas which demonstrate how they can overlap and work together in order to provide improved security and trustworthiness in critical infrastructures. In particular this paper addresses computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective such that security events can be monitored in a live network while sound forensic data collection, storage and processing can be carried out in a manner which supports real-time security and at the same time still meeting the requirements of sound evidence.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593243","","Computer architecture;Computers;Fires;Forensics;Monitoring;Real time systems;Security","computer forensics;computer network security;government data processing;national security","computer forensic tools;computer security;critical infrastructure protection;e-discovery;intrusion detection techniques;law enforcement agencies;malicious activity detection;national security;network forensics;trustworthy network infrastructure","","2","","12","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protecting individual guest operating system by using antivirus and commercial security defense mechanism is cost effective and ineffective for virtualized environment. To solve this problem, Virtual Machine Introspection has emerged as one of the promising approaches to secure the state of the virtual machine. Virtual Machine Introspection inspects the state of multiple virtual machines by operating outside the virtual machine i.e. at hypervisor level.

However, as the VMs from different customers are running on the same host, an attack to the management virtual machine will easily lead to the compromise of the guest VMs. Therefore, it is critical for a cloud computing system to ensure the trustworthiness of management VMs. To this end, we propose VMGuard, an integrity monitoring and detecting system for management virtual machines in a distributed environment. VMGuard utilizes a special VM, Guard Domain, which runs on each physical node to monitor the co-resident management VMs. The integrity measurements collected by the Guard Domains are sent to the VMGuard server for safe store and independent analysis.

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services","","","","4","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed.

In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort).

Moreover, it is very difficult to find a real origin of attackers because DoS/DDoS attacker uses spoofed IP addresses. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic route selection algorithm to trace the attacker's real origin. This algorithm uses three types of packets such as an alert packet, an agent packet and a reply agent packet. The alert packet is in use to notify to a victim that DDoS attacks occur. The agent packet is in use to find the attacker's real origin and the reply agent packet is in use to notify to a victim that the agent packet is reached the edge router of the attacker. When source-end detector and victim-end detector detect attacks, the victim-end detector sends the alert packet to the victim. The victim received the alert packet generates the agent packet and sends it to a victim's edge router. The attacker's edge router received the agent packet generates the reply agent packet and send it to the victim. The agent packet and the reply agent packet is forwarded refer to probabilistic packet forwarding table by routers. The probabilistic route selection algorithm runs on the distributed routers and probabilistic packet forwarding table is stored and managed by routers. We simulate for the propose of validation this algorithm by using OPNET14.0 in terms of false positive and required number of packets to trace DDoS attack traffic source.","","978-1-4244-9222-0","978-1-4244-9223-7","10.1109/ICISA.2011.5772420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772420","","Computer crime;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Logic gates;Probabilistic logic;Watermarking","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;probability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack traffic source;DoS attack;Internet;OPNET14.0;agent packet;alert packet;distributed denial of service;probabilistic packet forwarding;probabilistic route selection algorithm;reply agent packet;source-end detector;spoofed IP addresses;victim-end detector","","0","","7","","","26-29 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this model, every immune agent owns a small detector set which represents its detection function. After biological immune principles are introduced, the corresponding distributed intrusion detection model is described in detail. With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets.

"Design consideration of Network Intrusion detection system using Hadoop and GPGPU","Bandre, S.R.; Nandimath, J.N.","Dept. of Comput.

This paper deals with design consideration of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on the Hadoop framework and acceleration of its performance by using General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU). The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings. Analytics over intrusion is done by using a Score-Weight approach called as Pattern Frequency Inverse Cluster Frequency (PF-ICF). The design consideration of accelerated NIDS is a solution towards the performance issues of various NIDS that faces due to the large volumes of the network traffic.","","","","10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087201","CUDA;GPGPU;Hadoop;NIDS;Network Security","Algorithm design and analysis;Ecosystems;Graphics processing units;Intrusion detection;Servers;Telecommunication traffic","data analysis;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming;security of data","CUDA;Compute Unified Device Architecture;Flume;GPGPU;HBase;Hadoop framework;Hive;NIDS;NVidia;PF-ICF;Pig;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion pattern analytics;log files;network intrusion detection system;network security policy;network traffic;parallel programming model;pattern frequency inverse cluster frequency;score-weight approach;streaming data handling","","0","","15","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET. The purpose of this paper is to present an improved version of EAACK called EAACK2 that performs better in the presence of false misbehavior and partial dropping.","1550-445X","978-1-61284-313-1","978-0-7695-4337-6","10.1109/AINA.2011.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763422","DSA;Digital Signature;EAACK;MANET","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Encryption;Mobile computing;Public key;Receivers","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","DSA;EAACK scheme;MANET;digital signature algorithm;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;forged acknowledgement detection;mobile ad hoc network;wireless communication mechanisms","","5","1","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server.

"Improving a network security system by recongurable hardware","Li, S.; Torresen, J.; Sorasen, O.","Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, N-03 16 Oslo, Norway","Norchip Conference, 2004. Proceedings","20050502","2004","","","135","138","Improving network security systems by using recon gurable hardware is an important research eld since the speed of the Internet is increasing. In this work, we have implemented stateful TCP inspection in a Field Programmable Gate Array (EPGA) to help alleviating a bottleneck in network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs). Today's software based NIDSs (eg. Snort) show inef ciency and even fail to perform for the faster Internet. Implementing stateful TCP inspection in EPGA aims at achieving an ef cient, fast NIDS in general, - Snort speci cally. By dividing a TCP connection into two ows, one to the Sewer and another to the Client, monitoring of the TCP ow can be sped up. A TCP ow deals not only with a single packet but also with multiple packets over the network. Reassembly of those packets is one of the main tusks that the TCP ow monitoring should accomplish. By parallelizing the tasks of reassembling TCP packets on the Sewer and the Client on an EPGA, the performance of stateful TCP inspection can be greatly improved. The performance obtained by this work is a throughput of 2.75 Gbps.","","0-7803-8510-1","","10.1109/NORCHP.2004.1423841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423841","","Communication system security;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Informatics;Inspection;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","","","","0","2","9","","","8-9 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and difference distance map are used for selection of significant features. This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain. The similarity between new incoming packets and a normal profile is determined using Euclidean distance on the simple, low-dimensional feature domain.

In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for Web browsing. When applied to real Web browsing traffic, the algorithms were able to discount 98.5% of measured bytes and effectively isolate information leaks.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3633-0","","10.1109/SP.2009.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207641","Forensics;HTTP;Information Leaks;Intrusion Detection;Web Traffic","Bandwidth;Cryptography;IP networks;Inspection;Internet;Network servers;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Volume measurement","Internet;hypermedia;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;data loss prevention systems;hypertext transfer protocol;information leaks;network bandwidth;network traffic;outbound Web browsing traffic;protocol specifications","","12","1","27","","","17-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prompt action by DNS server operators minimized the duration and impact of the attack, which had little effect on overall Internet performance. Intrusion detection systems are researched and developed to detect attacks from outside world since 1980. Intrusion detection systems create an alert data or log data when detect an intrusion. But Many IDS uses heterogeneous data set, so these data must be mapped to another format. IDWG in IETF proposed IDMEF. This paper designs an alert data format compatible IDMEF. The secure networking framework is consisted of SGS and CPCS. SGS acts as an intrusion detection system on edge of network ingress point, and CPCS acts as a higher-level server. SGS makes an alert data compatible IDMEF and sends it to CPCS. CPCS parses an IDMEF alert data and makes an alert object for using correlation analysis. SGS can see its area only, but CPCS can see wide network area. CPCS can detect more complex attacks as well as support integrated management through cooperating each other. In the view of alert processing we converted raw alert data to Ladon-alert data to support interoperability. We use IDMEF-compatible alert datat structure.

To overcome the problems, we propose a system using alteration of data. Our proposed system detects illegal alteration with verifier for vulnerable data. Verifier is made before vulnerable data could be altered by attackers, and verifier is checked when the program uses the vulnerable data.

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710","Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching","Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security","buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching","AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection","","0","","12","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared to intrusion detection, automated response has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we present the design of automated response mechanisms in an intrusion tolerant system called ADEPTS. Our focus is on enforcing containment in the system, thus localizing the intrusion and allowing the system to provide service, albeit degraded. ADEPTS uses a graph of intrusion goals, called I-GRAPH, as the underlying representation in the system. In response to alerts from an intrusion detection framework, ADEPTS executes algorithms to determine the spread of the intrusion and the appropriate responses to deploy. A feedback mechanism evaluates the success of a deployed response and uses that in guiding future choices. ADEPTS is demonstrated on a distributed e-commerce system and evaluated using a survivability metric.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467825","attack graphs;automated intrusion response;distributed e-commerce systems;intrusion containment;survivability","Computer security;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Electronic commerce;Feedback;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching","electronic commerce;fault tolerant computing;graph theory;security of data","attack graph;automated intrusion response;distributed e-commerce system;intrusion detection system;intrusion tolerant system;survivability metric","","11","","19","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New approaches and methods are often tested in offline environment or on low-speed links using software solutions, but consecutive real-time deployment on high-speed links is missing. In this context we propose a flexible network probe which is a foundation stone for further network measurement and monitoring. The architecture of the probe is based on a network acceleration card with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and a host computer. The configuration for FPGA chips is automatically generated by a configuration program according to the user's definition of the monitored values in order to save hardware resources and increase the throughput. The definition of the monitoring process is described using XML, transformed to VHDL and synthesized. This enables the probe to gain any information about network traffic, assign it to the flow and process it, all of which can be arbitrarily defined by the user.","","978-1-4244-2276-0","978-1-4244-2277-7","10.1109/DDECS.2008.4538788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4538788","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Field programmable gate arrays;IP networks;Probes;Semiconductor device measurement;Software testing;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;XML;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;logic design;telecommunication links;telecommunication traffic","FPGA chips;Internet traffic;VHDL;XML;field-programmable gate arrays;flexible flow monitoring;high-speed links;low-speed links;network acceleration card;network probe;real-time deployment","","2","","20","","","16-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the authentication method used by computers on the network affects its safety. Static authentication methods are applied only once at the beginning of a user session. Unfortunately, these methods provide no protection from the interactions a user has after they are logged on and using the system. An ongoing dynamic authentication supplements an intrusion detection system by recognizing a masquerader, or a legitimate user's change of intent. In this paper, we statistically analyze the underlying distributions of the time between user commands and develop an analytic model that emulates the underlying mathematical properties of user behaviors. From this, we show how the probabilities of users executing a sequence of commands during a session can be ascertained. Finally, via our experimental results, we show how the efficacy of dynamic authentication schemes in networked computing environments can be improved by incorporating our techniques.","","0-7803-9445-3","0-7803-9446-1","10.1109/IDAACS.2005.283004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4062155","Computer Security;Dynamic Authentication;Network Security;Semi-Markov Processes","Authentication;Biometrics;Computer networks;Computer security;Conferences;Data acquisition;Frequency;Intelligent networks;System testing;Timing","computer network management;message authentication;statistical distributions;telecommunication security","computer networks;dynamic authentication mechanism;inter-command time distributions;intrusion detection system;legitimate user intent change;masquerader recognition;real-time network security;user probabilities","","0","","6","","","5-7 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Gaining detailed knowledge about them facilitates designing of new detection methods as well as understanding their impact. In this paper we present a testbed framework to simulate attacks that enables to study a wide range of security scenarios. The framework provides a notion of real-world arrangements, yet it retains full control over all the activities performed within the simulated infrastructures. Utilizing the sandbox environment, it is possible to simulate various security attacks and evaluate their impacts on real infrastructures. The design of the framework benefits from IaaS clouds. Therefore its deployment does not require dedicated facilities and the testbed can be deployed over miscellaneous contemporary clouds.

There are two major aspects to this work: to conduct extensive error injection experiments on the Linux kernel and to quantify the possibility of error-caused security violations using a SAN (Stochastic Activity Network) model. The error injection experiments show that about 2% of errors injected into the firewall code segment cause security vulnerabilities. Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, as long as the system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0.1 error/day during a 1-year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, 2 machines (on the average) will experience security violations. This indicates that error-caused security vulnerabilities can be a non-negligible source of a security threats to a highly secure system.","","0-7695-1101-5","","10.1109/DSN.2002.1028938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028938","","Computer aided instruction;Cryptography;Data security;Error analysis;Hardware;Kernel;Law;Legal factors;Protection;Storage area networks","Unix;authorisation;computer network reliability;network operating systems;telecommunication security","IPChains;Linux kernel;Netfilter;SAN model;Stochastic Activity Network;error injection;error-caused security vulnerabilities;experiment;firewall data corruption;highly secure system;instruction transient errors;security threat;security violations","","1","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This mimicry traffic is potentially neglected by detectors. In this paper, we propose a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based method for detecting anomalous traffic mimicking legitimate traffic. Our method firstly observes the port pair distribution of traffic flows, which is a novel statistical traffic feature proposed in this work. Secondly, our method computes the KL divergence between the port pair distributions of the current and previous time intervals. Our method starts to find anomalous flows when the KL divergence deviates from a specified threshold. We tested the performance of our method with traffic which was mixed by four synthetic mimicry anomalies and real-world backbone traffic. The results indicated that our method could precisely detect all synthetic anomalies. Furthermore, our method additionally revealed six real-world anomalies that were hidden in the testing backbone traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238570","Kullback-Leibler divergence;Statistical anomaly detection;distance measure;mimicry anomaly;statistical traffic feature","Ash;Computer crime;Detectors;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Ports (Computers)","security of data;telecommunication traffic","HTTP;KL divergence-based method;Kullback-Leibler divergence;anomalous traffic;legitimate traffic;network-based mimicry anomaly detection;port pair distribution;real-world backbone traffic;statistical traffic feature;synthetic mimicry anomalies;time intervals","","0","","","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these systems place a processor on the network interface controller (NIC) to handle some portion of the MPI processing. This processing involves traversing a linked list and invoking a matching function for each item. Although this task is critical to the performance of the system, microprocessors perform it extremely poorly. Furthermore, the traditional network processor approaches of multicore and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the list is a shared data structure. While match processing can be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations can be extremely inflexible and lead to extremely high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable architecture for a processor to handle the matching function. The matching engine approaches the performance of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and programmability. More importantly, it requires a dramatically smaller area than a conventional processor.","1552-5244","978-1-4244-1387-4","978-1-4244-1388-1","10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4629234","","Aggregates;Control systems;Data structures;Engines;Hardware;Microprocessors;Multicore processing;Multithreading;Network interfaces;Supercomputers","application program interfaces;data structures;message passing;network interfaces;parallel machines","MPI matching function;NIC;linked list;message passing interface;network interface controller;programmable processor architecture;shared data structure;supercomputer network","","0","","29","","","17-20 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, despite the growing importance of cluster security, this field has been only minimally addressed by contemporary cluster administration techniques. This paper presents a high-level view of existing security challenges related to clusters and proposes a structured approach for handling security in clustered servers.

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust. We argue that, in distributed systems where the opponent can subvert any small proportion of nodes, it is more economic to invest in resilience than in bootstrapping.","1092-1648","0-7695-2161-4","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348111","","Analytical models;Authentication;Environmental economics;Intelligent sensors;Performance analysis;Public key cryptography;Resilience;Self-organizing networks;Sensor systems;Spread spectrum communication","message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication links;wireless sensor networks","communications link;key distribution problem;key infection;key updating;low-cost node;multihop key propagation;multipath secrecy amplification;public key cryptography;self-organizing network;sensor network;smart trust","","42","2","19","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
