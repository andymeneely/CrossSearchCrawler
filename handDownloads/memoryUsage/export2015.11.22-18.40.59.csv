Current common solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely heavily on prior explicit knowledge of specific instances of malcode binary code signatures. During the time between its appearance and an update being sent to anti-virus tools, a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We present a new host-based intrusion detection approach, based on analyzing the behavior of the computer to detect the presence of unknown malicious code. The new approach consists on classification algorithms that learn from previous known malcode samples which enable the detection of an unknown malcode. We performed several experiments to evaluate our approach, focusing on computer worms being activated on several computer configurations while running several programs in order to simulate background activity. We collected 323 features in order to measure the computer behavior. Four classification algorithms were applied on several feature subsets. The average detection accuracy that we achieved was above 90% and for specific unknown worms even above 99%.","","","1-4244-1329-X","10.1109/ISI.2007.379542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258682","Malicious code detection;worms","Binary codes;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Software packages","computer viruses;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","anti-virus tool;binary code signature;classification algorithm;computer worms;host-based intrusion detection;machine learning;unknown malicious code detection","","3","","29","","","23-24 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The marked information is used to reconstruct the IP address of the ingress router connected to the attack source at the detecting end. The work is deployed in the programmable routers in real time and the attack source detection mechanisms are carried out. Attack sources are detected from the marked information in the IP header of the packet. As the detection scheme relies only on the marked information in the IP header fields, the source of the spoofed packets can also be accurately identified.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972268","DDoS attacks;attack source identification;packet marking;programmable routers","Computer crime;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Probabilistic logic;Real time systems;Workstations","computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDoS attack;IP header field;IP spoofing;attack source detection mechanism;attack source identification;distributed denial of service attack;marking algorithm;packet marking scheme;programmable router;router information;router level","","4","","7","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models. The proposed index policies apply to a more general case where a subset (more than one) of the components can be probed simultaneously. The problem under study also finds applications in spectrum scanning in cognitive radio networks and event detection in sensor networks.","1053-587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2332982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844162","Anomaly localization;composite hypothesis testing;sequential hypothesis testing;sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)","Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Delays;Indexes;Optimization;Search problems;Testing","indexing;probability;reliability;resource allocation;security of data","anomalous components;anomaly localization;cognitive radio networks;event detection;optimal index policies;probing strategy;reliability constraints;resource-constrained cyber systems;sensor networks;spectrum scanning","","3","","32","","2014-06-25","Aug.15, 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goal is to efficiently establish acceptable trust levels among mobile nodes without prior interactions. We seek to identify the optimal length of a trust chain among peers in a trust Web so as to maximize the trust levels for peers on the trust chain, by trading off trust space for trust level. The cognitive nodes in the network can dynamically adapt to changing network environments by adjusting their design parameter settings over time to establish an acceptable trust level with other nodes. We define a trust metric that captures unique characteristics of trust concepts in such MANETs. We demonstrate that an optimal trust chain exists for maximizing the trust metric.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283838","cognitive networks;hierarchical modeling;mobile ad hoc networks;reliability.;social networks;stochastic Petri nets;trust chain;trust management;trust metric","Collaboration;Communication system security;Decision making;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Petri nets;Protocols;Routing;Topology","Petri nets;ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;mobile radio;peer-to-peer computing;stochastic processes","MANET;cognitive mission-driven group communication system;cryptography;hierarchical modeling techniques;mobile ad hoc network;peer to peer network;stochastic Petri net;trust Web;trust management protocol","","16","","24","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system. At the same time, users can also manage and monitor their own confidentiality by themselves.","","978-1-4673-5612-1","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557202","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Authentication;Computational modeling;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Military computing;Monitoring","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines","AdjointVM;circular chain VM protection model;cloud administrators;cloud computing security level;cloud providers;corporate areas;external threats;host-based IDS;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;information security;internal threats;intrusion detection system service;private areas;trusted computing;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees;virtual machine monitor-based IDS","","2","","16","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In communication systems buffering is commonly used to mitigate in real time multimedia applications at the expense of an additional delay. This method is therefore not suitable for control systems implemented over packet switched communication networks due to the additional delay which can make the system unstable. Hence, jitter modelling and management is necessary. This paper focuses on the development and experimental verification of a suitable jitter model for wireless and wired network bottlenecks. The effects of jitter are then investigated by quantifying the performance of a simulated Networked Control System (NCS). According to the results, the reduction in attenuation due to jitter compared to a jitter free benchmark ranges from approximately 0.01-0.04dB depending on the encoding type.","","978-1-4799-7731-4","","10.1109/ICTER.2014.7083907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083907","Networked control systems;communication networks;cyber-physical systems;delay variation;self similarity","Attenuation;Communication networks;Delays;Encoding;Jitter;Networked control systems;Wireless communication","jitter;networked control systems;packet switching;radio networks","NCS;attenuation reduction;buffering;delay variation;empirical network jitter measurements;encoding type;jitter management;jitter modelling;multimedia applications;networked control system simulation;packet switched communication networks;wired network bottleneck;wireless network bottleneck","","0","","35","","","10-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is difficult to prevent because DDoS attacker send spoofing packets to victim which makes the identification of the origin of attacks very difficult. A series of techniques have been studied such as pattern matching by learning the attack pattern and abnormal traffic detection. However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks. Moreover, the amount of traffic flowing through the Internet increase rapidly and thus packet analysis should be done within considerable amount of time. This paper proposes a scalable, real-time traffic pattern analysis based on genetic algorithm to detect and prevent DDoS attacks on Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scalable DDoS protection system.","","","","10.1109/CEC.2015.7257075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7257075","DDoS attack;Genetic Algorithm;Hadoop","Accuracy;Computer crime;Distributed processing;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;IP networks;Sparks","computer network security;data handling;genetic algorithms;parallel processing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack prevention;Hadoop cluster computing framework;Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure;Internet security;distributed denial-of-service attack protection system;genetic algorithms;scalable DDoS protection system;spoofing packets;traffic pattern analysis","","","","22","","","25-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we study a novel danger model based anomaly detection algorithm for wireless sensor networks. The danger model is built on a sensitive tissue(ST). The sensitive tissue consists of a population of sensitive cells(SCs) that are abstracted characteristics from a node of wireless sensor networks which are sensitive to attacks. ST plays a role as an interface between problems and immune cells for danger recognition and estimation.

Based on our previous proposed TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) anomaly detection method, which can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false positive rate, we develop an instance selection mechanism for TCM-KNN based on EFCM (Extended Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm in this paper, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of TCM-KNN and boosting its detection performance.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.","","978-0-7695-2847-2","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118","","Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server","Internet;cryptography","HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems","","5","1","23","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It needs to perform exact matching on multi-pattern signatures in real time. In this paper we introduce an efficient data structure called extended Bloom filter (EBF) and the corresponding algorithm to perform the multi-pattern signature matching. We also present a technique to support long signature matching so that we need only to maintain a limited number of supported signature lengths for the EBFs. We show that at reasonable hardware cost we can achieve very fast and almost time-deterministic exact matching for thousands of signatures.

This work presents a new architecture for building an efficient NIDS to the cloud virtualization environment. By resolving the virtual system information from operating systems' kernel map in hypervisor layer, the services in the cloud can be identified exactly and the required detection rules can be adopted dynamically.

In these mechanism IDS is used which detects malicious activities caused by malicious nodes, Based on the risk of attack, temporary decision is made whether isolation is needed or not. IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks. In this paper, we propose a Authorization Enforcement Facility which uses risk as an input to determine how much a source node can be trusted.

However for a developer or team working on any network project who need to perform DPI, there is always the issue of using a third party source which may involve added cost or implementing it themselves which requires time and study of protocols, signatures and the nuances of pattern matching. The paper proposes a solution to the above problem using an adaptive grammar generation algorithm. This method reduces the entropy among similar results given by different patterns. Immense customizability is the foremost advantage of this method. Existing grammars for new signatures can be combined into a single grammar easily rather than new grammars be generated from raw target strings.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The evaluation results show that our approach can reduce the number of state access in the DFA significantly.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5962596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962596","","Automata;Computers;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","computer network security;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA-based regular expression matching;Snort;compressed traffic;deep packet inspection;layer-7 filtering;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection system;rule sets;traffic monitoring","","1","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection has been studied for approximately 20 years. It is based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions will be detectable. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are usually deployed along with other preventive security mechanisms, such as access control and authentication, as a second line of defense that protects information systems. There are several reasons that make intrusion detection a necessary part of the entire defense system. This paper describes various Intrusion Detection methods like pattern matching, state full pattern matching, protocol decode-based analysis etc and how fuzzy clustering can apply in IDS.","","","","10.1049/ic.2011.0085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193574","Fuzzy Clustering;Integrated Service Checker;Intrusion;Protocol Decode-Based Analysis","","authorisation;fuzzy set theory","IDS;access control;authentication;fuzzy clustering;information system;intrusion detection methods;intrusion detection systems;intrusion identification;preventive security mechanisms;security policy","","0","","","","","14-15 Nov. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time. The monitor has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 based ML506 board and verified in hardware using real Internet traffic traces.

This paper concerns using rough set for attribution ranking and reducing and using support vector machine for intrusion detection classification. An elicitation attribution reduction algorithm (EARA) based on attribution significance and discernibility matrix is presented and three data discretization algorithms were applied to identify the important attributions. The classification performance of the presented algorithm and classical SVM were compared in accuracy, time, false positive rate, and detection rate.

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks.

Industry and academies adopt the network security enabled hypervisor (NSE-H) to protect virtual machines (VM) residing in the virtual network. In this paper, we identified the insufficiency of the existing live migration implementation, which prevents itself from providing transparent VM relocation between NSE-Hs. This occurs because the contemporary migration implementation only takes VM encapsulated states into account, but ignores VM related security context(SC) needed by NSE-H embedded security engines (SE). We presented a comprehensive live migration framework for the NSE-H, considering both the execution context encapsulated in VM instance and the VM related security context within the SEs. We built a prototype system of the framework based on stateful firewall enabled Xen hypervisor. Our experiment was performed with realistic applications and the results demonstrate that the solution complements the insufficiency without introducing significant performance downgrade. Even in the worst case, the downtime that occurs during migration increases no more than 15%, comparing to existing implementation.","","978-1-4244-4590-5","978-1-4244-4591-2","10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5347800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5347800","hypervisor;live migration;network security;virtualization","Computer networks;Engines;Hardware;Platform virtualization;Protection;Resource virtualization;Space technology;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing","authorisation;computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","NSE-H;SE;VM execution context encapsulation;contemporary migration framework;efficiency 15 percent;embedded security engine;multiple operating system;network security enhanced hypervisor;network-base security device;prototype system;stateful firewall enabled Xen hypervisor;system virtualization technology;transparent VM relocation;virtual computing environment;virtual machine live migration","","4","1","21","","","18-20 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","INFOCOM, 2011 Proceedings IEEE","20110630","2011","","","1853","1861","Regular expression matching (REM) with nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) can be computationally expensive when a large number of patterns are matched concurrently. On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986","Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching","NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","","11","","26","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Safe operations can be enhanced by correctly designed device-level control algorithms as well as protocols, procedures, and operator training at the control-room level, but all of these can fail. Moreover, these elements exchange data and issue commands via vulnerable communication layers. To secure these gaps and enhance operational safety, the authors believe command sequence monitoring must be combined with an awareness of physical device limitations and automata models that capture safety mechanisms. One way of doing this is by leveraging specification-based intrusion detection to monitor for physical constraint violations. This method can also verify that the physical infrastructure state is consistent with information and commands exchanged by controllers. This additional security layer enhances protection from both outsider attacks and insider mistakes.","1540-7993","","","10.1109/MSP.2014.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006406","cyber-physical system;energy system;intrusion detection;physics;safety engineering;security;specifications","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Control systems;Energy management;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Safety;Safety devices","control facilities;networked control systems;security of data","command sequence monitoring;control centers;correctly designed device-level control algorithms;embedded controllers;networked control system security monitoring;operations safety;physical device safety;security layer;specification-based intrusion detection;vulnerable communication layers","","0","","17","","","Nov.-Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It acts as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) for the human body and detects anomalies that make the body deviate from its normal behavior. This inspired researchers to build artificial immune systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period. Although several AISes have been proposed, only a few make use of collaborative approaches. In this paper we propose P2P-AIS, a P2P approach for AISes in which peers exchange intrusion detection experience in order to enhance attack detection and mitigation. P2P-AIS implements Chord as a distributed hash table (DHT) protocol to organize the peers.","","978-1-4244-4623-0","978-1-4244-4624-7","10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5307053","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of service;intrusion detection;peer-to-peer systems","Artificial immune systems;Broadcasting;Computer crime;Computer science;Error correction;Floods;Humans;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols","artificial immune systems;cryptographic protocols;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Chord;DDoS flooding attacks;P2P-AIS;artificial immune system;distributed hash table protocol;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention system","","0","","20","","","23-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, MANET is venerable to attacks due to its mobile and ad hoc natures. The security issue is becoming a main concern in the applications of MANET. We consider the problem of decreasing the number of false positives generated by cooperative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, lightweight mobile agent as alternative to the client server distribution model and nonoverlapping zone framework. So it can effectively detect complicated attacks. The data collection, data analysis, alert message and alarm message can be achieved by using mobile agents, which may reduce the data transmission to save the bandwidth resource in the MANET. The model can adjust itself dynamically to adapt to the change of the external environmental. Also the model is robust and scalable.","","978-1-4244-2282-1","978-1-4244-2283-8","10.1109/CANET.2008.4655310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4655310","","Communication system security;Data analysis;Data communication;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Network servers;Packet radio networks;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;security of data","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile agent intrusion detection system;multi-hop packet radio network","","1","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist. In this paper, we address the challenges of determining and detecting unauthorized access to data stored in MapReduce based cloud environments.

The solution is API-hook-based, which does not require compiler extensions or operating system kernel patches. Unlike other API-hook-based solutions, which will not discover that system calls are actually invoked by malicious code in certain cases, AIFD works well in those cases. By it, programs protected will not yield control to the exploitation code, but rather enter a fail-safe state.

First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore, it leverages information in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for mandatory integrity protection.

Actually, their salient features, essentially the absence of infrastructure and auto-management, promise huge applications and possibilities for wireless communication. However, the tremendous boom of these networks depends incontestably on their reliability in terms of security and quality of services (QoS). In this paper, we study the ad hoc security vulnerabilities for which cryptographic-based solutions are ineffective and which require IDS. Appropriate designed IDS services appear essential as countermeasures to those threats, where previous IDS proposals often seem to be too sophisticated in the ad hoc environment and merely ineffective. Our goal here is to provide an IDS mechanism dedicated to the OLSR protocol, fitting to its characteristics and operation, and designed to avoid its vulnerabilities. Hence, our proposed IDS represents an urgent and primary line of defense since it protects from the protocol flaws themselves avoiding a significant panoply of easily operated attacks.","1525-3511","1-4244-0658-7","1-4244-0659-5","10.1109/WCNC.2007.487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4224732","","Ad hoc networks;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Defense industry;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Protection;Quality of service;Telecommunication network reliability;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;security of data","IDS services;OLSR protocol;ad hoc networks;quality of services;security services","","1","","12","","","11-15 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because malicious attackers may try to hide their presence from a health monitor, such monitoring has to be fine-grained - we will argue that individual instructions in the binary executable code should be monitored. This can be prohibitively expensive, but it may be possible to use static verification technology to reduce the workload of the health monitor.

The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography. We evaluate the performance of our approach in real testbeds, compare it with state-of-the-art protocols, and show that this approach enables efficient and reliable wireless reprogramming.","","978-1-4673-1543-2","","10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289278","","Cryptography;Payloads;Protocols;Reliability;Unicast;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","OTAP protocol;SenSeOP;WSN applications;asymmetric cryptography;efficient wireless reprogramming;location dependency;malicious reprogramming attempts;network-wide dissemination;reliable wireless reprogramming;secure over-the-air programming;selective over-the-air programming;sensing task diversity;sensor hardware heterogeneity;sensor nodes;unauthorized reprogramming attempts;wireless sensor networks","","1","","22","","","July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a high throughput configurable string matching architecture based on Aho-Corasick algorithm. The architecture can be realized by random-access memory (RAM) and basic logic elements instead of designing new dedicated chips. The bit-split technique is used to reduce the RAM size, and the byte-parallel technique is used to boost the throughput of the architecture. By the particular design and comprehensive experiments with 100 MHz RAM chips, one piece of the architecture can achieve a throughput of up to 1.6 Gbps by 2-byte-parallel input, and we can further boost the throughput by using multiple parallel architectures.","","978-1-4244-5218-7","978-1-4244-5219-4","10.1109/CYBERC.2009.5342207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342207","finite state machine;information retrieval;parallel hardware architecture;string matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer architecture;Hardware;Logic design;Parallel architectures;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Reduced instruction set computing;Throughput","finite state machines;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;random-access storage;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;RAM chip;RAM size;bit-split byte-parallel string matching architecture;finite state machine;frequency 100 MHz;logic element;parallel architecture;random-access memory","","0","","9","","","10-11 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques. The results show that our technique yields fewer false alarms and can handle large traces with smaller (or comparable) processing times compared against the existing techniques for the host based anomaly intrusion detection systems.","","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698896","Host-based Intrusion Detection System;Software Reliability;Software Security","File systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Training","Linux;probability;security of data","Firefox dataset;Linux based program;UNM datasets;anomalous trace;anomaly identification;contemporary test suites;hacking technique;host based anomaly intrusion detection approach;kernel module state;normal trace;state interaction analysis;state occurrence probability;system behaviour visual understanding;system call representation;system call semantic interaction","","2","","38","","","4-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection system that fails to perform packet inspection at high rate will allow malicious packets to enter the network undetected. In this paper we demonstrate that the current default configuration of the Linux networking subsystem (a.k.a. NAPI) is not suitable for Snort's performance. We show that the performance of Snort can be improved significantly by tuning certain configuration parameters. In particular, we experimentally study the performance impact of choosing different NAPI budget values on Snort's throughput.

However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.","1063-6706","","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229","Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning","computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning","","5","","34","","2010-05-20","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE Symposium on","20080528","2008","","","187","201","Automata-based representations and related algorithms have been applied to address several problems in information security, and often the automata had to be augmented with additional information. For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3168-7","","10.1109/SP.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153","finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata","extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity","","35","3","33","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis.

This system detects known attacks through signature matching and reveals network anomalies by Internet traffic data mining. The CAIDS design integrates two different detection engines for alert correlation between intrusions and anomalies. We aim to automate signature generation into Snort database. The system was tested over an Internet trace of 24 millions of packets containing 200 attacks. Our simulation experiments result in a 75% detection rate on all attacks with a low 5% false alarm rate.

We discuss these experimental results and also identify open problems in applying formal methods more generally in the context of worm quarantine research","","1-4244-0198-4","","10.1109/.2006.1629456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629456","","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Filtering;International collaboration;Internet;Laboratories;Optical propagation;Protection","formal specification;formal verification;invasive software;local area networks;telecommunication security","LAN;collaborative worm defense;defense-aware worm behavior;model checking;worm propagation sequences;worm quarantine research","","2","","24","","","10-12 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 23rd IEEE International Symposium on","20041108","2004","","","195","204","The paper proposes a combined hardware/software approach for realizing high performance, intrusion- and fault-tolerant services. The approach is demonstrated for (yet not limited to) an attribute authority server, which provides a compelling application due to its stringent performance and security requirements. The key element of the proposed architecture is an FPGA-based, parallel crypto-engine providing (1) optimally dimensioned RSA Processors for efficient execution of computationally intensive RSA signatures and (2) a KeyStore facility used as tamper-resistant storage for preserving secret keys. To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography). Resulting replicated systems that exhibit nondeterministic behavior, which cannot be handled with conventional replication approaches. Our architecture is based on a preemptive deterministic scheduling algorithm to govern scheduling of replica threads and guarantee strong replica consistency.","1060-9857","0-7695-2239-4","","10.1109/RELDIS.2004.1353020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353020","","Application software;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Cryptography;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Processor scheduling;Software performance;System recovery","authorisation;cryptography;digital signatures;fault tolerant computing;hardware-software codesign;program verification;scheduling;software architecture","FPGA-based parallel crypto-engine;KeyStore facility;Spin model checker;active replication;attached parallel crypto-engine;attribute authority partial signature;attribute authority server;computationally intensive RSA signature;formal modeling;hardware-software approach;high performance fault-tolerant service;high performance fault-tolerant system;high performance intrusion-tolerant service;high performance intrusion-tolerant system;optimally dimensioned RSA Processor;preemptive deterministic scheduling;replica consistency;replica threads;replicated system;security requirement;tamper-resistant storage;threshold cryptography","","2","3","37","","","18-20 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the rough set theory has been applied to the intrusion detection. An effective method based rough set for anomaly intrusion detection with low overhead and high efficiency has been presented. The method is based on Rough Set Theory to extract a set of detection rules with a minimal size as the normal behavior model from the system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It is capable of detecting the abnormal operating status of a process and thus reporting a possible intrusion. This method requires a smaller size of training data set compared with other methods, less effort to collect training data and is more suitable for real-time detection. Experimental results show that this method is promising in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency.","","978-1-4244-2238-8","978-1-4244-2239-5","10.1109/ICWAPR.2008.4635880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4635880","Anomaly detection;Intrusion detection;Rough sets","Databases;Hidden Markov models;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Set theory;Training data;Wavelet analysis","rough set theory;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection method;pattern recognition;rough set theory;system call sequences","","0","","16","","","30-31 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to GPU's tremendous computing capability, it has emerged as the co-processor of CPU to achieve a high overall throughput. CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost. It also shows good scalability when varying the number of dimensions of the reference dataset, the number of objects in the reference dataset, and the number of objects in the query dataset.","","978-1-4244-6356-5","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607480","","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches;Programming","C language;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;optimisation;pattern classification","C language;CUDA optimization techniques;CUDA-enabled GPU;KNN;classification technique;coprocessor;graphics processing units;parallel implementation;parallel k-nearest neighbor algorithm;query dataset;text classification","","3","1","18","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A newly joined one is tested to obtain its key features' performance curves, which are used to balance detection workload among detectors. When a detector due to some reasons can not continue its detection leaving an unfinished task, FGIDS allocates another available one to take over.

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","","1-4244-0798-2","1-4244-0799-0","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Excellent regular expression engine used in DPI system must be fast, accuracy and less memory usage to match a large volume of data streams, especially in realtime network. In this paper, four open source regular expression match engines are introduced, include Henry Spencer's regex library, PCRE, RE2, and TRE. An evaluation of the four libraries on expressive power, data structure, memory usage and performance is proposed. The evaluation is based on analysis of their source code and black-box testing. Also a list of benchmarks is presented to do this evaluation. The results indicate that PCRE supports more features but has worse performance than other libraries, RE2 performs well on both time and memory usage but does not support backreferences. Both of them are more suitable for DPI system than TRE and Spency's library.","","978-1-61284-158-8","","10.1109/ICBNMT.2011.6155959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6155959","DPI system;Realization analysis;Regular expression match engine","Benchmark testing;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Libraries;Memory management;Pattern matching","computer network security","DPI system;Henry Spencer regex library;PCRE;RE2;TRE;black-box testing;data streams;data structure;deep packet inspection system;expressive power;intrusion detection system;memory performance;memory usage;realtime network;regular expression match engine evaluation;source code","","0","","14","","","28-30 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Ultra-high throughput string matching for Deep Packet Inspection","Kennedy, A.; Xiaojun Wang; Zhen Liu; Bin Liu","Sch. of Electron. Eng., Dublin City Univ., Dublin, Ireland","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2010","20100429","2010","","","399","404","Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) involves searching a packet's header and payload against thousands of rules to detect possible attacks. The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching","","0","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
