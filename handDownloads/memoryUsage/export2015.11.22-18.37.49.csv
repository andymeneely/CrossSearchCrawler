The framework enables researchers to collect malware samples for analysis continuously, to develop counter measures and to generate pattern signatures for detection. By using this framework security analysts and operators are able to minimize their workload. Five components of malware collection unit, malware database, dynamic analysis unit, static analysis unit, signature generation and response unit have been developed and with certain level of manual operation these units are functional and are able to reduce workload of analysts for counter malware activities. Functionality to manage resources for integrated units such as virtual machines, virtual networks etc is being developed. Development of automated generation of signature would be key for this solution. An approach which compare network traffic generated by machines with malicious executable running and innocent network traffic collected from network used in daily operation which is assumed not to include malicious traffic is proposed. Under the situation with increasing number of newly created malware development of automation and continuity of counter malware scheme has been significant issues.

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","978-1-4673-6239-9","978-0-7695-4952-1","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","1","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus in this paper the implementation of Winny packets detection unit in H-HIPS considering its importance. Although Winny is a useful file exchanging software, it is also a cause of information leakage. This is serious in view of especially corporation, government, and academic.

But current regular expression matching algorithms or architecture cannot provide a perfect solution for whole matching problem. In some real network security applications, exact strings are the biggest part of rule set, and the second part is simple regular expressions (dot-star and AND-logic), and the other complex regular expressions only occupy a very small part. So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly. Experiments with random test data and ClamAV rule set show that MSRM can achieve a high throughput of 2.1 and 2.8 Gbps using Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively which is much higher than software algorithms.","","978-1-4244-2682-9","978-1-4244-2683-6","10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625475","","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Coprocessors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Hardware;Impedance matching;Information security;Inspection;Pattern matching","computer architecture;coprocessors;logic gates","AND-logic;AND-logic regular expressions;RAM data;Virtex2 devices;Virtex4 devices;content inspection;dot-star;hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture;packet inspection coprocessor;pattern matching;software algorithms","","0","","26","","","4-6 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given that these systems can roam on multiple networks, with no guarantee on security adopted on each network, including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the mobile platforms can be beneficial in preventing cyber-attacks. One of the key problems with implementing IDS on mobile platforms is the increased power consumption. This paper presents low power circuits that implement the string matching tasks within the Snort IDS. These tasks can take up to 80% of the power consumed for Snort. The circuit presented is based on memristor crossbars and evaluate Snort rules at 0.013mW per signature. The circuits are easy to program, utilizing only two resistance states for the memristors. They are highly parallel and dense, utilizing a brute-force string matching algorithm.

This is emphasized by the fact that virtual machines are abruptly migrated between physical hosts, in the same or even in different data centers under different security policies. If security is not correctly enforced at the destination locations, and not properly updated in the source locations, security of the migrating virtual machine as well as the co-located machines can be compromised. In this paper, we intend to tackle this problem, specifically for intrusion detection/prevention and VPN/IPsec as main security mechanisms. More precisely, we propose a systematic verification approach to check the compliance of security configurations. To this end, we first elaborate on two properties, namely intrusion monitoring configuration preservation and VPN/IPsec protection configuration preservation. Then, we derive a set of formulas that compare security configurations before and after migration. This allows reasoning on whether the aforementioned security properties hold. To this end, we encode these formulas as constraint satisfaction problems. The obtained constraints are then submitted to a constraint solver, namely Sugar, in order to verify the properties and to pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903454","Cloud Computing;Intrusion Detection;Security;VPN/IPsec;Verification","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sugar;Virtual machining;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;computer centres;constraint satisfaction problems;security of data;virtual machines","VPN-IPsec protection configuration preservation;cloud computing;co-located machines;constraint satisfaction problems;data centers;intrusion monitoring configuration preservation;physical hosts;pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems;security configuration preservation;security mechanisms;security policies;security properties;systematic verification approach;virtual machines","","0","","26","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many improvements have been applied to this library but it still suffers from several performance flaws that are due not to the software itself but rather to the underlying hardware bottlenecks. In this paper we present a new traffic monitoring device, implemented by an Intel IXP2400 Network Processor PCI-X card connected to a gigabit Ethernet LAN hosting a cluster of common personal computers running any libpcap based application.

On the other hand, we are witnessing an increasing number of zero day attacks. Our analysis confirms that Local Area Networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks since there is free communication between the hosts in the LAN. A single compromised host can severely degrade the services in the traditional LAN and it is extremely difficult task for the security administrator to determine the compromised host that is generating attack traffic. In this paper we propose techniques to enhance the security in traditional LAN by making use of the trusted computing and virtualisation technologies. Often virtualisation is considered as a technology which enables to run multiple computers on a single server. We will show that virtualisation technology has significant benefits even if a single virtual machine is hosted on each VMM. Our model enables the security administrator to enforce security policies on the traffic that can be placed on the LAN medium. Hence our model efficiently deals with the attack at the VMM that is hosting the compromised virtual machine. The security can be enhanced furthermore by using the TPM technology to secure the virtualized local area networks. We will also present detail analysis of different cases scenarios on how the proposed model can enhance the security of the local area networks. There are several advantages with our model. Emerging attacks such as Conficker remain dormant in our proposed architecture in order to avoid detection. Hence our model can transform the highly vulnerable traditional LANs into trust enhanced and secure virtualized local area networks.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120871","Intrusion Detection;Local Area Networks;Trusted Computing;Virtual machine monitor;Zero Day Attacks","Hardware;Local area networks;Malware;Monitoring;Servers;Virtual machining","computer network security;local area networks;virtual machines","Conficker;TVLAN;VMM;detail analysis;security administrator;trusted and virtualised local area networks;trusted computing;virtual machine;virtualisation technology","","0","","21","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate the impact of live virtual-machine migration on state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) techniques (namely PCA and K-means), by evaluating live migration under various attack types and intensities.

For the ease of development, complex packet processing algorithms are often implemented at the user-space level. As a result, performance benchmarks for packet processing algorithms often show a great gap when packets are input from different sources. An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated. Experiments show that the proposed software architecture reduces 30% of CPU utilization.

Centralized access control determination fails to work in unstructured networks, as the information necessary for pre-configuration is not available. This situation is exacerbated by the dynamic nature of the environment's membership, so that the time and resources expended in off-line management are largely wasted. This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate potential associates for collaborative interaction. A distributed, node-centric approach to trust management processes behavior grades into a reputation that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations. The application of a reputation against a dynamic risk assessment gives a measure of expectation of a peer's behavior, based on past performance and current the network environment.

The paper focuses on the design aspects of such an intrusion detection system by integrating different artificial intelligence techniques and a mobile agent architecture. Specifically, IBM's Aglets (TM) Software Development Kit (ASDK) is used as the base agent architecture, along with adaptive resonance theory (ART-2) neural networks for network pattern classification, and a fuzzy logic controller for decision/action resolution.

Among variety of anomaly detection approaches, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) are known to be two of the best machine learning algorithms to classify normal from abnormal behaviors. In this paper a hybrid anomaly-based intrusion detection method is proposed that is based on these two methods. These methods are trained in supervised way. We use the following additional techniques to improve the performance of proposed approach: First, a feature selection technique using the entropy of features is used for extracting optimized information from KDD data set and second, a novel method is proposed to combine the results of these two learning based methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed hybrid approach by using the KDD dataset. The simulation results show that which features of KDD are better to distinguish the normal from abnormal traffics.

But, like most things in life, the benefits come with risks. It's just a matter of knowing if the benefits outweigh the risks and vice versa. Unfortunately, the cloud computing does not escape to this universal rule. Then, it is important to consider the security of the cloud. As a solution to protect the cloud from security issues [1, 2, 3, 4], we think that IDSs integrated in the cloud remains among the best solution. We will also present an architecture based IDS that respects multi-tenancy architecture. The objective behind integrating multi-tenancy aspect in our solution is to give tenants the ability to configure some parts of the application, such as the color of the user interface or business rules, but they can't customize the application's code. This means that although tenants an using the same building blocks in their configuration, the appearance or workflow of the application may be different for two tenants. Also, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of each tenant can differ. In fact, we contend that multi-tenancy is a requirement for any cloud architecture because of four key benefits. First, High security: there are 3 key components that define the degree of isolation between multiple tenants in a data center: access policies, application deployment and data access and protection. Second, Economy: software development and maintenance costs are shared between the tenants. Third, Service assurance and faster updates: with multi-tenancy, the provider has to make updates once. In contrast with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has their own software instance and may be given access to application code. Fourth, Efficiency and flexibility: A SaaS provider can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web access to multipl- customers. Each tenant's data is Isolated and remains invisible to other tenants [11].","","978-1-4799-0322-1","","10.1109/JNS3.2013.6595469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595469","cloud computing;cloud security;computer attacks;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;multi-tenancy;network attacks","Architecture;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Image color analysis;Reliability;Security","cloud computing;security of data;software engineering","SaaS provider;access policies;application deployment;cloud computing architectures based multitenant IDS;data access;data center;data protection;maintenance costs;multitenancy aspect;security issues;service assurance;service level agreement;software development","","0","","17","","","26-27 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Particular areas of concern are the deliberate and intended actions associated with malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, or the compromise of networks, communications or other IT resources, of which the most harmful and difficult to detect threats are those propagated by an insider. However, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information, such as what is found in document control and management systems, are limited in scope and capabilities. In order to address this issue, this effort involves performing further research and development on the existing graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) system. GBAD discovers anomalous instances of structural patterns in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. Input to GBAD is a labeled graph in which entities are represented by labeled vertices and relationships or actions are represented by labeled edges between entities. Using the minimum description length (MDL) principle to identify the normative pattern that minimizes the number of bits needed to describe the input graph after being compressed by the pattern, GBAD implements algorithms for identifying the three possible changes to a graph: modifications, insertions and deletions. Each algorithm discovers those substructures that match the closest to the normative pattern without matching exactly.","","978-0-7695-3568-5","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804450","","Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Pattern matching;Personnel;Terrorism","graph theory;pattern matching;security of data","insider threat detection;labeled graph-based anomaly detection system;labeled vertex;minimum description length principle;normative pattern matching;unauthorized access identification","","4","","8","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we focus the exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.15.4 low rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) MAC layer. This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior. Simulation results provide evidence the effectiveness for achieving detection of exhaustion attacks with improved detection rate.","2164-7143","978-1-4673-5117-1","","10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416593","DDoS;Detection;Exhaustion attacks;FLS;IEEE 802.15.4;MAC Layer;Security","Batteries;Fuzzy logic;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Security;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;computer network security;fuzzy logic;personal area networks","DDoS;IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer;LR-WPAN;communication capabilities;computation capabilities;detection mechanism;distributed denial of service;exhaustion attack detection;fuzzy logic system;low rate wireless personal area network;malicious attacks;security system;sensor power;sensory resources;untrusted environments","","0","","29","","","27-29 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Challenges proper of data validation in this domain include the possibility of expressing validation rules specific to an Advanced Metering Infrastructure installation and analysis techniques that cope with the large and fluctuating volume of data produced by the devices. In this paper, we discuss and provide evidence of the online, scalable and expressive validation analysis enabled by the data streaming processing paradigm.

"Reorganized and Compact DFA for Efficient Regular Expression Matching","Kai Wang; Yaxuan Qi; Yibo Xue; Jun Li","","Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on","20110728","2011","","","1","5","Regular expression matching has become a critical yet challenging technique in content-aware network processing, such as application identification and deep inspection. To meet the requirement for processing heavy network traffic at line rate, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is widely used to accelerate regular expression matching at the expense of large memory usage. In this paper, we propose a DFA-based algorithm named RCDFA (Reorganized and Compact DFA), which dramatically reduces the memory usage while maintaining fast and deterministic lookup speed. Based on the dissection of real-life DFA tables, we observe that almost every state has multiple similar states, i.e. they share identical next-state transitions for most input characters. However, these similar states often distribute at nonadjacent positions in the original DFA table. RCDFA aims at reorganizing all similar states into adjacent entries, so that identical transitions become consecutive along the state dimension, then compresses the reorganized DFA table utilizing bitmap technique. Coupled with mapping along the character dimension, RCDFA is not only efficient in DFA compression, but also effective for hardware implementation. Experiment results show, RCDFA has superior performance in terms of high processing speed, low memory usage and short preprocessing time. RCDFA consistently achieves over 95% compression ratio for existing real-life rule sets. Implemented in a single Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA platform, RCDFA matching engine achieved 12Gbps throughput.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5963291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963291","","Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Pattern matching;Throughput","computer networks;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;telecommunication traffic","Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA platform;bitmap technique;content aware network processing;deterministic finite automata;next state transitions;regular expression matching;reorganized and compact DFA","","3","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 3rd ACS/IEEE International Conference on","20050613","2005","","","98","","Summary form only given. In the current research, we present an operation framework and protection mechanism to facilitate a secure environment to protect mobile agents against tampering. The system depends on the presence of an authentication authority. The advantage of the proposed system is that security measures are an integral part of the design, thus common security retrofitting problems do not arise. This is due to the presence of the ElGamal encryption mechanism to protect its confidential content and any collected data by the agent from the visited host. Therefore, eavesdropping on information from the agent no longer reveals any confidential information. Also, the inherent security constraints within the framework allow the system to operate as an intrusion detection system for any mobile agent environment. The mechanism is tested for most well known severe attacks against agents and networked systems. The scheme proved to have promising performance that highly recommends it for the type of transactions that needs highly secure environments, e. g., business to business.","","0-7803-8735-X","","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387089","","Authentication;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Protection;Software agents;System testing","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile agents","ElGamal encryption mechanism;MANET;authentication authority;confidential information;highly secure environments;intrusion detection;mobile agent protection mechanism;secure environment;security constraints;security retrofitting problems","","1","5","18","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The outside attackers can be prevented with the help of an efficient key management protocol and cryptography. However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism. The protocol is storage scalable and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments.","1550-445X","978-1-4799-3629-8","","10.1109/AINA.2014.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838720","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Key Management;Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET);Secure Routing","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Mobile computing;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","MANET;broadcast key distribution mechanism;integrated localized key management protocol;intrusion detection system;key management protocol;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor based handshaking and least common multiple;public key cryptography;routing protocol;routing security","","1","","18","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once a computer is compromised, an attacker may alter files, add new files or delete existing files. The changes that attackers make may target any part of the filesystem, including metadata along with files (e.g., permissions, ownerships and inodes). The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that focused on filesystem attack activity after a SSH compromise. Three types of attacker action are considered: reconnaissance, password modification, and malware download.

As IDS traces monitor large groups of servers, large amounts of network data and also spanning a variety of patterns, efficient analytical approaches are needed to address this big heterogeneous data analysis problem. We believe that using unsupervised learning methods can help to classify data that allows analysts to find out meaningful insights and extract the value of the collected data more precisely and efficiently. This study demonstrates how the technique of growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM) can be utilized to facilitate efficient event data analysis. For the collected IDS traces, GHSOM is used to cluster data and reveal the geometric distances between each cluster in a topological space such that the attack signatures for each cluster can be easily identified. The experimental results from a real-world IDS traces show that our proposed approach can efficiently discover several critical attack patterns and significantly reduce the size of IDS trace log which needs to be further analyzed. The proposed approach can help internet security administrators/analysts to conduct network forensics analysis, discover suspicious attack sources, and set up recovery processes to prevent previously unknown security threats such as zero-day attacks.","","","","10.1109/BDCloud.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034762","cloud services;forensic analysis;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;internet security;intrusion detection system","Correlation;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;data analysis;digital signatures;pattern classification;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","GHSOM;IDS traces;Internet security administrators;Internet security analysts;analytical approach;attack signatures;cloud services;cluster geometric distances;complex data pattern parsing;critical attack patterns;data classification;data clustering;event data analysis;event pattern discovery;growing hierarchical self-organizing maps;heterogeneous data analysis problem;intrusion detection rule sets;intrusion detection system;network forensics analysis;recovery process;suspicious attack source discovery;topological space;unsupervised learning methods","","0","","22","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, etc.). This paper introduces proactive threat observatory system (PROTOS), an open-source early warning system that does not require a commercial license and is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet. The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs. SSLINT is capable of performing automatic logic verification with high efficiency and good accuracy. To demonstrate it, we apply SSLINT to one of the most popular Linux distributions -- Ubuntu.

This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected. This paper provides a complete description of a method to allow for better containment of this class of worms.

The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases. Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC. A pattern with distinct 16-byte prefix only occupies up to three lookup table entries in QSV. The overall memory cost of our system is about 1.4 Mbyte, i.e., 1.4 bit per character of the ClamAV pattern set.

So optimization methods using dynamic traffic characteristics are exploited. Our contributions lie in three folds. Firstly, a novel best classification tree is formally defined aiming to minimize the visit cost of the traffic in the slot, based on which optimization methods are exploited.

In this paper, we first propose an extension of an IDS based on information flow control. We address issues concerning programs execution and improve its expressiveness in terms of security policy. This extended model can be configured to reach a wide variety of different security goals. Particularly, it allows for information flow checking based on users and/or programs dependent policy rules. Furthermore, suspicious modification of binary programs can be detected to avoid malware execution. We also propose an algorithm for deriving an AppArmor MAC policy into an information flow policy, and thus get the advantage of having a ready to use policy offering good security. We finally show a practical example of deriving such a policy in order to configure our IDS.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5962660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962660","","Access control;Containers;Law;Linux;Operating systems","access protocols;invasive software;security of data;telecommunication congestion control","IDS;MAC implementation;MAC policy;binary program;custom policy;information flow checking;information flow control;information flow policy;intrusion detection;malware execution;program dependent policy rule;security goal;security policy","","5","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a new framework together with a set of paradigms for adaptive immune virtual layers implemented by multi-mobile agents based active monitoring of network systems is proposed. Multi-mobile agents combine features of adaptation, self defending and self monitoring of human immune system, that works in parallel with decentralizes control.

It is a form of computer network packet filtering that examines not only the header portion but also the payload part of a packet as it passes through an inspection point, searching for protocol noncompliance, viruses, Spam, intrusions or some predefined criteria to decide if the packet can pass it or it needs to be routed to a different destination. Most of the systems that perform deep packet inspection implement basic string matching algorithms to match packets against large but finite strings. However, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power. DFA is employed to implement regular expression matching. DFA representations of a regular expression sets in network applications require large amounts of memory, limiting their practical application. This paper presents an analysis of different compact representation of DFA such as D<sup>2</sup>FA, δFA, δ<sup>2</sup>FA.","","978-1-4673-3149-4","","10.1109/ICCCT.2012.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394708","DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Pattern matching","computer network security;computer viruses;finite automata;protocols;string matching;unsolicited e-mail","δ<sup>2</sup>FA;D<sup>2</sup>FA;DFA-based pattern matching;DPI;computer network packet filtering;deep packet inspection;delta finite automata;inspection point;intrusions;network security applications;protocol noncompliance searching;regular expression-based pattern matching;spam;string matching algorithms;virus","","1","","17","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As underlying devices in SDN, SDN switches must maintain a large number of hardware counters. Implementation of these counters faces serious challenges for SDN switches, i.e., High memory consumption and inflexibility. Thus, we previously proposed Software Defined Hardware Counters (SDHC), which decouples definition and implementation of counters to overcome these challenges. However, like traditional hardware counters, SDHC only supports passive statistical mode (i.e., The values of the counters can be only read passively by the controller). Based on the passive mode, most of applications need to send request messages at some frequency to obtain statistics, which causes some critical problems for SDN: i) low statistical accuracy, ii) high network bandwidth consumption. Hyper Software Defined Hardware Counters (Hyper SDHC) is thus proposed by extending SDHC. Through introducing the timer-triggering and updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms, Hyper SDHC can naturally support active statistical mode, i.e., Counters actively report their values according to triggering condition. It can greatly enhance the statistical accuracy and reduce network bandwidth consumption between controller and switch. The demo of Hyper SDHC is implemented based on Net Magic platform. The demo will exhibit how Hyper SDHC works and how it supports a typical video quality monitor application.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037744","Software Defined Networking (SDN);active statistical mode;counters","Bandwidth;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Software;Switches","software defined networking;statistical analysis","Net Magic platform;SDHC;SDN switches;hyper software defined hardware counters;low statistical accuracy;network bandwidth consumption;software defined networking;timer-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms;updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms","","0","","8","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

Moreover, most applications of IMDs require protection against injection or modification of disseminated measurements.

T2 FL is an extension of Type-1 FL which proved to be successful in modeling and minimizing the effects of various kinds of dynamic uncertainties. In this paper, T2 FL provides a basis for robust anomaly detection and cyber security state awareness. In addition, the proposed algorithm was specifically developed to comply with the constrained computational requirements of low-cost embedded network security cyber sensors.

The big data processing is done through HAMR, which is a next generation in-memory MapReduce engine. HAMR has reported high speedups over existing big data solutions across several analytics algorithms. The analytics engine comprises a novel ensemble algorithm, which extracts training data from clusters of the multiple IDS alarms. The clustering is utilized as a preprocessing step to re-label the datasets based on their high similarity to known potential attacks.

IEEE","20070529","2007","","","1289","1297","Third generation (3G) wireless networks based on the CDMA2000 and UMTS standards are now increasingly being deployed throughout the world. Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","18","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
