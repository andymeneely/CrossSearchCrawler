Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time, it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as “1” and the other is marked as “0.” During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2264537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584806","Dynamic secret-based encryption;ZigBee;retransmission;security;smart grid;wireless communication","Encryption;Monitoring;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Zigbee;cryptography;power system security;smart power grids","ZigBee protocol;dynamic encryption key;dynamic secret;encryption scheme;power system;retransmission sequence;security problems;shared communication medium;smart grid wireless communication","","3","","29","","2013-08-22","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We present a new approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for detecting the presence of computer worms based on the computer's behavioral measures. In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms. In addition, ANN may be used to identify the most relevant, measurable, features and thus reduce the feature dimensionality.","","0-7803-9490-9","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716409","","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Classification tree analysis;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer worms;Laboratories;Magnetic heads;Software tools","decision trees;invasive software;neural nets;pattern classification","artificial neural networks;classifications techniques;computer worm detection;decision tree;k-nearest neighbors","","2","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) that automatically generate and apply protection to client systems have been proposed as a solution. Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks. Our prototype also avoids a lot of practical problems faced by many other IPSs","","0-7695-2564-4","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609996","","Computer worms;Concrete;Contracts;Detectors;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Prototypes;Testing","security of data","LAIDS/LIDS framework;Lazy Shepherding IPS;client systems;intrusion prevention systems","","0","","17","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We discuss a detailed threat model to mobile devices in the real world to develop an ACM fitted to mobile devices. Then, we propose a novel multi-layer access control mechanism for mobile devices, which provides strong protection against the identified mobile threats as well as performance efficiency. Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","","978-1-4244-1456-7","978-1-4244-1457-4","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach therein proposed is based on the construction of an iterative map, whose computation is centralized and guaranteed under suitable conditions on the input visibility and graph connectivity. Under the same conditions, we extend the approach in this work by allowing the construction of a logical linear consensus system that is globally stable in a fully distributed way.

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","978-0-7695-3501-2","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","2","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MSMD incorporates an artificial danger model - based on the danger model in immunology - which selectively responds to unexpected behaviors of resources and applications, in order to increase fault-tolerance.

Given the speed with which new technologies are introduced in the Web environment, system deployment life cycles have shrunk significantly-but so have system life spans. After only a few years, an organization's Internet infrastructure is likely to need a major overhaul. In late 2001, the systems architecture team to which I belong took on these issues for an organization that wanted to rebuild its Web infrastructure. The existing infrastructure contained multiple single points of failure, could not scale to expected usage patterns, was built on proprietary systems, and had a high management overhead. The legacy infrastructure had grown organically over the previous five years as administrators added unplanned features and functionality, and usage had grown 100-fold since the specifications were initially developed. Because of the age and condition of the legacy systems, we decided to redesign the solution from scratch to overcome the inherent limitations. This case study describes the process our systems architecture team followed for designing and deploying the new architecture. I detail the component selection rationale, with implementation details where allowed. Ours is just one successful approach to deploying a. multisite, fully redundant Web-based system for a large organization; other reasonable and viable ways to build such a system also exist.","1089-7801","","","10.1109/MIC.2002.1036039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036039","","Added delay;Application software;Buildings;Computer architecture;Costs;Internet;Open source software;Programming;Service oriented architecture;Software systems","Internet;management of change;systems re-engineering","Web infrastructure;component selection;multisite fully redundant Web-based system;systems architecture","","0","1","8","","","Sep/Oct 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to delete the redundant and noisy features, improve the performance of IDS, we present an efficient IDS based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) method. Kernel methods are the effective approaches to intrusion detection problems. MKL methods combined with support vector machines (SVMs) can overcome some practice difficulties of IDS such as irregular data, non-flat distribution of the samples, etc. Experiments on the KDD Cup (1999) intrusion detection data set show that MKL methods have a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate compared to single kernel methods.","","978-1-4244-6791-4","","10.1109/ISKE.2010.5680860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680860","Intrusion Detection System;feature selection;kernel method;multiple kernel learning;support vector machine","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","SVM;data representation;intrusion detection system;kernel learning method;network anomaly detection;support vector machines","","1","","10","","","15-16 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative game between an attacker and a HIDS. The solution leads the HIDS to find the optimal number of objects that should be monitored and the corresponding monitored time. We study the case of multiple-step attack to gain more insight of the solution for this game model. Therefore, our model considers the tradeoff between the detection accuracy and the resource consumption. Analysis and simulation results prove that our approach can effectively decrease the resource consumption of the HIDS taking into consideration the detection accuracy.","","978-0-7695-3393-3","978-0-7695-3393-3","10.1109/WiMob.2008.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654280","Game theory;Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems;resources consumption","Analytical models;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Probes;Systems engineering and theory","game theory;security of data","HIDS;game theoretic approach;host-based intrusion detection system;multiple-step attack;resource consumption","","1","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic. The memory overhead added by the algorithm was limited to 0.11%.","","978-1-4577-1125-1","","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088148","Bloom filters;Snort;intrusion detection;network security;pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Pulse width modulation;Vectors","pattern matching;security of data","Exscind algorithm;Wu-Manber pattern matching;exclusion filter;inclusion filter;signature-based intrusion detection systems;software-based pattern matching","","1","","28","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose a method that explores transmission vulnerabilities of the encrypted traffic allowing its detection. Hence, an experimental test bed was created to capture a diversity of traffic, which includes flows of a widely used P2P media streaming application called Goal Bit.

The complexity of the method to analyze these relationships, the time to complete the analysis, the robustness and trustworthiness of the method are important features to be considered. In this paper, we propose using Extended Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (E-FCMs) to analyze the relationships between risk factors and risks, and adopting a pessimistic approach to assess the overall risk of a system or a project. E-FCMs are suggested by Hagiwara to represent causal relationships more naturally. The main differences between E-FCMs and conventional Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are the following: E-FCMs have nonlinear membership functions, conditional weights, and time delay weights. Therefore E-FCMs are suitable for risk analysis as all features of E-FCMs are more informative and can fit the needs of Risk Analysis. In this paper we suggest a framework to analyze risks using E-FCMs and extend E-FCMs themselves by introducing a special graphical representation for risk analysis.

By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity.

Meanwhile, modern multicore platforms are becoming performance competitive with traditional hardware solutions for PM. But due to the unbalance of network flow sizes, traditional flow- based data parallel processing/programming model can not fully exert multicore platforms' computing power and results in poor performance scalability. In this paper, a novel parallel inspection model, Dynamic Differentiated Distributed Detection (D<sup>4</sup>) is proposed. D<sup>4</sup> deploys distributed parallel operations by adding one more dimension on workload partition/allocation. It proposes an effective and efficient scheme to pre-partition the pattern set in several candidate ways, called ""Detection Modes"", and let multiple candidate PM methods to handle the subsets, respectively; the most suitable Detection Mode would be selected specifically for each incoming flows at the run-time, and the workload would be dynamically allocated among multiple CPU cores. Experimental results on real-world pattern set and traffic traces show that D<sup>4</sup> scales much better than traditional schemes by better balancing the load among the processors while avoiding unnecessary overheads.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698165","","Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Data flow computing;Hardware;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Pattern matching","parallel algorithms;pattern matching;resource allocation;security of data","Internet;dynamic differentiated distributed detection;multicore platform;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;network packet flow;parallel inspection model;pattern matching","","1","","14","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Almost all proposed cloud security models suffers from this problem in that these models have very limited control over virtualization. In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS. To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar model or implementation like HSVM, able to protect the cloud from DDoS attack, unauthorized access, data leakage as well.","","978-1-4673-1425-1","","10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246117","Cloud computing;Virtual Machine;Virtual Machine Monitor;intrusion detection system;secure virtualication;security","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","Web services;cloud computing;security of data","DDoS attack;HSVM;IaaS;PaaS;SaaS;cloud computing;cloud security models;cloud service models;cloud vendor control level;cyber attacks;dSaaS;data leakage;data storage as a service;guest OS;hierarchical secure virtualization model;host OS;infrastructure as a service;on-demand resources;platform as a service;service as a software;threat quarantine;unauthorized access","","1","","25","","","26-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in SnortÂ¿s ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets. Experimental results using a live system show that an attacker needs only 4.0 kbps of bandwidth to perpetually disable an unmodified NIDS, whereas all intrusions are detected when our countermeasure is used.","1063-9527","0-7695-2716-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041157","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Counting circuits;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Wire","","","","13","1","26","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because on-demand service provisioning for applications and data will be used by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of users simultaneously, a successful intrusion would not only expose sensitive data, but it could also completely cut users off from both applications and/or data. This paper examines the underlying security risks inherent to the CC paradigm, compares approaches to mitigate known security risks, and offers a solution that leverages intelligent multi-agent systems and network data ontologies to provide automated defense for both known and unknown malware security risks.

In this paper, we propose a regex pattern grouping scheme based on a new DFA model called Pattern-Based DFA (P-DFA) which supports efficient pattern-based op-erations, such as insertion, deletion, and etc. By using these basic operations, one can easily measure the state explo-sion when combining a set of regex patterns into a single DFA.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server. The results of the search techniques are compared to two hand-crafted solutions specified by experts.","","978-1-4244-8341-9","","10.1109/SSBSE.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635154","autonomic computing;genetic algorithms;genetic programming;search based software engineering","Biological cells;Libraries;Monitoring;Phase measurement;Sensors;Software","fault tolerant computing;genetic algorithms;search problems","autonomic system;convex-hull geometric object;fault detection;genetic-algorithm;genetic-programming;multidimensional space;random-search approach;search method;software sensor","","2","","25","","","7-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the ""Search"" phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.","","978-0-7695-2858-9","","10.1109/ICNS.2007.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321","","Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system","","0","","15","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron. This approach also exhibits a lower false alarm rate when detects novel attacks. The simulation tests are conducted using DARPA 1998 dataset.

Support vector machine (SVM) has been employed to provide potential solutions for the IDSs problem. However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

Thus, logs are not considered as evidence to prove the damage. In that case, digital evidence lacks in terms of completeness which makes it difficult to perform computer forensics operations. In order to maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later forensic procedures and intrusion detection, the study applies concepts of steganography to logs forensics, for which even intrusion altered records will be kept as well.

In this paper we propose a distributed IDS that performs both data capturing and data analyzing in a distributed fashion. This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment. Then we compared our proposed system with a centralized IDS in terms of detection rate, memory usage and packet loss rate. Results showed that our system's performance was better despite of some extra load imposed by distribution of data processing.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767356","Centralized IDS;DARPA 1999;Distributed IDS;Intrusion detection system;NS2 simulator;Nmap;Scan attack","Computer architecture;Computers;Data processing;Distributed databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","NS2 simulation environment;centralized IDS;computer networks;data capturie;data sharing mechanism;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion detection system;grouping mechanism;high traffic rate networks;large scale networks;network attacks;network traffic;packet loss rate","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new vaccine is evaluated by Blaster, Nachi and Sasser worm. It shows that the proposed vaccine reduces the release time up to 71% and is applied to worm vaccination successfully.","","978-1-4244-8432-4","","10.1109/AICI.2010.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655626","Generation;Internet worm;Structure;Vaccine;Worm vaccination","Computational modeling;Computers;Conferences;Decoding;Grippers;Internet;Vaccines","Internet;invasive software","Blaster worm;Internet worm;Nachi worm;Sasser worm;active counter-attack mechanism;worm vaccination","","0","","7","","","23-24 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Optimal Filtering of Source Address Prefixes: Models and Algorithms","Soldo, F.; Markopoulou, A.; Argyraki, K.","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA","INFOCOM 2009, IEEE","20090602","2009","","","2446","2454","How can we protect the network infrastructure from malicious traffic, such as scanning, malicious code propagation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks? One mechanism for blocking malicious traffic is filtering: access control lists (ACLs) can selectively block traffic based on fields of the IP header. Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a scarce resource because they are stored in expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying filter selection as a resource allocation problem. Within this framework, we study four practical cases of source address/prefix filtering, which correspond to different attack scenarios and operator's policies. We show that filter selection optimization leads to novel variations of the multidimensional knapsack problem and we design optimal, yet computationally efficient, algorithms to solve them. We also evaluate our approach using data from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it brings significant benefits in practice. Our set of algorithms is a building block that can be immediately used by operators and manufacturers to block malicious traffic in a cost-efficient way.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062172","","Access control;Associative memory;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Design optimization;Filtering algorithms;Filters;Protection;Resource management;Traffic control","IP networks;content-addressable storage;knapsack problems;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","IP header;access control lists;distributed denial-of-service attacks;filter selection optimization;malicious code propagation attacks;malicious traffic;multidimensional knapsack problem;network infrastructure protection;optimal filtering;resource allocation problem;routers;scanning attacks;source address prefixes;ternary content addressable memory","","7","","21","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"SAW: Java Synchronization Selection from Lock or Software Transactional Memory","Yamada, Y.; Iwasaki, H.; Ugawa, T.","Dept. of Comput.

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097","978-1-4577-1875-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We regard different program behavior models used to perform intrusion detection as different abstractions of the concrete trace semantics of programs. Based on this point, we formally define model-based intrusion detection and present a generic generation algorithm for program models on a provided abstraction domain. Eventually, we discuss how to use this mechanism to implement a real intrusion detection model proposed by us before.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598041","abstract interpretation;intrusion detection;static analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Concrete;Intrusion detection;Registers;Semantics","security of data","abstract interpretation;generic generation algorithm;model based intrusion detection;runtime behavior process","","0","","7","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the sensor nodes are usually deployed in places where there is no human surveillance, these networks are highly vulnerable to various security threats. The memory, power and processing constraints of the sensor nodes pose challenges to developing efficient security algorithms. Although many cryptographic techniques have been proposed to mitigate outside attacks, the securing of networks against inside attacks has not been addressed effectively. In this paper, a novel security system has been proposed to address the overall security requirement for Wireless Sensor Networks. Defense against outside attacks is provided using a cluster-based authentication and key management scheme using Elliptic Curve Cryptography, while inside attacks are taken care by a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System using Bayesian probabilistic model for decision making. The simulation results show the overall effectiveness of the proposed scheme, revealing better performance in terms of resilience to outside attacks, memory capacity, energy efficiency and false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324468","","Authentication;Bayes methods;Decision making;Elliptic curve cryptography;Intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","4-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, several anomaly detection techniques were proposed to detect malicious nodes using static and dynamic baseline profiles, which depict normal MANET behaviors. In this research, we investigated different baseline profile methods and conducted a set of experiments to evaluate their effectiveness and efficiency for anomaly detection in MANETs using C-means clustering technique. The results indicated that a static baseline profile delivers similar results to other baseline profile methods. However, it requires the least resource usage while a dynamic baseline profile method requires the most resource usage of all the baseline models.","","","","10.1109/SECON.2015.7133013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133013","Mobile ad hoc networks;anomaly detection;baseline profile;clustering technique;unsupervised learning techniques","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Mobile computing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;pattern clustering;security of data","MANET behaviors;c-means clustering technique;dynamic baseline profiles;intrusion detection;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;resource usage;static baseline profiles","","0","","13","","","9-12 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After analyzing the existing algorithms of security events correlation, we propose an attack scenario reconstruction technology based on state machine. The processes of attackers intruding into the cyberspace can be restored and the more comprehensive attack scenario description information will be generated using this technology. This working lets the security manager more comfy. The state machine based attack scenario reconstruction technology processes security events using clustering analysis and causal analysis concurrently, it builds a correlation state machine in memory for every attack scenario tree which is predefined by the security manager, when security events are coming, the current state set of the correlation state machine will process them, if the condition is satisfied, the current states of the state machine will transfer, it corresponds to the developing of the multi-step attack. If one of the leaf nodes of the state machine is in its current state set, an attack scenario description information will be generated and then sent to the security manager. The correlating technology based on state machine is more timely and accurately, and at last, we use the DARPA2000 Intrusion Scenario Specific Data Sets to validate the technology, the experiment results show that it is feasible to analyze security events using the technology we proposed.","","978-1-4244-5537-9","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563843","attack scenario reconstruction;attack scenario tree;causal analysis;clustering analysis;correlating state machine","Computational modeling;Computers;Correlation;Security;XML","computer network security;correlation methods;finite state machines;pattern clustering","DARPA2000 intrusion scenario specific data sets;attack scenario reconstruction technology;clustering analysis;correlation state machine;cyberspace;security devices;security events correlation;state machine","","1","","13","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
