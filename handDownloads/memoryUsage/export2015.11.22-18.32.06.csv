Various approaches have been applied in past that are less effective to curb the menace of intrusion. The purpose of this paper is to provide an intrusion detection system (IDS), by modifying the genetic algorithm to network intrusion detection system. As we have applied attribute subset reduction on the basis of Information gain. So the training time and complexity reduced considerably. Moreover, we embedded a soft computing approach in rule generation makes the rule more efficient than hard computing approach used in existing genetic algorithm. Generated rule can detect attack with more efficiency. This model was verified using KDD'99 data set. Empirical result clearly shows the higher detection rates and low false positive rates.","","978-1-4799-6928-9","","10.1109/CICN.2014.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065598","Detection rate (DR);False Positive (FP);Genetic algorithm (GA);Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Neural network Intrusion detection system (NNIDS)","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Statistics;Training","genetic algorithms;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","attribute subset reduction;genetic algorithm;information integrity maintenance;network intrusion detection system;rule generation;security constraints;soft computing approach","","0","","9","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH. Moreover, the additional storage requirement of the technique requires only 4KB additional information per connection as compared to 8KB of ACCH.","","978-1-4244-8454-6","978-1-4244-8455-3","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986030","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Huffman coding;Inspection;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;cellular radio;data compression;hypermedia;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH algorithm;DFA- based Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;SPC;Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm;compressed Web traffic;concurrent connection;content based networking device;real security device signature;shift-based pattern matching;standard GZIP;storage requirement;wireless Web device","","2","","25","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV. This mechanism is enhancement of Adaptive Acknowledgement (AACK) and TWO-ACK, here we have tried to show the efficiency increment by decreasing number of messages routed in the network.","","978-1-4799-3078-4","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968417","Ad-hoc network;Black Hole;MANET;Permutation;Security","Bandwidth;Decision support systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV;MANET;TWO-ACK;adaptive acknowledgement;black hole attack detection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc network;permutation based acknowledgement;reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;wireless links","","0","","15","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the security threats faced by the web lets during their migration between the cloud and the mobile devices. Web let migration is an important task during the implementation of elasticity in the cloud. As a primary step, a secure communication channel is designed for the web let migration by deploying secure shell protocol. Herein, the vulnerabilities in some authentication mechanisms are highlighted and a better way of authenticating the web lets with SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is suggested.

A recently developed hypothesis in immunology, the Danger Theory, states that our immune system responds to the presence of intruders through sensing molecules belonging to those invaders, plus signals generated by the host indicating danger and damage. Integrating the ldquoDanger Theoryrdquo, negative selection and immune memory, the paper proposes a novel artificial immune model for intrusion detection. The paper considers the coordination of DCs in the innate immune system and T cells in the adaptive immune system. At the same time the paper focuses on how to define ldquodanger signalsrdquo and considers whether to have a danger to the protected system as the basis of defining ldquoself-nonselfrdquo, in which the self is dynamically updated. The theory analysis shows that the dynamic self can improve the problem of error detection rate increasing sharply, and the dual detection method of DCs detecting the behaviors of antigens and T cells detecting the antigens can also significantly decrease error detection rate.","","978-0-7695-3490-9","","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756899","","Application software;Change detection algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer industry;Conferences;Distributed control;Immune system;Industrial training;Intrusion detection;Protection","artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence;genetic algorithms;security of data","adaptive immune system;artificial immune model;danger theory;error detection rate problem;intrusion detection model","","2","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this task may be difficult to achieve, namely for networks operating at very high-speed bit rates and low latency and/or when the traffic is encrypted.

Applications of artificial neural networks to characterize the behavior of users have been well studied in the recent past, without considering the enormous time they take to get modeled.

RIDS is a session oriented, statistical tool, that relies on training to mold the parameters of its algorithms, capable of detecting even distributed stealthy reconnaissance attacks. It consists of two main functional modules or stages: the reconnaissance activity profiler (RAP), followed by the reconnaissance alert correlation (RAC), along with a security console. RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now. Thus, the RIDS system promises to provide an early warning by detecting the reconnaissance first phase of an impending attack, even if it is very stealthy and distributed.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437816","","Data security;Ethernet networks;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Prototypes;Reconnaissance;Senior members;Student members;System testing","security of data;system monitoring","alert correlation;anomaly detection;distributed stealthy reconnaissance attack;reconnaissance intrusion detection system;session oriented statistical tool","","0","","13","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","4","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Next, a secure compiler constructs object code which generates the predetermined execution behavior at runtime. During program execution, a secure profiler monitors the execution behavior. If the profiler cannot detect the expected behavior, it sends an alarm signal to the microprocessor for terminating program execution. Since attack code cannot anticipate the execution behavior required, malicious attacks can be detected and prohibited at the start of program execution.","","1-4244-0395-2","1-4244-0395-2","10.1109/ICECS.2006.379744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4263328","","Authentication;Buffer overflow;Computer displays;Computer security;Data security;Informatics;Information security;Intrusion detection;Microprocessors;Runtime","invasive software","attack code;authentication;computer security issues;dynamic program execution;dynamic program signature;execution behavior;hardware-based intrusion detection;intrusion detection framework;microprocessors;secret key information;secure compiler","","0","","11","","","10-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tenth International Conference on","20080415","2008","","","216","223","A Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems (DIPPS) not only detects and prevents possible intrusions but also possesses the capability to predict possible intrusions in a distributed network. Based on the DIPS sensors, instead of merely preventing the attackers or blocking traffic, we propose a fuzzy logic based online risk assessment scheme. The key idea of DIPPS is to protect the network(s) linked to assets, which are considered to be very risky. To implement DIPPS we used a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) with extended real time traffic surveillance and online risk assessment. To model and predict the next step of an attacker, we used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the interaction between the attacker and the network. The interaction between various DIDS and integration of their output are achieved through a HMM. The novelty of this paper is the detailed development of Fuzzy Logic Controllers to estimate the various risk(s) that are dependent on several other variables based on the inputs from HMM modules and the DIDS agents. To develop the fuzzy risk expert system, if-then fuzzy rules were formulated based on interviews with security experts and network administrators. Preliminary results indicate that such a system is very practical for protecting assets which are prone to attacks or misuse, i.e. highly at risk.","","0-7695-3114-8","","10.1109/UKSIM.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488934","distributed monitoring;fuzzy logic;internet security;intrusion prevention","Electronics packaging;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Hybrid intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Real time systems;Risk management;Telecommunication traffic","","","","5","","6","","","1-3 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, attack attribution and situational understanding are considered critical aspects to effectively deal with emerging, increasingly sophisticated Internet attacks. This requires highly scalable analysis tools to help analysts classify, correlate and prioritise security events, depending on their likely impact and threat level. However, this security data mining process typically involves a considerable amount of features interacting in a non-obvious way, which makes it inherently complex. To deal with this challenge, we introduce MR-TRIAGE, a set of distributed algorithms built on MapReduce that can perform scalable multi-criteria data clustering on large security data sets and identify complex relationships hidden in massive datasets. The MR-TRIAGE workflow is made of a scalable data summarisation, followed by scalable graph clustering algorithms in which we integrate multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Theoretical computational complexity of the proposed parallel algorithms are discussed and analysed. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms can scale well and efficiently process large security datasets on commodity hardware.

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the contemporary signaling protocol used in VoIP Networks. The protocol itself is vulnerable to most of the threats that happen in VoIP Networks. Regardless to register highly scalable incidents, it is widely considered by experts as the futuristic target for attackers.

IEEE Workshop on","20051114","2005","","","39","46","Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for: 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies; 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns; 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the histographs (Pin Ren and Watson, 2005) technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks.","","0-7803-9477-1","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532064","","Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Computer security;Computer worms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Invasive software;Management information systems;Protection;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security","IDGraphs;correlated attack discovery;distributed attacks;flow-level trace;histographs;interactive visualization system;port scanning;statistical intrusion detection system;stealthy TCP SYN flooding;traffic anomaly;worm outbreaks;worm propagation pattern analysis","","7","1","31","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtual machines are becoming increasing popular for deploying servers because they allow checkpointing and live migration facilities. The challenges are dealing with non-virtual state elements, like ongoing network communications that can't be check-pointed, and recovering state changed between failure and the last check-point. Other complications include dependence on human intervention and precise timing so as not to revert to an un-healthy VM already in the state of compromise. This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's ""many worlds theory"" that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services","","0-7695-2788-4","","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882","","Checkpointing;Humans;Internet;Mission critical systems;Network servers;Telecommunications;Timing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server","Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines","Internet;VoIP;Xen based middleware;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;human intervention;many worlds theory;mission-critical telecom servers;nonvirtual state elements;reincarnation security","","0","1","10","","","19-23 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In other words, first different sets of features are created by mapping the original features into new spaces where the samples are well separated, and then each base classifier is trained on one of these newly created features sets. The proposed method for constructing an ensemble of classifiers is a general method which may be used in any classification problem. KDD-99 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method and the results are compared with some recent works in the literature using the same dataset.

CSF '07. 20th IEEE","20070716","2007","","","311","325","Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.","1940-1434","0-7695-2819-8","","10.1109/CSF.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657","","Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","safety systems;security of data;software reliability","automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions","","9","2","50","","","6-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Netflow statistics is mainly used to allocate the weights for traffic routing by routers. A new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput by the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in real network circumstances. The algorithm shows its advantages that it just occupies a small part of resources. Moreover, it can optimize the network traffic simultaneously with defending against DDoS attack, thus eliminating efficiently the global burst of traffic arising from normal traffic so as to improve greatly the efficiency of servers.","","978-0-7695-3556-2","","10.1109/MMIT.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089117","DDoS attack;Genetic algorithm;Netflow;Worm","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Databases;Filtering algorithms;Filters;High-speed networks;Routing;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","filtering theory;genetic algorithms;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","Bloom filter table;DDoS filtering algorithm;IP address database;Netflow statistics;bloom filter white list;depleted bandwidth;distributed-denial-of-service traffic;genetic algorithm;high speed network;routers;traffic flows;traffic routing","","0","","12","","","30-31 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trusted domain enforcement of guest OS is improved by interruption and strong isolation provided by VMM. VMM based TDE is achieved by two steps. A non-write protected input for guest domain is detected, notification is sent to VMM. Then, VMM isolates the domain from other domains. Proposed system needs notification channel passing VMM and guest OS modification. We discuss the way to create the notification channel by a newly added VMM interruption.

This adaptive approach can overcome the limitations of traditional trust schemes, whereby the trusted operators are weighted manually or subjectively.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The methodology is supported by a tool that automatically generates the circuitry for the given regular expressions, outputting VHDL representations ready for logic synthesis. Furthermore, techniques to reduce the area cost of our designs and maximize performance when targeting FPGAs were included. Experimental results show that our tool is able to generate a regular expression engine to match more than 500 IDS regular expressions (from the Snort ruleset) using only 25K logic cells and achieving 2 Gbps throughput on a Virtex2 and 2.9 on a Virtex4 device.

Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated. It can also handle repetition of both single and multi-symbol sub-expressions.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6673707","","","computer network security;digital signatures;finite automata;symbol manipulation","Glushkov nondeterministic flnite automata;NFA;NIDS;NIDS rule sets;attack signatures;bit-parallel architecture;constrained repetitions;deep packet inspection;hardware acceleration;multisymbol subexpressions;network intrusion detection systems;regular expression repetitions;standard BP system","","0","","","","","December 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection","","2","","28","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","0","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It has become a great challenge to develop scalable solutions for next-generation packet classification that support higher throughput, larger rule sets and more packet header fields. For low-cost high performance embedded networking applications, the best solution could be doing packet classification by special designed hardware, which can effectively release the burden of system CPU. In order to improve the speed of packet classification, exhibit good memory performance and support quick rule update, a high-speed packet classification system based on FPGA is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of parallel processing, pipeline and hardware circuit, the throughput has been improved greatly; defining the size of the tree nodes to be binary tree, the memory usage can be more efficient. The binary tree structure is generated through pre-processing on computer, which does not influence the searching speed of FPGA. During the packet header division, the division field is dynamic and selected according to the rules.

However, lightweight models using Trust Monitoring System (TMS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are limited. This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network. In this way, the proposed model identifies and isolates the malicious nodes from the data aggregation process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this model.","","978-1-4799-6760-5","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.7150633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150633","Data aggregation;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;malicious activity;security;trust monitoring system","Computational modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Nickel;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","head selection;intrusion detection systems;secure data aggregation;trust monitoring system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","16-18 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation.

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

The heart of this paradigm will be the “information management and services” plane as a unifying umbrella, which will operate above heterogeneous network devices and data sources, and will provide advanced secure information services enabling powerful higher-layer applications.","","978-1-4799-8324-7","","10.1109/RIOT.2015.7104906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7104906","IoT;Security;Smart Cities","Authorization;Cities and towns;Cryptography;Heating;Monitoring","Internet of Things;data privacy;database management systems;decision making;distributed processing;information services;smart cities;town and country planning;trusted computing","IoT-based applications;SMARTIE project;data owner privacy requirements;data sources;data-centric paradigm;decision-making purposes;distributed framework;end-to-end security;heterogeneous information processing;heterogeneous information sharing;heterogeneous information storing;heterogeneous network devices;information delivery;information management;secure IoT data management;secure and smarter cities data management;secure information services;smart city applications;trust","","0","","7","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152μ seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the incident investigation, Intelligence gathering is the first phase of such attacks. To evade detection, hacker may make use of botnet, a set of zombie machines, to gain the access of a target and the zombies send the collected results back to the hacker. Even though the zombies would be blocked by detection system, the hacker, using the access information obtained from the botnet, would login the target from another machine without being noticed by the detection system. Such information gathering tactic can evade detection and the hacker grants the initial access to the target. The proposed defense system analyzes multiple logs from the network and extracts the reconnaissance attack sequences related to targeted attacks. State-based model is adopted to model the steps of the above early phase attack performed by multiple scouts and an intruder and such attack events in a long time frame becomes significant in the state-aware model.

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763","978-1-4244-4498-4","978-1-4244-4499-1","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the soft decision based on the neural network, the robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved.

In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%.
