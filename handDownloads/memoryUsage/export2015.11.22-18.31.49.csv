Most of these networked control systems that are not designed with security protection can be vulnerable to network attacks nowadays, so there is a growing demand of efficient and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the network infrastructure of industrial plants. In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called ant colony clustering model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution. The experimental results on KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark data demonstrate that applying ACCM with one of the feature extraction algorithms is effective to detect known or unseen intrusion attacks with high detection rate and recognize normal network traffic with low false positive rate","","0-7803-9484-4","","10.1109/ICIT.2005.1600609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1600609","Clustering;Feature extraction;Industrial network security;Intrusion detection;Swarm intelligence","Biological system modeling;Clustering algorithms;Computer network management;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Feature extraction;Industrial control;Intrusion detection;Networked control systems;Protection","decentralised control;feature extraction;industrial control;industrial plants;multi-agent systems;optimisation;pattern clustering;safety systems","KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark;ant colony clustering approach;decentralized intrusion detection;decentralized management;industrial control systems;industrial network;industrial plants;large switched networks;multiagent intrusion detection system;network attacks;networked control systems;normal network traffic;optimization principles;prevention control;security protection;swarm intelligence;unsupervised feature extraction;unsupervised feature extraction algorithms","","14","","5","","","14-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDS is a software that monitors the computer network and detects the suspicious activities that occur in the systems or network. The process of intrusion detection includes detecting intrusion. Intrusion is a suspicious activity attempted by the attacker. This paper presents a fuzzy-genetic approach to detecting network intrusion. Paper presents the results of the proposed system in terms of accuracy, execution time, and memory allocation. To implement and measure the performance of the system the KDD99 benchmark dataset is used. The KDD99 dataset is a benchmark dataset that researchers use in various network security researches.

This special purpose controller is a parallel and pipelined processor architecture which can deal with the regular expression semantics. Two hardware stacks are implemented in SMPC to support fast branches when the non-matching occurs. Our implementation processes 4 characters per clock cycle (maximum performance of state of the art solutions) and occupies only O(n) memory (where n is the length of the regular expression). Via synthesizing the verilog description and analyzing area/time constraints, SMPC can achieve 200~400 times speedup over traditional CPU implementations and up to 7.9Gbps in processing throughput.

IEEE International Conference on","20060619","2006","1","","8 pp.","","Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for collecting critical data in various applications. Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (""invariants""). These invariants are associated with conditions (the ""observed variables"") of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network. We construct a prototype to demonstrate the benefit of run-time detection and correction","","0-7695-2553-9","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636206","","Aggregates;Application software;Bandwidth;Error correction;Face detection;Fault detection;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Runtime;Wireless sensor networks","computer debugging;error correction;error detection;fault diagnosis;protocols;system recovery;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","H-SEND;fault diagnosis;hierarchical sensor network debugging;observation channel;protocol;semiautomatic approach;software error detection;wireless network","","3","","31","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Far from developing primary immune response, as most of the related works do, it attempts to evolve this primary immune response to a secondary immune response using the concept of memory cells prevalent in natural immune systems. A genetic algorithm using genetic operators- selection, cloning, crossover and mutation- facilitates this. Memory cells formed enable faster detection of already encountered attacks. These memory cells, being highly random in nature, are dependent on the evolution of the detectors and guarantee greater immunity from anomalies and attacks. The fact that the whole procedure is enveloped in the concepts of approximate binding and memory cells of lightweight of natural immune systems makes this system reliable, robust and quick responding.","","978-0-7695-3184-7","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557836","artificial immune system;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system","Artificial immune systems;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Detectors;Gene expression;Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Phase detection","genetic algorithms;security of data","anomaly detection;artificial immune system;computer networks;evolution induced secondary immunity;genetic algorithm;genetic operators;intrusion detection system;memory cells;natural immune systems;primary immune response;secondary immune response","","5","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The advent of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and autonomous aircraft represents a unique opportunity to allow for rapid response, while minimizing the cost of deployment and increasing reliability and operator safety. This paper describes the key challenges to implement fault-tolerant and efficient deployments of collaborative autonomous aircraft to increase operational reliability and performance when performing aerial sensing and assessment. Some challenges are introduced by mobility, such as wireless communication, group navigation, and data collection. Security also represents a challenge during the operation of the MANET. We consider the effects of limited resources (e.g., real-time processing power, battery packs) available on the aircraft. By understanding both the application context and the resource availability, networked aircraft can reorganize to ensure resiliency for the mission if a resource failure occurs within the network.","","978-1-4673-5287-1","978-1-4673-5286-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504199","Energy efficiency;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad-hoc networks;Robust and secure wireless communication;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","Aircraft;Aircraft navigation;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Routing;Security","aircraft communication;cost reduction;disasters;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MANET aerial communication;aerial assessment performance;aerial sensing performance;autonomous aircraft deployment;cost minimization;data collection;fault-tolerant;group navigation;mobile ad-hoc network;natural disaster;operational reliability;operator safety;radio receiver;real-time processing power;resource availability;resource failure network;search-rescue application;security;transportation infrastructure;wireless communication","","2","","23","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experiments demonstrate that our system can achieve an especially low false positive rate (approximating 0.3%) and false negative rate (approaching 0.4%) while keeping an extremely low computational complexity","","1-4244-0061-9","","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028526","Intrusion detection systems (IDS);false alarm rate (FAR);false negative rate (FNR);machine learning","Computational complexity;Computer networks;Cybernetics;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Real time systems;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;security of data","FAR;FNR;Web severs;Web-based attack detection;Web-based intrusion detection system;computational complexity;computer networks;dynamic load-balancing algorithm;false alarm rate;false negative rate;machine learning algorithm","","1","","17","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel memory architecture using perfect hashing to condense state transition tables without hash collisions.

Therefore security in Wireless Sensor Network WSNs is challenging and critical to the functionality of the networked sensors. This is very important in cases of highly secure environment, especially in industrial, military, and medical domains. The standard WSN protocols focus on energy efficiency; transmission efficiency, and routing. WSN is known for limitations on hardware and software and for resources-constrained in general. An adaptive model of security that meets requirements and constraints in WSN is Intrusion Detections.

In this framework, multimodal biometrics are used for continuous authentication, and intrusion detection is modeled as sensors to detect system security state. We formulate the whole system as a partially observed Markov decision process considering both system security requirements and resource constraints. We then use dynamic programming-based hidden Markov model scheduling algorithms to derive the optimal schemes for both intrusion detection and continuous authentication.

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well. The comparison of these algorithms has been performed using WEKA tool and listed below according to certain performance metrics. Simulation of these classification models has been performed using 10-fold cross validation.

Existing network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has drawbacks in many aspects, among of which the two outstanding problems are the high ratio of false alarms and the lack of self-adaptation. The powerful information processing capabilities of the biological immune system, such as feature extraction, pattern recognition, learning, memory, and its distributive multi-layer defence mechanisms provide rich metaphors for designing a computer immune defence system. In this approach, the authors propose a novel multi-layer defence mechanisms based on immunity, which is capable of detecting and identifying both known and unknown intrusions, elaborating a specialized response measure. Besides that, the proposed defence mechanisms have the same learning and adaptive capability of the biological immune system, and so it is able to monitor networked computer's activities at different levels, and to improve its response under subsequent exposures to the same attack. This on-going research effort is not to mimic simply the immunology characteristics but to explore and learn valuable lessons useful for self-adaptive immune intrusion prevention systems.","","978-0-7695-3334-6","","10.1109/WGEC.2008.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4637445","Biological immune system;Computer immune system;Immunology;Intrusion detection system;Multi-layer defence mechanism;Network security","Biology computing;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Pathogens;Pattern recognition;Protection","adaptive systems;computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;monitoring;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","adaptive learning system;biological immune system;computer immune defence mechanism;computer network activity monitoring;multilayer network intrusion detection system;self-adaptive immune intrusion prevention system","","0","","13","","","25-26 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides eliminating the need for finer exhaustive search in the attack database records in which the detected subsequence is too distorted, the new search procedure also enables better control over the search process in the case of deliberate distortion of the attack strings.

Static nodes with pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor and digital camera are mounted on doorframes and windows to detect intruders and send intrusion alarm messages to the home server. Transmote with PIR sensor and camera can patrol in the house for security surveillance. Transmote also can provide network repairing service when some static router nodes fail. Transmote modules and static monitoring nodes are controlled by two different wireless sensor networks. The remote house owner can get the alarm messages through Internet. Transmote can transform into I-shaped or O-shaped configuration according to different locomotion requirements. A prototype system has been implemented and some performance tests have been done. Experimental results show that the I-shaped Transmote can pass through an 8.8 cm high and 10 cm wide channel.

Dynamic forensics using IDS or honeypot are all based on a common hypothesis that the system is still in a reliable working situation and collected evidences are believable even if the system is suffered from intrusion. In fact, the system has already transferred into an insecurity and unreliable state, it is uncertain that whether the intrusion detectors and investigators could run as normal and whether the obtained evidences are credible. Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics. The work presented in this paper is based on an idea to integrate intrusion tolerance into dynamic forensics to make the system under control, ensure the reliability of evidences and aim to gather more useful evidences for investigation. A mechanism of dynamic forensics based on intrusion forensics is proposed.

When compared to wired and base station-based wireless networks: MANETs are susceptible to both insider and outsider attacks. This is mainly because of the lack of well-defined defense perimeter. In this paper, we define distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANET networks. Our design is using the concept of network capabilities and is especially suited for environment which lacks centralized structure and is composed of different devices. Our model denies all communication by default and nodes can access only services and other nodes that they are authorized to. Every node contains a firewall mechanism which includes intrusion prevention system and compromised node will not necessarily compromise whole secured network. Our approach should add security features for MANETs and help them withstand security threats which would otherwise damage, if not shutdown unsecured MANET network. Our simulation shows, that our solution has minimal overhead in terms of bandwidth and latency, works well even in the presence of routing changes due to mobile nodes and is effective in containing misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/SAMI.2015.7061882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061882","Ad hoc;firewall;mobile network;network capability","Databases;Firewalls (computing);Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key","computer network reliability;firewalls;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","base station-based wireless network routing;civil rapid-deployment network security;distributed firewall architecture;emergency rescue operations;intrusion prevention system security threats;mobile ad hoc disaster-relief network;mobile node fault;tactical military MANET;well-defined defense perimeter","","0","","9","","","22-24 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many proposed schemes were presented recently, but none of which, employing separate system bus, have been proven experimentally as a potentially effective method for protecting the data stored in hard drives and removable disks. In our scheme, the system does not need to maintain any authentication mechanism or data integrity for the packets sent by any node, with a well-received attention towards threatening our valuable stored data. In this paper we implemented a model for a dual bus architecture system based on a bus bridge which controls the data transferred between the two system buses, as well as preventing all spy ware programs. The experiment is done and the result has proven that the dual bus architecture is reasonable and effective. The analysis also showed that the entire computer system, including peripherals is well protected from outside intruders.","","978-1-4673-2670-4","","10.1109/SERE-C.2012.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258458","Computer Architecture;Dual-Bus System;HDL Modeling and Simulation;Intrusion Prevention System","Computer architecture;Computers;Program processors;Security;Switches","security of data;system buses","Von Neumann architecture;bus bridge;data processing;data protection;network communication;secure PC platform;single CPU dual bus architecture;spy ware programs","","0","","16","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A pattern consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps of fixed lengths. PERG preprocesses a database of these patterns into hardware. To our knowledge, PERG is the first pattern matching hardware targeting viruses, as well as the first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into one modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. The architecture achieves roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern-matching engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used.

In order to ensure high security this work focuses on multiple classifier fusion technique to increase detection rate. The primary role of classifier is to classify the correct and incorrect instance therefore multiple classifier design that is practical, and detects more attack by means of combining them is preferred here. To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done. Decision based on threshold value and combining the classifiers result based on majority voting rule helps to increase the overall efficiency and accuracy in detecting the various categories of attack.","","978-1-4799-3826-1","","10.1109/ICCPEIC.2014.6915405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915405","Fusion;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Majority Voting Rule;Multiple Classifier","","security of data;sensor fusion","detection methodologies;diversified intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;misuse based attacks;multiple classifier fusion technique;security;sensor fusion;threshold value","","0","","17","","","16-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network traffic monitoring is can be quite a network diagnostic tool that monitors local area networks and provides a graphical display of network statistics. While collecting information through the network's data stream, network monitor displays the source address of the computer that sent a frame onto the network, the destination address of the computer that received the frame and also the protocols employed to send the frame. The procedure through which network monitor collects this information is known as Capturing. Automatically, the network monitor gathers statistics on all of the frames it detects on the network into a capture buffer that is a reserved storage area in memory. To capture statistics on merely a specific subset of frames, we could discriminate these frames by designing a capture filter. To work with network monitor, the computer will need to have a network card that supports promiscuous mode.

Furthermore, LS-SVM adopts equality constraints and squared functions, which leads to solve an easy-to-compute linear system, however followed is the lack of sparseness, all training data will become the support vector of LS-SVM, which cause the low intrusion detection speed. This paper proposed a novel LS-SVM intrusion detection model using kernel space approximation through greedy searching, thus constructed a subspace basis of original space populated by training data. Through this approximation, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate LS-SVM model were reduced, which greatly helped to improve the response time of intrusion detection. The kernel-target alignment method was utilized to obtain optimal Gaussian kernel parameter and 10-fold cross-validate method to obtain optimal trade-off parameter.

To run our algorithm, the network is divided into clusters and three types of nodes called header, monitor and general node are defined in each cluster. Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new architecture that uses the basic principles of cloud computing, virtualization, and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane and applies them to intrusion detection systems, in order to protect cloud networks characterized by a constantly changing underlying infrastructure and physical topology. Our research is not focused on new algorithms or products capable of solving the security problem in cloud networks: our goal is to define a process and a novel architecture that minimizes the security risk in distributed networks, implementing the principle that network security and reliability is not a “product,” but a well defined “process.” On the basis of the defined architecture we have implemented a prototype cloud-based IDS that validates our thesis. The prototype is realized though the integration of two open source technologies: OpenNebula and Dynamic Resource Allocation via GMPLS Optical Networks (DRAGON). © 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.21562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6770191","","","","","","0","","","","","Dec. 2012","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network. The experiments show good detection quality and illustrate the usefulness of adapting to normality.","","0-7695-2328-5","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2005.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437175","","Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Data mining;Electronic mail;Face detection;Indexing;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Testing","IP networks;data mining;data structures;pattern clustering;real-time systems;telecommunication security","ADW ICE;IP network;KDD data set;anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering;data mining techniques;data structures;grid-based index;real-time anomaly detection","","1","","15","","","6-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this paper is to survey the various threats facing AMIs and the common attack techniques used to realize them in order to identify and understand the requirements for a comprehensive intrusion detection solution. The threat analysis leads to an extensive “attack tree” that captures the attackers' key objectives (e.g., energy theft) and the individual attack steps (e.g., eavesdropping on the network) that would be involved in achieving them. With reference to the attack tree, we show the type of information that would be required to effectively detect attacks.

String searching is at the core of the tools we use to curb this explosion, such as search engines, network intrusion detection systems, spam filters, and anti-virus programs. But as communication speed grows, our capability to perform string searching in real-time seems to fall behind. Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power. We have parallelized a popular string searching algorithm, Aho-Corasick, on the IBM Cell/B.E. processor, with the goal of performing exact string matching against large dictionaries. In this article we propose a novel approach to fully exploit the DMA-based communication mechanisms of the Cell/B.E. to provide an unprecedented level of aggregate performance with irregular access patterns. We have discovered that memory congestion plays a crucial role in determining the performance of this algorithm. We discuss three aspects of congestion: memory pressure, layout issues and hot spots, and we present a collection of algorithmic solutions to alleviate these problems and achieve quasi-optimal performance.

Most applications are written in a higher-level language with an associated support library such as C or C++.

To perform this checking different pattern matching methods are used by NIDS. The most popular method to implement pattern matching is to use of Finite Automata (FA). Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks. The DFA based pattern matching methods are fast enough but require more memory. However, NFA based pattern matching methods are comparatively takes less memory but the speed of matching is very slow, to overcome these drawbacks of finite automata there are many approaches have been proposed.

The problem that this paper addresses is that there is no harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model with appropriate implementation guidelines and, thus, there is a lack of an effective and standardised implementation of digital forensic investigation readiness measures within organisations.

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems with off-the-shelf ICT hardware and software found their way in Process Control Systems (PCSs) due to their simplicity and cost-efficiency. However, recent incidents such as Stuxnet, Duqu or Night Dragon revealed new ICT vulnerabilities and attack scenarios in PCSs. Nevertheless, as shown by recent events, security studies on real SCADA systems are challenging due to the lack of proper experimentation environments. Through this work we develop a method to generate realistic network traffic in laboratory conditions without the need of a real PCS installation. This is indeed our main contribution as the basis of future anomaly detection systems. Such method could support experimentation through the recreation of realistic traffic in simulated environments. The accuracy and fidelity of the proposed approach was validated with several statistical methods that compare the predicted traffic with traffic taken from a real in stallation.","1946-0740","978-1-4673-4735-8","978-1-4673-4736-5","10.1109/ETFA.2012.6489550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6489550","","","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;critical infrastructures;process control;security of data;statistical analysis","Duqu;ICT hardware;ICT software;ICT vulnerability;Information and Communication Technology;Night Dragon;PCS installation;SCADA system;Stuxnet;Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system;anomaly detection system;attack scenario;critical infrastructure;experimentation environment;network traffic model;process control system;security study;statistical method","","1","","17","","","17-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we report our progress in the development of an agent-based cooperative anomaly detection scheme for wireless ad hoc networks. The approach addresses the underlying distributed and cooperative nature of wireless ad hoc networks and adds one more dimension of cooperation to the intrusion detection process. That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors. Without the requirements of pre-labeled attack data, the approach eliminates the time-consuming labeling process and the impacts of imbalanced dataset. Besides, the concept of software agent technology has been applied in system implementation, which provides further support for distributed wireless ad hoc networks","1521-9097","0-7695-2612-8","","10.1109/ICPADS.2006.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655710","","Ad hoc networks;Automation;Communication system security;Contracts;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data;software agents;telecommunication security","agent-based cooperative anomaly detection;distributed wireless ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;software agent;wireless ad hoc network security","","6","1","16","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the data traffic generation is based on control traffic, the behavior of the two planes is expected to be similar during normal behavior. Therefore, detecting dissimilarity (via cross-correlation) between the traffic of the two planes can indicate an abnormal behavior.

Still, significant challenges exist in design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labour intensive and complex engineering endeavour.

The proposed scheme consists of two systems: Context-based Mobile Security (CMS) client and server. The proposed scheme can automatically not only protect the MCD from cyber attacks, but also prevent the MCD from being used as an attack tool, by help of CMS server. As an additional advantage, the proposed scheme can maximize performance of the MCD in terms of computing resource efficiency and user convenience because it automatically manages the security of the MCD.","","978-1-4244-7007-5","978-1-4244-7009-9","10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665099","","Companies;Context;Mobile communication;Protocols;Prototypes;Security;Servers","client-server systems;mobile communication;mobile handsets;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing","CMS client and server;CMS server;MCD;attack tool;context-based mobile security;context-based remote security control scheme;cyber attacks;mobile communication device;resource efficiency;security threats;smartphone;user convenience","","0","","15","","","26-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.","1930-529X","978-1-4673-0920-2","978-1-4673-0919-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527","","","pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter","","0","","15","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
