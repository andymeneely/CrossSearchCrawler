By developing a system that learns the packets that are required to be transmitted towards targets, using feedback from an external network source, we make a step towards having a system that can intelligently explore the capabilities of a given security system. In order to validate our system's capabilities we evolve a variety of port scan patterns while running the packets through an IDS, with the goal to minimizes the alarms raised during the scanning process.

DDoS attacks often overwhelm or exhaust the resources of victims and typically result in abnormal bursty traffic passing through victim systems. In this paper, we develop a mechanism for diagnosing traffic anomalies caused by DDoS attacks on the basis of analyzing the behaviour of network traffic. The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour. The experimental results show that the developed mechanism can alert the DDoS attack schemes within short respond time.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295984","Anomaly diagnosis;DDoS attack;Intrusion detection;Traffic measurement","Computer crime;Correlation;Data models;Servers;Standards;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack behaviours;DDoS attack simulation experiments;Hurst parameter;MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset;abnormal bursty traffic;constant intensity;distributed denial-of-service attacks;network traffic anomaly;network traffic behaviour analysis;pulse behaviour;ramp-up behaviour;real-time diagnosis;statistical self-similar phenomena;statistical traffic analysis","","3","","18","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In case a misbehavior is detected, the proposed engine decides upon and takes optimal response actions to thwart the ongoing attacks.

For overcome this problem we present in this paper we proposed a novel parallel processing inspection model which is called CMRDS (Centralized multiple robust distribution system). This implies balanced parallel detection by adding multiple dimensions on pattern matching workload division from various different types of nodes. CMRDS allows multiple pattern matching algorithm and creates simultaneously different pattern set and handle variable pattern length efficiently for packet inspection is completed in O(N log M) and N is the size of the packet M is the longest packet length inspect packet for optimizing flow in the different network.

Regular expressions are one method to implement such matching and are often built in FPGAs using non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs). To obtain high throughputs it is necessary to process many bytes in parallel. This paper extends the modular NFA construction method of Sidhu and Prasanna to handle the processing of many bytes in parallel. The paper also introduces the concept of partial character decoding in which character match units are shared but the number of signals needed to be routed around the FPGA is reduced over previous shared-decoder approaches. With these approaches, throughput over 5Gbps is achieved for the full default Snort rule-set (23401 literals) in a Xilinx Virtex-2 6000 FPGA. Throughputs over 40Gbps are achieved on smaller rule-sets.

The current main problem in software testing management research is how to effectively manage the whole software testing process. Through research on V Model and W Model in software testing management, these models have themselves inherent limitations and are largely impractical. Reflective architectures are used to allow a software system to define its behavior at runtime based on information that can be stored in metadata. This paper proposes RATMM - reflective architecture based software testing management model. The model integrates reflection theory and software architecture design method, constructed software testing management model by using meta-information theory and meta-model method. RATMM is logically divided into meta-level and base-level. Meta-level and base-level are interrelated. Meta object captures condition and behavior of base-level, meta-level makes the corresponding metacomputing. Meta-level reflects the changes in meta-information to base-level after computing. Based on the description of its own condition and behavior, RATMM can adjust the testing process, obtain information about structure and behavior of testing process, and build software testing management model by reflective architecture. The model allows the user to modify condition of a software testing process without programming.

Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi.

Nodes use a trust based transmission method based on previous records of successful packet transmission. Nodes which violate this relay of packets and cause denial of service attack in the form flooding of large packets may cause congestion which needs to be detected. Whenever congestion occurs then the senders should lower their transmission rate, but if certain senders do not do this, it can be found by the destination by comparing it with the previous sending rate. When both the rates are equal, the corresponding sender is considered as an attacker and has to be removed from the existing path. Such type of node is continuously sending the control and data packets in the network, hindering the connection establishment. An adaptive approach is proposed which involves taking an alternate path to the destination which is less congested in order to complete the message transfer.","2347-9337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012833","Congestion;flooding;wireless network","Conferences;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;trusted computing","adaptive approach;denial of service attack;distributed detection;infrastructureless wireless network;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;packet flooding;trust based transmission method","","0","","10","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a prevailing technology due to its wide range of applications in military and civilian domains. These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency. In this paper multipath routing scheme is used as defense mechanism against selective forwarding attack. When a node detects packet drop during the routing, it will resend the packet through alternate route. Due to the resending mechanism reliability of the routing scheme is improved.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726833","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","defense mechanism;multipath routing;packet drop detection;routing reliability;security attack;selective forwarding attack;selective packet dropping;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) encompass one field of classification that has proven to yield high accuracy and has recently seen increased widespread use, however, the required computational intensity places a challenge on computer architects to design a hardware structure capable of performing real-time classifications while maintaining low power consumption. This paper proposes the first ever fully pipelined, floating point based, multi-use reconfigurable hardware architecture designed to act in conjunction with embedded processing as an accelerator for multiclass SVM classification. Several tasks, involving an extensive sample set of over 100,000 classifications, are evaluated for speed and accuracy against the same suite running on both an Intel Core i7-2600 system with lib SVM and an Nvidia GT 750M graphics card GPU.

Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

The wide spreading nature of worm will cause the network packet to be transfer massively over the network and cause the substantial increase in frequency. The threshold that detects the worm activity pattern will adjust accordingly to the increase of network traffic to accommodate high speed large network traffic.

However, existing parallel schemes often fail to achieve linear speedup in IDS. The throughput even deteriorates severely for some network traffics. Hence, exploring and addressing the problems have become one of the most urgent issues in parallel IDS. In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system. Second, we propose a new fingerprint extraction strategy to deal with HRF. Experimental results show that the throughput deterioration is resolved completely and the throughput is enhanced by 45% by integrating our proposed method into the test bed and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120879","Intrusion Detection System;Snort;multi-core;pre-fliter;software pipeline","","","","","0","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IDS to accomplish its function must, in some way, to guarantee reliability and availability to its own application, so that it gets to give continuity to the services even in case of faults, mainly faults caused by malicious agents. This paper proposes an adaptive fault tolerance mechanism for network intrusion detection system based on intelligent agents. We propose the creation of a society of agents that monitors a system to collect information related to agents and hosts. Using the information which is collected, it is possible: to detect which agents are still active; which agents should be replicated and which strategy should be used.

Many recent new services are based on cloud environments, and a lot of people are using cloud networks. Since many diverse hosts and network configurations coexist in a cloud network, it is essential to protect each of them in the cloud network from threats. To do this, basically, we can employ existing network security devices, but applying them to a cloud network requires more considerations for its complexity, dynamism, and diversity. In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks. This framework automatically detours network packets to be inspected by pre-installed network security devices. In addition, all these operations can be implemented by writing a simple policy script, thus, a cloud network administrator is able to protect his cloud network easily. We have implemented the proposed framework, and evaluated it on different test network environments.","","978-1-4673-2445-8","978-1-4673-2446-5","10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459946","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Security;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer network security","CloudWatcher framework;OpenFlow;cloud computing;cloud environment;cloud network administrator;dynamic cloud network;network packet;network security device;network security monitoring;policy script;security monitoring-as-a-service","","10","","17","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a new algorithm for the correlation of alerts generated by Network Intrusion Detection Systems. It is specifically oriented to face multistep attacks where multiple intrusion activities belonging to the same attack scenario are performed within a small time window. This algorithm takes as its input the security alerts generated by a NIDS and, through a pseudo-bayesian alert correlation, is able to identify those that are likely to belong to the same multistep attack scenario.

"An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers","Danhua Guo; Bhuyan, L.N.; Bin Liu","Microsoft Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on","20121011","2012","20","5","1426","1439","L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","1","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Digital Forensics (DF) is a vehicle that organizations use to provide good and trustworthy evidence and processes. The current DF models concentrate on reactive investigations, with limited reference to DF readiness and live investigations. However, organizations use DF for other purposes for example compliance testing. The paper proposes that DF consists of three components: Pro-active (ProDF), Active (ActDF) and Re-active (ReDF). ProDF concentrates on DF readiness and the proactive responsible use of DF to demonstrate good governance and enhance governance structures. ActDF considers the gathering of live evidence during an ongoing attack with a limited live investigation element whilst ReDF deals with the traditional DF investigation.

To address this issue, we propose Advance Oblivious comparison and VGuard, a framework that allows a Client and Server to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy. An efficient protocol, called Xhash, for Advance Oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of Guard is to first convert a firewall policy to non-overlapping numerical rules and then uses Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule.

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS. These simulations will quantify network throughput and device battery usage in large scale network deployments that are, and are not, using B-SIPS.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755621","","Batteries;Bluetooth;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Research initiatives;Sensor systems;Testing;Throughput","Bluetooth;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System research;Bluetooth;Wi-Fi;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;device battery usage;mobile devices;multi-vector attacks;network deployment validation;network simulations;network throughput;saturated network environment;throughput degradation;transmission rate","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters. The proposed solution has the ability of detecting different types of intrusions in realtime such as DOS, DDOS, scanning, distribution of worms and any other network attacks which produce huge amount of network traffic and in the meanwhile it detects Bot-Master if the detected attack lunched by Bots.","","978-1-4673-5137-9","","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747642","","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","Bot-Master detection;DDOS;NIDS solutions;RTU-NIDS;attack-free dataset;byte monitoring;engine training;misuse detection mechanism;network behavior matching;network flow monitoring;network traffic;packet payload monitoring;predefined attack signatures;real time multistage unsupervised intelligent engine;real time unsupervised network intrusion detection system;scanning;semisupervised anomaly detection systems;unknown attack detection rate enhancement;worm distribution;zero day attacks","","0","","27","","","23-25 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents Bezoar, an automated full-system virtual machine-based approach to recover from zero-day control-flow hijacking attacks. Bezoar tracks down the source of network bytes in the system and after an attack, replays the checkpointed run while ignoring inputs from the malicious source. We evaluated our proof-of-concept prototype on six notorious exploits for Linux and Windows. In all cases, it recovered the full system state and resumed execution.

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321","cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks","Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network","","10","","24","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in comparison to wired network or infrastructure-based wireless network, MANET is particularly vulnerable to security attacks due to its fundamental characteristics, e.g., the open medium, dynamic network topology, autonomous terminal, lack of centralized monitoring and management. The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network. The simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed method as throughput of the network does not deteriorate in presence of the back holes.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296067","AODV;Ad-hoc network;Black Hole Attack;Malicious node;Secured Routing","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;autonomous terminal;black hole problem prevention;centralized management;centralized monitoring;dynamic network topology;infrastructure-based wireless network;malicious node detection;mobile ad-hoc network;mobile devices;open medium;promiscuous mode;security attacks;wired network","","6","","21","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the identification and classification of network flows is done using machine learning, the characterization of traffic still requires an approach that is capable of providing a balance between accuracy and processing speed in real-time scenarios. This paper proposes an architecture to classify network traffic based on Stream Data Mining techniques using Graphic Processing Units (GPU), in order to meet the requirements of both classification accuracy and speed. Our proposal combines the characteristics of data mining techniques with a continuous stream of input data, and with high processing performance GPU architecture. Results show that our approach provides accuracy comparable to or better than existing related work (e.g., above 95%) while ramping up performance (e.g., up to 62x speed up), comparing the different implementations of our approach. These facts allow the deployment of the proposed technique to the real-time management of high speed backbone links.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912457","Computer Networks;Flow-based Classification;GPU;Stream Data Mining;Traffic Classification","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Entropy;Graphics processing units;Ports (Computers);Registers","computer network management;data mining;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","GPU architecture;GPU-oriented stream data mining traffic classification;classification accuracy;graphic processing units;machine learning;network flow classification;network flow identification;network management;network traffic classification;networked applications;speed backbone links;traffic profile","","1","","25","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

End-to-end Ethernet network management is currently under standardization, with a focus on connectivity fault management and performance management. However, none of the tools and research prototypes available to date integrate service-level monitoring with fault management functions such as event correlation or root cause analysis for interconnected Ethernet networks.

This algorithm clusters large data sets with mixed numeric and categorical values effectively. The intrusion detection system based on this algorithm can deal with massive unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and anomaly and even can detect unknown attacks.

Around four hundred mobile viruses, worms, trojans and spy ware, together with approximately one thousand of their variants have been discovered to-date. So far no classification of such mobile P2P security threats exists. There is no well known simulation environment to model mobile P2P network characteristics and provide a platform for the analysis of the propagation of different types of mobile malware. Therefore, our research provides a classification of mobile malware based on the behaviour of a node during infection and develops a platform to analyse malware propagation. It proposes and evaluates a novel behaviour-based approach, using AI, for the detection of various malware families. Unlike existing approaches, our approach focuses on identifying and classifying malware families rather than detecting individual malware and their variants. Adaptive detection of currently known and previously unknown mobile malware on designated mobile nodes through a deployed detection framework aided by AI classifiers enables successful detection. Although we have classified around 30% of the existing mobile P2P malware into 13 distinct malware families based on their behaviour during infection, this paper focuses on two, Cabir & Commwarrior, in order to analyse the proposed detection framework.","","978-1-4577-1931-8","","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113305","MPeersim;Malware Classification;Malware Detection;Malware Families;Malware Propagation;Mobile Agents;Mobile P2P Networks","Analytical models;Batteries;Bluetooth;Grippers;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","computer network security;computer viruses;invasive software;mobile agents;mobile computing;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","AI classifier;Cabir families;Commwarrior families;behaviour-based approach;malware family classification;mobile P2P malware detection framework;mobile malware classification;mobile network security;mobile node;mobile spyware;mobile trojan;mobile virus;mobile worm","","0","","18","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a kind of hardware based compact DFA structure for multiple regexes matching called CPDFA is presented. According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not. Simulation shows that CPDFA structure can save about 90% of memory storage comparing with the original DFA structure. By using pipelined architecture in FPGA, CPDFA can advance one character in one memory access cycle.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198833","","Application software;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Pattern matching;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security","DFA Structure;deterministic finite automata;indirect index;multiple regular expressions matching;parallel SRAMs;real-time deep packet inspection;regular expression matcher","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, it is easy to deploy and terminate large number of malicious virtual machines (VMs) in a few seconds while the administrator is probably difficult to identify these malicious VMs immediately. These features open doors for attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that target at degrading the quality of cloud service. This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors. We conduct our experiments in the campus-wide data center, and the results show our detection system can promptly and accurately response to DoS attacks.","","978-1-4799-8086-4","","10.1109/CBD.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176094","Attack Detection;Cloud Data Center;DoS Attack;Information Entropy","","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;data flow analysis;entropy;system monitoring;virtual machines","CPU usage;DoS attack;attack behavior;attack identification;campus-wide data center;cloud data center;cloud resources;cloud service quality degradation;data center subnets;data flow based detection;data flow pattern;entropy-based denial of service attack detection;information entropy;malicious VM;malicious tenants;malicious virtual machines;network resource isolation;network usage;virtual machine status monitoring","","0","","21","","","20-22 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is considered as the trusted computing base, and its integrity is extremely important for smooth functioning of the system. On the contrary, BIOS of new computer systems (servers, laptops, desktops, network devices, and other embedded systems) can be easily upgraded using a flash or capsule mechanism which can add new vulnerabilities either through malicious code, or by accidental incidents, and deliberate attack. The recent attack on Iranian Nuclear Power Plant (Stuxnet) [1:2] is an example of advanced persistent attack. This attack vector adds a new dimension into the information security (IS) spectrum, which needs to be guarded by implementing a holistic approach employed at enterprise level. Malicious BIOS upgrades can also cause denial of service, stealing of information or addition of new backdoors which can be exploited by attackers for causing business loss, passive eaves dropping or total destruction of system without knowledge of user. To address this challenge a capability for verification of BIOS integrity needs to be developed and due diligence must be observed for proactive resolution of the issue.

To tackle this issue, we propose a distributed, signature-based anomaly detector that evaluates the trustworthiness of others so as to secure such a distributed detection. Contrary to existing detectors that passively observe packets, our detector analyses logs so as to identify patterns of misuse and proactively collaborate with others to gather additional evidences. As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on second-hands evidences that may come from colluding attacker (s). To tackle this issue, we propose an entropy-based trust system that evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes that provide the evidences. We further introduce a novel indicator which measures the level of confidence in the detection.

Fourth International Conference on","20080919","2008","","","205","208","Misuse detection-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) perform search through a database of attack signatures in order to detect whether any of them are present in incoming traffic. For such testing, fault-tolerant distance measures are needed. One of the appropriate distance measures of this kind is constrained edit distance, but the time complexity of its computation is too high. We propose a two-phase indexless search procedure for application in misuse detection-based IDS that makes use of q-gram distance instead of the constrained edit distance. We study how well q-gram distance approximates edit distance with special constraints needed in IDS applications. We compare the performances of the search procedure with the two distances applied in it. Experimental results show that the procedure with the q-gram distance implemented achieves for higher values of q almost the same accuracy as the one with the constrained edit distance implemented, but the efficiency of the procedure that implements the q-gram distance is much better.","","978-0-7695-3324-7","","10.1109/IAS.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627086","Edit distance;Intrusion detection;Misuse detection;Search;q-gram distance","Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Indexing;Information security;Intrusion detection;Testing","database management systems;program testing;security of data;software fault tolerance","attack signatures attack signatures;fault-tolerant distance measures;intrusion detection systems;misuse detection;q-gram distance;time complexity;two-phase indexless search procedure","","0","","7","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Challenges for network monitoring include processing massive data, spotting unknown patterns, and interactive analysis for deeper reasoning. Generally, computers in intranets are categorized into crucial nodes or not depending on their roles. We address the issue of network events monitoring by focusing on crucial network nodes, and we present visualization approaches for crucial nodes monitoring and analysis. Contributions of this paper include an efficient categorization and exchange mechanism for multiple streaming data, a comprehensive interactive visualization system with coordinated views, and an intuitive radial visualization which fuses firewall data and IDS data inherently for crucial node monitoring.

A common data rate requirement for routers today is 10 Gigabits per second or higher. Also, the networking device requires the flexibility to perform packet forwarding and other complex functions such as firewall and quality of service. The router with a network processor can be a solution for these requirements. IPsec provides a standard, robust and extensible mechanism in which to provide security to IP and upper-layer protocols. We can protect packets between hosts, between network security gateways (e.g., routers or firewalls), or between hosts and network security gateways using IPsec. This paper presents an implementation of a VPN router hardware platform using IXP2800 which is Intel's network processor and Nitrox-II which is Cavium Networks' security processor. We described the hardware architecture of the implemented hardware platform and the software implementation to boot and manage the system. Also, we implemented IPv4 packet forwarding application which runs on the IXP2800.

A WMN has a hybrid network infrastructure with a backbone and an access network and usually is operated in both ad hoc and infrastructure modes with self-configuration and self-organization capabilities. In this article, we review security challenges, attacks, and countermeasures in the physical, medium access control (MAC), and network layers of wireless mesh backbone and access networks. We then extend the concept of traffic flow from IP networks and define meshflow in wireless mesh networks. Based on this new concept, we propose a comprehensive framework to realize network monitoring, user and router profiling, application and service balancing, and security protection in wireless mesh backbone networks. Practical issues and design trade-offs for implementing the proposed framework in real systems also are discussed.","1536-1284","","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4396942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4396942","","Communication system security;Communication system traffic control;Media Access Protocol;Metropolitan area networks;Monitoring;Spine;Wireless LAN;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless personal area networks;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;access protocols;ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","IP networks;access networks;flow-based network monitoring framework;hybrid network infrastructure;infrastructure modes;medium access control;multimedia services;network layers;router profiling;security challenges;security protection;service balancing;traffic flow;user profiling;wireless ad hoc network;wireless local area networks;wireless mesh backbone network;wireless metropolitan area networks;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor network","","7","","10","","","October 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, it faces several difficulties when applied to the most ubiquitous mobile code platform Java, as a new mechanism should be established in the enforcement phase to monitor program behavior of a thread in the Java virtual machine (JVM) instead of a process on the operating system. To address this problem, we develop a new method of model enforcement based on the JVM tool interface (JVMTI), which introduces few changes to JVM. Since the method keeps compatible with the Java specification requests (JSR), it enjoys a high level of portability. This paper also evaluates efficiency of our method under the assumption that each transition on the model costs a predefined constant period of time.","1976-0035","978-1-4244-5131-9","","10.1109/ICUT.2009.5405715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5405715","","Application software;Condition monitoring;Information security;Java;National security;Operating systems;Sun;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Yarn","Java;distributed programming;operating systems (computers);security of data;virtual machines","JVM tool interface;JVMTI-based model enforcement;Java platform;Java specification requests;Java virtual machine;mobile code security;model-based security framework;model-carrying code;operating system;ubiquitous mobile code platform;untrusted applications","","0","","13","","","20-22 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies distributed combined authentication and intrusion detection with data fusion in such MANETs. Multimodal biometrics are deployed to work with intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to alleviate the shortcomings of unimodal biometric systems. Since each device in the network has measurement and estimation limitations, more than one device needs to be chosen, and observations can be fused to increase observation accuracy using Dempster-Shafer theory for data fusion. The system decides whether user authentication (or IDS input) is required and which biosensors (or IDSs) should be chosen, depending on the security posture. The decisions are made in a fully distributed manner by each authentication device and IDS. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2010.2103098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678662","Authentication;biometrics;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);security","","authorisation;biometrics (access control);distributed processing;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer theory;IDS;MANET;biosensor;data fusion;distributed combined authentication;high-security mobile ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;multimodal biometric technology;user-to-device authentication","","8","","27","","2010-12-30","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
