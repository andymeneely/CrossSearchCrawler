The communications between nodes are multihop, and provided in a decentralized way without preexisting infrastructure. These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, wireless sensor networks must be secured from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and from forging sensor data. The security and privacy problem related to wireless sensor networkpsilas application has become a serious issue in the real service environment. In this paper, we propose our management platform and security framework for wireless sensor networks. The proposed framework has advantages as regards secure association and intrusion detection.

A number of the major techniques for network security protection, such as virtual private networks (VPN), firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), are all dependent on the speed and ability of packet classification. The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion. By adding a new regional code, which is used to encode the ranges spanning two regions or more, the improved mechanism is able to express all the ranges by only one entry. Simulation and characteristics analysis of real rule-sets verify this encoding mechanism's feasibility and efficiency in actual applications.","","978-0-7695-3932-4","978-1-4244-5467-9","10.1109/FCST.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392861","TCAM;entry expansion;packet classification;range matching","Computer science;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;National security;Protection;Quality of service;Routing;Virtual private networks;Wide area networks","computer network security;content-addressable storage;encoding;pattern matching","TCAM;encoding mechanism;entries expansion;network security protection;packet classification;range matching;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","14","","","17-19 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Characterizing the service times of network IDSs is a crucial step in improving their real time performance. We analyzed about 41 million packets organized in five data sets of 10 minutes each collected at the entry point of a large production network and processed by Snort, a commonly used IDS. The processing times of the three main stages in Snort were measured. The main conclusions of our study were: (1) rule checking accounts for about 75% of the total processing time in IDSs, with mean pay load checking time being 4.5 times larger than mean header checking time. (2) The distribution of rule checking limes is markedly bimodal, a direct consequence of the bimodality in packet composition in current high speed Internet traffic. (3) Header processing times have a small variance and small correlation coefficients. (4) In contrast, the distribution of payload processing times displays high variance, in a form that can be generally characterized as ""slightly heavy-tailed"". Explicitly, payload processing times have a lognormal upper tail, clipped at the top 1%. This extreme 1% upper tail is better fit by an exponential distribution. (5) Additionally, payload processing times were shown to be highly correlated, with correlation coefficients several orders of magnitude higher than the confidence bands for the standard whiteness test. The impact of these findings in the design of IDSs for real time operation in networks is discussed, and compared with existing results for processing times for Unix processes, which were shown to display pronounced heavy-tailed characteristics.","0191-2216","0-7803-8682-5","","10.1109/CDC.2004.1428609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428609","","Data security;Displays;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Production;Statistical distributions","Internet;exponential distribution;information systems;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;Snort;Unix processes;exponential distribution;lognormal upper tail;network intrusion detection system;payload processing times;security violations;statistical distribution","","14","","24","","","14-17 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, the IDSs can perform other functions like intrusion prevention (IPS), including proactive functions. A recurrent problem in intrusion detection systems is the difficulty to distinguish legitimate access from attacks. A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time.

In this paper, to develop a security framework has been proposed. This security framework involves: detection of malicious nodes by the destination node, isolation of malicious nodes by discarding the path and prevention data packets by using dispersion techniques. We propose to develop a multipath reliable routing (MRR) algorithm, which determines a set of node-disjoint reliable paths. The paths are arranged in the descending order of their reliability index. Data packets are dispersed and transmitted simultaneously through the reliable disjoint paths. The primary reliable path sends the information packet containing the transmission information. At the destination, if there is mismatch between the transmission information and the data packets received, a negative feedback is sent back to the source that includes the particulars of the affected paths. The affected paths are then removed from the list of node-disjoint paths by the source. The destination can recover the data effectively by attaining reliability, since the data packets are dispersed along multiple paths using an efficient dispersion algorithm. Our simulation result shows that, when compared with existing scheme, our framework reduces overhead and delay, at the same time increasing the packet delivery ratio.","","978-1-4244-3594-4","978-1-4244-3595-1","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787688","Detection;Dispersion;Malicious;Multipath;Reliable","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Dispersion;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Routing;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;data forwarding operations;dispersion techniques;efficient dispersion algorithm;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath reliable routing algorithm;negative feedback;network layer security solution;node-disjoint reliable paths;packet delivery ratio;reliability index;security attacks","","3","","17","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For both types of systems, a white-listing mechanism, in which some strings or instructions are regarded as innocuous, is necessary to avoid a high false positive rate associated with common content such as URL addresses and peer-to-peer traffic. In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated attack model that not only makes malcode payloads look like nominal ones, but which is also assumed to be both aware of and exploitative of the white-listing itself in forming a Trojan mechanism. In other words, the malware attempts to embed its malcode into the prevalent content that is normally white-listed. If the malcode is encrypted, the attacker will also attempt to obfuscate its plain-text decryption code as much as possible. Both current string-based and instructionbased systems will likely fail to detect such attacks. We propose a comprehensive IDS model in the paper and discuss some potential defensive mechanisms against such attack.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567340","","Computer networks;Computer worms;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Embedded computing;Humans;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Payloads","cryptography;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","IDS model;Trojan mechanism;URL addresses;code obfuscation;covert malware modeling;encryption;generalized suffix tree;network defenses;payload-based detection;peer-to-peer traffic;string-based content prevalence;white-listing mechanism;zero-day attacks","","0","1","35","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some systems are used for providing security to this data. Like these systems intrusion detection system (IDS) is used for providing security to computer networks and information systems. In IDS many systems uses number of techniques for providing accuracy by selecting complete features of dataset but they lagged in terms of time and memory. For real time applications time and memory is critical issue. So, there is a need of such systems which will minimize time and memory parameters. This paper presents IDS using two Methods. These both methods based on neural network. First method uses less features of dataset using Principal component Analysis (PCA) technique and second method uses complete features of dataset. Experiments are performed on these two methods using KDD Cup 99 dataset. The results simulate the effect of less featured based incomplete learning technique and complete feature based learning technique. According to the obtained results when the system usage the less features of KDD Cup 99 dataset with incomplete instances of data then the classification accuracy of model becomes less efficient as compared to the entire dataset training but it is efficient for time and memory parameters. So, Method I is beneficial for real time applications.

The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism.

Proceedings. 20th IEEE Symposium on","20020806","2001","","","99","108","Local and wide area network information assurance analysts need current and precise knowledge about their system activities in order to address the challenges of critical infrastructure protection. In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance.

Its high computational demands have been pushing networking researchers to study how to improve DPI technologies. However, in this quest for better performance, little effort has been devoted to making fair performance comparisons among DPIs. Even worse, most studies show performance gains by applying DPI techniques using specific, and sometimes small, signature sets. Consequently, one DPI engine may report a certain maximum throughput while another one may report a similar performance but may have used a significantly smaller signature set. This fact makes it clear that the research community needs a well-defined framework for testing new DPI systems.

Low processing power and wireless connectivity make such networks vulnerable to various types of attacks. The dense deployment of sensors along with the protocol deficiencies, make broadcast attacks feasible. The current solutions for these types of attacks are mainly cryptographic and suffer from either heavy computational complexity or lack of mobility support. In this paper we propose an energy efficient method to fortify sensor networks against broadcast attacks using some key features of such networks like small transmission range and low reception-sensitivity. The main idea relies on modifying the reply timings of current MAC sub-layer protocols and embedding a two or three-way handshake protocol in broadcast scenarios so that the adversary receives a negative feedback from the network in response to his greediness in infecting nodes.

DIPS is activated based on the predicted threat level and risk assessment of the protected assets. Intrusions attempts are blocked based on (1) a serious attack that has already occurred (2) rate of packet flow (3) prediction of possible serious intrusions and (4) online risk assessment of the assets possibly available to the intruder.

In the early stages of deployment, the intrusion and security problems have not been seriously considered, although they could have a negative impact on VoIP deployment. In the paper, SIP intrusion detection and prevention requirements are analyzed and an IDS/IPS architecture is proposed. A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service. Hence, the performance of the proposed architecture has been evaluated in terms of impact that its operation has on the QoS experienced by the VoIP users.","","1-4244-0144-5","","10.1109/VOIPMS.2006.1638122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638122","","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Data security;Delay;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Quality of service;Switches","Internet telephony;public domain software;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","IDS-IPS architecture;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;TCP;UDP;VoIP deployment;data network;network-based intrusion detection;open-source software Snort;prevention technique;protocol analysis;quality of service;session initiation protocol;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol","","17","3","13","","","3 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

However, it is time and memory consuming for large datasets. This study proposed a parameter-free method to accelerate NNR. This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed parameter-free classification algorithm is very easy to operate and gives consideration to speed and accuracy.","","978-1-4244-0973-0","978-1-4244-0973-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370457","Accelerating;Classification;Clustering;Nearest neighbor;Parameter-Free","Acceleration;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Training data","pattern classification;pattern clustering","class-based clustering;cluster representations;fast nearest neighbor classification;nearest neighbor rule;parameter-free classifier","","1","","18","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the pattern dividing, the variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.

One such treacherous threat to all critical assets of an organization is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Since APT attack vector is not previously known, consequently this can harm the organization's assets before the patch for this security flaw is released/available. This paper presents a preliminary research effort to counter the APT or zero day attacks at an early stage by detecting malwares.

As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment.

But as the game between attackers and defenders goes further into payload confusion, the approximate string matching technology is needed, especially large-scale approximate multiple string matching technology. In this paper, we propose one practical algorithm, LargePEX, for large scale approximate multiple string matching based on edit distance. The algorithm is basically extended from PEX, an algorithm of approximate single string matching, with the idea of filtering and verification. LargePEX is finely designed to fit for large-scale matching using fine grain steps analyses. Some experiments are presented to verify the efficiency of LargePEX. As the results show, for the set of 10k strings, the average network payload checking speed using this algorithm can achieve 25 MBps-40 MBps, enough for 100 Mbps Ethernet. With hardware upgrading, the algorithm is also practical for Gigabit Ethernet. So LargePEX provides a new way for defenders to develop more effective methods to protect valuable resources and prevent intrusions by payload checking.","","1-4244-0463-0","1-4244-0463-0","10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4149803","","Computer security;Ethernet networks;Filtering algorithms;Information security;Large-scale systems;National security;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection;Sequences","local area networks;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","Ethernet;LargePEX;edit distance;filtering;fine grain steps analyses;hardware upgrading;intrusion prevention;large-scale approximate multiple string matching;network security;payload checking;valuable resource protection;verification","","0","","11","","","25-27 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences.

Their ability of self-organization, built-in redundancy and operational capabilities without needing human intervention make Wireless Sensor Networks suitable for such remote monitoring applications. But the unattended operation of WSNs and limited processing capabilities of the individual nodes make them vulnerable to a variety of security attacks, especially disruption of information flow or data corruption. For wired or wireless ad-hoc networks, there exist several automated systems for maintaining their functional integrity. Unfortunately, these strategies are not directly applicable to WSNs since ad-hoc networks are not as resource constrained as WSNs.This paper tries to develop distributed algorithms for detecting anomalous activity in information flow patterns in large-scale sensor networks.

In a distributed intrusion detection system, information about the current situation and knowledge about attacks are exchanged, aggregated, fused, and correlated in a cooperative manner to overcome the limitations of conventional centralized intrusion detection systems. However, this distributed approach introduces new challenges such as self-organization and efficient communication techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for developing, simulating, and deploying a distributed intrusion detection system that consists of several collaborating agents. The framework provides a programming interface and comprises all essential communication and synchronization methods that enables self-organized collaboration in a completely distributed manner. In two experiments we demonstrate the performance and capabilities of our implementation by simulating a large-scale worm outbreak and a one-to-many attack. Furthermore, we present two applications of our framework to show how collaboration of agents can be used to detect one-to-many attacks and how detection performance benefits from cooperation of agents.","","978-1-4244-3782-5","978-4-9904-2590-6","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045947","","Application software;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer simulation;Data acquisition;Data analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems","security of data;software agents;synchronisation","collaborative intrusion detection systems;computer network security;conventional centralized intrusion detection systems;distributed intrusion detection;large-scale simulation;programming interface;self-organized collaboration;synchronization methods","","1","","33","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SPIE system has been proven to work effectively and efficiently for IP version 4, largely because an IPv4 packet has sufficient entropy in the first 28 bytes to allow the hash functions to ""uniquely"" identify each packet.

However, CAMs are inefficient in matching a numeric range with existing encoding methods. Two-hot, binary and Gray encodings exhibit a depth scalability problem where the CAM depth required increases with the maximum number M in the range. One-hot and Johnson encodings exhibit poor CAM width scalability O(M). We present a unique hybrid encoding scheme mixing the features of two-hot and Johnson codes to solve both scalability problems. For an arbitrary range, it uses only three CAM entries in depth regardless of M, and has a width scaling of O(radicM ).

The cloud computing has lended many user friendly features in terms of various services available through internet but the harsh reality about cloud computing is that they are prone to security threat attacks. One of the major concerning security threats is called Distributed Denial of service attack (DDOS). DDOS attack destroys the ability of the system to provide service by overwhelming the bandwidth of network device and saturating the computation resources of service provider. This paper describes experimental analysis of impact of flooding DDOS attack in cloud environment through simulation in cloudsim.

Thus, Hybrid routing approach is needed to carry out the routing using both proactive and reactive approaches. The paper proposes a Hybrid Routing algorithm which utilizes the benefits of both reactive and proactive routing in MANETs.

Specifically we perform anonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and then make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for security analysis capability.

This symmetric-key cipher is compatible with yet lighter in hardware than the Advanced Encryption Standard and enables the implementation of cryptographic functionality with low complexity and power consumption. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%. Finally, both application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate array implementations of the proposed error detection structures are presented to assess their efficiency and overhead.

For intrusion detection method based support vector machine (SVM), there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so it's impractical to directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance. So it is worth applying and popularizing.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","978-0-7695-3816-7","10.1109/AICI.2009.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5375980","extension clustering;intrusion detection;support vector machine","Artificial intelligence;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Delay;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","security of data;support vector machines","extension clustering support vector machine;intrusion detection algorithm;response time","","0","","13","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An example is to estimate traffic with common strings in the payload and detect potential virus signatures for early alarm generation. We develop a fast, memory efficient algorithm for solving this problem as a variant of the longest common subsequence problem.

Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538","Keywords—Local monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.","Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication","","6","","39","","2010-12-30","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper two anomaly intrusion detection methods are proposed for peer-to-peer system. The main characters of the methods are that they can detect intrusion in real-time without any expert knowledge and attack signatures. One method uses hidden Markov model to check reflector DoS attacks, another based on adaptive resonance theory, which can learn the normal behavior with unsupervised method. The experimental P2P system is built on FreePastry 1.401 and JDK 1.5.0.

Detecting anomalies is hence critical both to protect against misuse and attacks, but is subject to constraints. These include primarily efficiency, but also legal and contractual restrictions limiting the depth of intrusiveness, which can be achieved by an intrusion detection system. In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes. This, together with the efficiency and efficacy of the approach is shown through experiments and statistical analysis in a Linux KVM-based reference scenario.

However, due to huge amounts of log files in large-scale IPTV system, it is not easy to perform deep analysis for various metrics on time. The volume of log data is expected to increase rapidly because of the explosive growth of users. For the efficient management of analysis jobs for diverse metrics under a large set of log data, in this paper, we propose MapReduce-based IPTV log analysis methods on the cloud computing platform, called Hadoop.

Research has shown that the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable distributed application and devices to device communication, even on very resource constrained devices, and thus play an important role for IoT and CPS. In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured. Security mechanisms for resource constrained devices has attracted much interest from the academic community, where research groups have shown solutions like IPsec, VPN-tunnels, (D)TLS, etc. are feasible to use on this type of networks. However, even though the use of well-known security mechanisms are vital for SOA-based IoT/CPS networks and systems to be protected, they do not provide any fine-grain access control. In this paper, a CoAP-based framework for service-level access control on low-power devices is presented. The framework allows fine grain access control on a per service and method basis. For example, by using this approach a device can allow read/write access to its services to one group of users while only allowing read access to another group. Users without the right credentials are not even allowed to discover available services. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, several implementations are presented together with test results. The aim is to provide a holistic framework for secure SOA-based low power networks comprise by resource constrain devices.","","","","10.1109/IECON.2014.7049308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7049308","","Access control;Authentication;IP networks;Protocols;Servers;Service-oriented architecture","Internet of Things;authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;service-oriented architecture;telecommunication power management","CoAP based Internet of Things;access control framework;authentication framework;available service discovery;constrained application protocol;cyber-physical systems;device communication;fine grain access control;low power device;resource constrain device;right credentials;security mechanisms;service level access control;service oriented architecture","","0","","20","","","Oct. 29 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, a well-known back-propagation neural network combined with the roulette wheel selection method and pseudo-random rule are combined with back propagation network (BPN) to determine the intrusion packet type. KDDCUP99 data sets were used as the evaluation packet samples of this experiment.

This paper tries to exploit some interesting concepts proposed by the new danger theory to overcome the problems associated with the self and non-self model. That by improving NSA in order to achieve better detection rates by integrating the basic danger concepts. In this approach, the intrusion detection is related to the damage that can occur in the system and that can be caused by both external elements such as internal elements. The proposed algorithm integrates and combines the basic concepts of intrusion detection systems IDS based on the role of T cells described by the negative selection algorithm, with those inspired by the role of dendritic cells to process the alarm signals and to judge thereafter whether there is presence of a dangerous element or not.","","978-1-4799-6608-0","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990233","Ad hoc networks;Artificial Immune Systems;Danger theory;Intrusion detection;Negative selection;Security","Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Sociology;Statistics","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET security;NSA;artificial immune systems;danger theory concepts;dendritic cells;intrusion detection system;negative selection algorithm","","0","","12","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of works which aim to protect these components generally consist in developing protections (or countermeasures) taken one by one. But this ""countermeasure-centered"" approach drastically decreases the performances of the whole chip in terms of power and speed. Our work is complementary and consists in reorganising a given set of existing countermeasures in order to optimise both the security and the availability of the circuit without reducing its global performances. The proposed solution is based on a double-processor architecture and on mechanisms to parametrise the hardware and software countermeasures. One processor embeds the state-of-the-art set of countermeasures and executes the application code. The second processor, much smaller, applies the strategy of security (i.e the response of the circuit when a security event arises), but without sharing sensitive data with the first processor. We show that our approach enables the secure circuit's designer to easily fine tune the strategy of security, for example, of Pay-TV applications and could, in the future, be used to optimise dynamically the trade-off between performance and security.","2157-4952","978-1-4244-8705-9","978-1-4244-8703-5","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5721145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5721145","","Cryptography;Hardware;Monitoring;Sensors;Smart cards;Software","embedded systems;security of data;software architecture","complex strategy;countermeasure centered approach;double processor architecture;intrusion detection system;secret information recovery;secure embedded system","","0","","9","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to measure the effectiveness of these breach detection systems, we propose a new type of test methodology. Our approach is based on that advanced attackers who can bypass the existing layers of security have the time, skill and resources to create unknown malware, with advanced bypass capabilities. We will evaluate a hybrid approach, where the IP / domain of the attacker C&C server is simulated in one case, and real in another case.
