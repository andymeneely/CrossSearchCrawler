The success rate of contest participants was evaluated in terms of the obtained classification cost. The classification cost of the contest winner was 0.2331, the best approach prior to our work carries the classification cost of 0.2224. We show that a simple approach based on cascading classification leads to the classification cost of 0.2079. Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples. We argue that cascading classification is a viable alternative in scenarios where less complex machine learning approaches are favorable, for example due to possible performance degradation in resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems or sensors.","2166-0662","978-1-4799-3857-5","","10.1109/ISMS.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280878","Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH);KDD99 classifier learning contest;cascading classification;intrusion detection;k-nearest-neighbor classification","Accuracy;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Probes;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","cascading classification;clustering approach;machine learning;network intrusion detection","","","","","","","27-29 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Statistical signatures are based on modeling of normal requests and their distribution value without explicit intervention. Several attributes are used to calculate the behavior of the legitimate request on the web server. SS-IDS is best suited for the newly installed web servers which doesnpsilat have large number of requests in the data set to train the IDS and can be used on top of currently used signature based IDS like SNORT.

Most of the systems that perform deep packet inspection implement basic string matching algorithms to match packets against large but finite strings. However, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power. DFA is employed to implement regular expression matching. DFA representations of a regular expression sets in network applications require large amounts of memory, limiting their practical application.

Under the framework of Internet worm tomography, we attempt to infer Internet worm temporal behaviors, i.e., the host infection time and the worm infection sequence, and thus pinpoint patient zero or initially infected hosts. Specifically, we apply statistical estimation techniques and propose method of moments, maximum likelihood, and linear regression estimators. We show analytically and empirically that our proposed estimators can better infer worm temporal characteristics than a naive estimator that has been used in the previous work.

As underlying devices in SDN, SDN switches must maintain a large number of hardware counters. Implementation of these counters faces serious challenges for SDN switches, i.e., High memory consumption and inflexibility. Thus, we previously proposed Software Defined Hardware Counters (SDHC), which decouples definition and implementation of counters to overcome these challenges. However, like traditional hardware counters, SDHC only supports passive statistical mode (i.e., The values of the counters can be only read passively by the controller). Based on the passive mode, most of applications need to send request messages at some frequency to obtain statistics, which causes some critical problems for SDN: i) low statistical accuracy, ii) high network bandwidth consumption. Hyper Software Defined Hardware Counters (Hyper SDHC) is thus proposed by extending SDHC. Through introducing the timer-triggering and updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms, Hyper SDHC can naturally support active statistical mode, i.e., Counters actively report their values according to triggering condition. It can greatly enhance the statistical accuracy and reduce network bandwidth consumption between controller and switch. The demo of Hyper SDHC is implemented based on Net Magic platform. The demo will exhibit how Hyper SDHC works and how it supports a typical video quality monitor application.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037744","Software Defined Networking (SDN);active statistical mode;counters","Bandwidth;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Software;Switches","software defined networking;statistical analysis","Net Magic platform;SDHC;SDN switches;hyper software defined hardware counters;low statistical accuracy;network bandwidth consumption;software defined networking;timer-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms;updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms","","0","","8","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability.

T2 FL is an extension of Type-1 FL which proved to be successful in modeling and minimizing the effects of various kinds of dynamic uncertainties. In this paper, T2 FL provides a basis for robust anomaly detection and cyber security state awareness.

In this paper we address this issue by investigating effective solutions to automatically identify compromised machines in a network. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only 7 internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062096","","Aggregates;Condition monitoring;Error analysis;Internet;Power generation economics;Probability;Recruitment;Sequential analysis;Statistical analysis;Unsolicited electronic mail","IP networks;Internet;electronic messaging;probability;security of data;statistical testing;unsolicited e-mail","DDoS;IP addresses;Internet;SPOT;U.S. campus network;compromised machines;identity theft;outgoing messages monitoring;security attacks;security threats;sequential probability ratio test;spam zombie detection system;spam zombies detection;spamming activity;statistical tool","","0","3","13","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The big data processing is done through HAMR, which is a next generation in-memory MapReduce engine. HAMR has reported high speedups over existing big data solutions across several analytics algorithms. The analytics engine comprises a novel ensemble algorithm, which extracts training data from clusters of the multiple IDS alarms. The clustering is utilized as a preprocessing step to re-label the datasets based on their high similarity to known potential attacks.

In spite of their attractive applications, MANET poses high security problems compared to conventional wired and wireless networks due to its unique characteristics such as lack of central coordination, dynamic topology, temporary network life and wireless nature of communication. Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy. Proposed IDS architecture uses the combination of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make use of the excellent accuracy of SVM and better performance of RST.","","978-1-4799-3835-3","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033949","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Mobile ad hoc Networks;Rough Set Theory and Support Vector Machine;Security issues","Approximation methods;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Set theory;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","IDS architecture;MANET;RST;SVM;ad hoc technology;attack prevention measures;authentication techniques;centralized management;dynamic topology;encryption;highly resource constrained nodes;instant wireless networking;intrusion detection systems;machine learning;mobile ad hoc networking;mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security problems;support vector machine;temporary network life;wired networks;wireless devices","","0","","10","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At a future point in time, the Web page is reprocessed for client side executable content and the content rehashed, with any differences in the hash values indicative of a potential XSS attack. It is believed that the described IDS technique would be particularly useful for Web forums and other user content driven site, since the IDS only considers content recognized as potentially executable and not normal text content, such as that which would be typically enclosed in paragraph or heading tags.","","978-1-4577-1342-2","","10.1109/LISAT.2012.6223107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223107","Perl;XSS;information security;intrusion detection","Browsers;HTML;Intrusion detection;Vectors;Web pages","Perl;Web sites;security of data","Perl based IDS technique;Web page;Web sites;XSSmon;intrusion detection system;potential XSS attack detection;potential client side executable content;potential cross site scripting attack detection","","2","","5","","","4-4 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pattern matching systems are not able to cope with high bandwidth (10 Gbps +) when analyzing the whole payload. Furthermore, new attack schemes arise by increasingly complex software and systems. New approaches like network behavior analyses (NBA) systems show promise for being able to cope with the new threats. These systems evaluate statistical flow data generated from the traffic of the monitored network. While originally designed for optimising traffic handling and accounting in the network, flow data appeared to be powerful for intrusion detection. NBA Systems based on machine learning techniques are able to evaluate these data and to recognize anomalies in the network. However, these systems suffer from a long-lasting learning phase and are susceptible to manipulations during that time. To overcome these shortcomings, we are introducing a fast-learning modular neural network based on pre-processed components.

The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour.

In this paper, we propose a cloud-based smartphone-specific intrusion detection and response engine, which continuously performs an in-depth forensics analysis on the smartphone to detect any misbehavior. In case a misbehavior is detected, the proposed engine decides upon and takes optimal response actions to thwart the ongoing attacks.

L-WMxD , which works on a lexical based mutation engine, is an active defense system to discover XSS before the Webmail application is online for service. The engine is initialized by normal JavaScript code called seed. Then, rules are applied to the sensitive strings in the seed which are picked out through a lexical parser. After that, the mutation engine issues multiple test cases. Newly-generated test cases are used for XSS test. Two prototype tools are realized by us to send the newly-generated test cases to various Webmail servers to discover XSS vulnerability. Experimental results of L-WMxD are quite encouraging. We have run L-WMxD over 26 real-world Webmail applications and found vulnerabilities in 21 Webmail services, including some of the most widely used Yahoo!Mail, Mirapoint Webmail and ORACLE' Collaboration Suite Mail.","","978-1-4577-0249-5","978-1-4577-0248-8","10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928954","L-WMxD;Webmail;XSS;fuzzer","Browsers;Electronic mail;Encoding;HTML;Security;Servers;Transforms","Java;electronic mail;grammars;security of data","JavaScript code;L-WMxD;Mirapoint Webmail;ORACLE collaboration suite mail;Webmail XSS fuzzer;Webmail services;Yahoo Mail;active defense system;cross-site scripting;lexical based Webmail XSS discoverer;lexical based mutation engine;lexical parser;prototype tools;seed","","0","","25","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply our tool to Linux kernel 2.4.32 and identify 141,279 global invariants that are critical to its runtime integrity. Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector. Our experience suggests that static analysis is a viable option for automated integrity property derivation, and it can have very low false positive rate (1 out of 141,280 in our Linux kernel case study) and very low false negative rate (about 0.013%).","","978-1-4673-0683-6","978-1-936968-32-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144814","integrity modeling;invariants detection;static analysis;tools","Analytical models;Hardware;Software","Linux;operating system kernels;program assemblers;program diagnostics;source coding","Linux kernel 2.4.32;array sensitivity;assembly code handling;automated integrity property derivation;commodity operating systems kernel;dynamic invariant detector;false alarms;field sensitivity;integrity models;pointer analysis;program runtime behavior modeling;runtime attestation;runtime integrity;static analysis-based global invariant detection tool;static source code analysis","","0","","34","","","15-18 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.","","","","10.1109/EAIT.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032","Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node","Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV","data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack","","0","","18","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, unlike devices that have a limited and predefined set of functionality, recent mobile smart phone devices have a very rich set of components and can handle multiple general purpose programs that are not a-priori known or profiled. In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the power consumption of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258304","energy model;power usage measurements;smart handheld devices","Brightness;Discharges (electric);Image color analysis;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Power demand;Power measurement","","","","12","","20","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes use a trust based transmission method based on previous records of successful packet transmission. Nodes which violate this relay of packets and cause denial of service attack in the form flooding of large packets may cause congestion which needs to be detected. Whenever congestion occurs then the senders should lower their transmission rate, but if certain senders do not do this, it can be found by the destination by comparing it with the previous sending rate. When both the rates are equal, the corresponding sender is considered as an attacker and has to be removed from the existing path. Such type of node is continuously sending the control and data packets in the network, hindering the connection establishment. An adaptive approach is proposed which involves taking an alternate path to the destination which is less congested in order to complete the message transfer.","2347-9337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012833","Congestion;flooding;wireless network","Conferences;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;trusted computing","adaptive approach;denial of service attack;distributed detection;infrastructureless wireless network;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;packet flooding;trust based transmission method","","0","","10","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distinguishing different anomaly patterns from large amount of data can be a challenge, let alone visualizing them in a comparative perspective. Recently, the unsupervised learning method such as the K-means [3], self-organizing map (SOM) [2], and growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) [1] have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection [4][5]. However, there is no study addressing both mining and detecting task. This study leverages the advantage of GHSOM to analyze the network traffic data and visualize the distribution of attack patterns with hierarchical relationship. In the mining stage, the geometric distances between each pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space. The density and the sample size of each node can help to detect anomalous network traffic. In the detecting stage, this study extends the traditional GHSOM and uses the support vector machine (SVM) [6] to classify network traffic data into the predefined categories. The proposed approach achieves (1) help understand the behaviors of anomalous network traffic data (2) provide effective classification rule to facilitate network anomaly detection and (3) accumulate network anomaly detection knowledge for both mining and detecting purpose. The public dataset and the private dataset are used to evaluate the proposed approach.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a prevailing technology due to its wide range of applications in military and civilian domains. These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency. In this paper multipath routing scheme is used as defense mechanism against selective forwarding attack. When a node detects packet drop during the routing, it will resend the packet through alternate route. Due to the resending mechanism reliability of the routing scheme is improved.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726833","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","defense mechanism;multipath routing;packet drop detection;routing reliability;security attack;selective forwarding attack;selective packet dropping;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the steps of the attack plan performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model.

Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

Many clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, most of them implicitly assume that nodes behave honestly in the clustering process. In practice, there might be some malicious nodes trying to manipulate the clustering process to make them serve as clusterheads, which can obtain some special power, e.g., eavesdropping more messages. In this paper we present a secure weighted clustering algorithm (SWCA). SWCA uses the weighted clustering algorithm (WCA) for clustering and TELSA for efficiently authenticating packets. We propose a novel neighbor verification scheme to check whether the values of election-related features (e.g., node degree) are forged by malicious nodes. Also, we theoretically analyze the probability for a malicious node to tamper node degree without being detected and derive a lower bound on the probability. Finally, simulation results show that SWCA is secure but still has comparable performance with WCA. To the best of our knowledge, SWCA is the first algorithm considering the security of 1-hop type clustering (in this type only the clusterhead can communicate with ordinary members directly) in ad hoc networks.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-2947-9","978-1-4244-2948-6","10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4917979","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Clustering algorithms;Communications Society;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Security;Software algorithms","ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","QoS;ad hoc networks;broadcasting;malicious node probability;packet authentication;routing;secure weighted clustering algorithm;wireless ad hoc networks","","1","","26","","","5-8 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the detection protocol, different nodes play different roles, and use different monitor schemes. Virtual cluster head and monitor nodes are elected. Monitor nodes monitor cluster head, and report to virtual cluster head. Virtual cluster head broadcasts abnormal cluster head to all member nodes, and initiates a new cluster head election. Member nodes are monitored by their cluster head. Simulation shows that, the detection protocol can real-time predict traffic attacks, and consume less energy.

In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network.

The system makes the most of rough set theory and linear SVM to reduce the redundancies of data sets and improve the detection rate of EDS. The simulation experiment shows this approach has higher ratio of correct classification, while shortens training time of the classifier in a wide range, which is going to a pretty momentous improvement in real-time detection. On the other hand, this approach has reduced memory usage and improved the generalization ability of the system.","","978-1-4244-4994-1","","10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5364978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364978","","Artificial intelligence;Automation;Data mining;Decision trees;Hybrid intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Set theory;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","EDS detection rate improvement;data sets redundancies reduction;linear SVM;memory usage reduction;multiclass linear support vector machine;network intrusion detection system;rough set theory","","1","","15","","","19-20 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the available theoretical references for guiding the designer of these agents, there are few proposed testing techniques to validate these systems. It's known that this validation depends on all the selected test cases, which should provide information regarding the components in the structure of the agent that show unsatisfactory performance. This article presents the application of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), through Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG), for the problem of optimization of selection of test cases for testing computing systems that are based on intelligent agents. In order to validate the use of CLONALG, comparisons between the Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms (ACO) techniques were performed. In the experiments with the approach testing intelligent agents with different types of architecture in partially and completely observable environments, the approach selected a group of satisfactory test cases in terms of the generated information about the irregular performance of the agent. From this result, the approach enables the identification of problematic episodes, allowing the designer to make objective changes in the internal structure of the agent in such a way to improve its performance.","","","","10.1109/CEC.2015.7256936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7256936","","Cloning;Genetic algorithms;Intelligent agents;Search problems;Sociology;Statistics;Testing","artificial immune systems;multi-agent systems;program testing","ACO techniques;AIS;CLONALG;GA techniques;ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial immune systems;clonal selection algorithm;complex distributed systems;genetic algorithms techniques;intelligent agents test;internal structure","","","","","","","25-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Significant research efforts have been made to address the problem of misbehavior detection. However, little research work has been done to distinguish truly malicious behaviors from the faulty behaviors. Both the malicious behaviors and the faulty behaviors are generally equally treated as misbehaviors without any further investigation by most of the traditional misbehavior detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose and develop a policy-based malicious peer detection mechanism, in which context information, such as communication channel status, buffer status, and transmission power level, is collected and then used to determine whether the misbehavior is likely a result of malicious activity or not. Simulation results illustrate that the policy-based malicious peer detection mechanism is able to distinguish malicious peers from faulty peers with high confidence. Moreover, the mechanism converges to a consistent view of malicious nodes amongst all the nodes with a limited communication overhead.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283307","","Ad hoc networks;Communication channels;Computer networks;Context;Fault detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MANET;buffer status;communication channel status;error-prone transmission media;highly dynamic network topology;misbehavior detection;mobile ad hoc network;policy-based malicious peer detection;rigorous power constraint","","3","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These typically involve monitoring or surveillance of animals or humans, infrastructure, or territories. Since security as well as privacy play an increasingly important role in these contexts, sensor nodes and sensor networks need to be protected from spurious environmental effects and malicious attacks. In addition to attacks known from conventional wireless networks, the specific properties of WSNs lead to new kinds of attack. Moreover, countermeasures are subject to strict resource limitations of the motes and, therefore, have to be light-weight and effective at the same time. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive security architecture for WSNs, consisting of different attack types (including WSN-specific attacks) and countermeasures. Second, we propose a modular Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a framework for this architecture. Finally, we give details on selected modules and discuss practical implementation issues.","","978-1-4673-1784-9","978-1-4673-1785-6","10.1109/INSS.2012.6240521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240521","Intrusion detection;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Jamming;Servers;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","WSN specific attack;attack countermeasure;environmental effect;malicious attack;modular intrusion detection system;security architecture;wireless sensor networks","","3","","22","","","11-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that court like IDS is effective in many aspects, especially the capability to prevent malicious alerts and reduce false positive rate. To further prove its effectiveness, we then apply CCIDS in securing the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol to solve two most severe attacks-link spoofing and link deletion.

In the context of work carried on standards for online laboratories we pretend define methods for storing and retrieving learning objects for remote laboratories. The objective of this standard is also define methods for linking learning objects to design and implement smart learning environments and software components or objets for remote online laboratories The objects defined by this standard are, for example, interfaces for devices connected to user computers over computers networks and the devices themselves. They are also learning scenarios or collaboration tools for communications necessary to conduct an activity of practical online laboratory work, they will allow to design and implement mechanisms that make smart learning environment formed by the ad hoc aggregation of learning objects taking always into account the pedagogical context for their use. This will allow to easy design and implement the pedagogically driven remote laboratory environment and experiments as also is learning environments. The experiences and laboratories are build using the parts and separate components that we have in a separate “virtual closet” with parts, components, and already build experiences. To build this complex network we need to find a system that supports effectively this structure. This probably will be an enormous database of v-labs and independent elements, where will be possible sometimes to “recycle” some of the elements. For this structure we propose an Ontology because it allows to “re-use” the same element several times in m- ny experiences, and provide a very detailed description of each kind of element through is classes and sub-classes.","2165-9559","978-1-4673-6111-8","978-1-4673-6109-5","10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530257","CMS;E-learning;Ontology;Remote Laboratory;V-labs;Virtual Labs;distributed instrumentation","Business;Ontologies;Remote laboratories;Semantic Web;Standards;User interfaces","complex networks;computer aided instruction;computer networks;information retrieval;laboratory techniques;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","collaboration tools;complex network;computer networks;learning object retrieval;learning object storage;online experiences;ontology based online laboratory;pedagogical context;pedagogically driven remote laboratory environment;practical online laboratory work;remote online laboratories;smart learning environments;software components;user computers;v-labs database;virtual closet;virtual laboratory network","","0","","37","","","13-15 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on a set of simulated intrusions, we established a comparative experimental study of four IDSs, showing that most of current IDS are generally centralized and suffer from significant limitations when used in high speed networks, especially when they face distributed attacks. This leads us to use distributed model based on mobile agents paradigm.

However, existing parallel schemes often fail to achieve linear speedup in IDS. The throughput even deteriorates severely for some network traffics. Hence, exploring and addressing the problems have become one of the most urgent issues in parallel IDS. In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system. Second, we propose a new fingerprint extraction strategy to deal with HRF. Experimental results show that the throughput deterioration is resolved completely and the throughput is enhanced by 45% by integrating our proposed method into the test bed and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120879","Intrusion Detection System;Snort;multi-core;pre-fliter;software pipeline","","","","","0","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such dependencies provide meaningful information concerning the overall system dynamics and should be explicitly integrated into the burst detection process. Using both synthetic scenarios and two real-world datasets, we compare our method with an existing burst-detection algorithm.
