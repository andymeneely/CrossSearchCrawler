Most of these ICSs are not designed with security protection nowadays, so there is an increasing demand of designing protection mechanism in infrastructure of industrial plants. In this paper, we propose multi-agent intrusion detection architecture and a feature selection approach to protect ICS. Multi-agent intrusion detection system (MIDS) architecture is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks, so it can make intrusion detection system (IDS) efficient and scalable, while the feature detection approach is proposed to improve detection reliability. We chose NSL-KDD as experimental data and had a test on four kinds of attacks (Probe, Dos, U2R and R2L) to evaluate the performance of IDS. Compared with four other common feature selection algorithms (IG, GR, Relief and Chi-Square), the experimental results show that our method can effectively improve True Positive Rate and reduce False Positive Rate of IDS.","","978-1-4799-5389-9","","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6998383","feature selection;industrial control system;intrusion detection system;multi-agent","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Industrial control;Intrusion detection;Probes","Internet;computer network security;feature selection;multi-agent systems;reliability","ChiSquare;Dos;ICS;IDS;Internet;MIDS architecture;NSL-KDD;Probe;R2L;ReliefF;U2R;corporate network;decentralized intrusion detection;feature selection approach;industrial control system;industrial plants;large switched networks;multiagent intrusion detection system architecture;network attacks;prevention control","","0","","12","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we design an incentive model based on trust management by using game theory for peers to collaborate truthfully without free-riding in an IDN environment. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in an incentive compatible manner. Using duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium.

Among many network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), open source systems have gained substantial preference due to their flexibility, support and cost effectiveness. Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware. However; Snort detection capability is not improved by improving hardware and is dependent upon its internal architecture (signature database and rate filtration). Furthermore, the findings can be applied to other signature based intrusion detection systems for refining their performance and detection capability.","","978-1-4799-1287-2","","10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725321","Distributes Denial of Service;Network Intrusion Detection System;Network Security;Penetration Testing;Snort;Vulnerability Assessment and Defense","Availability;Computer crime;Floods;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Servers","computer network security;public domain software;transport protocols","DDoS attacks;NIDS;Snort detection capability;Snort packet handling capability;TCP flooding distributed denial of service attack;detection accuracy;hardware configurations;internal architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network security;open source systems;rate filtration;signature database","","1","","26","","","11-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity. The results are valuable in both cyber and physical domains.

The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets or timing jitter. Such evasion techniques cause most of the previous timing-based detection algorithms to fail. In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others. We examine the selected parameters and provide different trade-offs among false rates. Our experiments report a very good performance with very high detection rate and low false detection rate when using carefully selected parameter values.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066459","Stepping-stone;connection chain;data mining;intrusion detection;network security","Association rules;Computer security;Cryptography;Data mining;Delay;Delta modulation;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing;Timing jitter","Internet;data mining;security of data;telecommunication network routing","Internet;evasion technique;false detection rate;modified association rule mining;network intrusion detection system;network routing;stepping-stone connection detection","","0","","13","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of lightweight IDS. The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility. To design the proposed system, several experiments have been conducted, and they indicate that the proposed lightweight IDS can deliver satisfactory system performance.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283334","Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Decision Function;features classification.;features ranking;features selection","Data engineering;Fuzzy sets;IP networks;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Scalability;System performance;System testing;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP/IP network model;application layer IDS;feature selection;fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function algorithm;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS classification scheme;link layer IDS;network layer IDS;network security;transport layer IDS","","1","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem arises in various fields, such as computational biology and network security. But the problem is not extensively studied as the single pattern case and there is no efficient algorithm for this problem. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms. Let P = {p<sub>1</sub>, . . . , p<sub>k</sub>} be a set of patterns with wildcards where the total length of patterns is |P|, and a text t of length n over alphabet a1 , . . . ,a<sub>σ</sub>. We present two algorithms for this problem where patterns are matched simultaneously. The first algorithm finds the matches of a small set of patterns in the text in O(n log |P| + nk) time. The words used in the algorithm are of size k[2 lg σ] + X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈Ig |p<sub>i</sub>|⌉ bits. The second one finds the matchings of patterns in the text in time O(n log |P| log σ + nk) by computing the Hamming distance between the patterns and the text. The algorithm uses the words with X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈lg |p<sub>i</sub>| bits. We also demonstrate an FFT implementation based on the modular arithmetic for machines with word size of 64 bits. Finally, we show that both algorithms can be easily parallelized and the parallelized algorithms are given as well.","","978-1-4244-9482-8","","10.1109/PAAP.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715080","Algorithm;FFT;Multi-pattern matching;Wildcards","Arrays;Computer science;Convolution;Electronic mail;Hamming distance;Pattern matching;Program processors","Hamming codes;fast Fourier transforms;set theory;string matching;text analysis","Hamming distance;fast Fourier transform;pattern matching;set of pattern;wildcard","","0","","13","","","18-20 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks.

Cyber attacks could block the connection between SCADA Control Centre and its remote devices or insert fake commands/measurements in the equipment communications. With reference to an actual case study, constituted by a SCADA system controlling a portion of a medium voltage power grid and a corporate network, we discuss how cyber threats, vulnerabilities and attacks might degrade the functionalities of SCADA and corporate network, which, in turn, might lead to outages of the electrical grid. We represent SCADA and corporate network under malware propagation, Denial of Service and Man In The Middle attacks and predict their consequent performance degradation.

Sub sequently, GAIS utilizes this probabilistic model for sampling new solutions. Thus, the algorithm takes into account the relationships among the variables of the problem, avoiding the disruption of already obtained high-quality partial solutions (building blocks). Besides the capability to identify and manipulate building blocks, the algorithm maintains diversity in the population, performs multimodal optimization and adjusts the size of the population automatically according to the problem. These attributes are generally absent from alternative algorithms, and all were shown to be useful attributes when optimizing the weights of MLPs, thus guiding to high-performance classifiers.

This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.","","978-1-4673-2164-8","","10.1109/HPCC.2012.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332322","Denial of Service;Neural Network;Security;Support Vector Machine;Wireless Sensor Networks","Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;real-time systems;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attack probability detection;MAC;SVM;WSN;denial of service;machine learning;medium access control;neural network;real-time system monitoring;security enhancement;security flaw;support vector machine;wireless sensor network","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection. Simulation results show effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4244-7837-8","978-0-7695-4158-7","10.1109/CICSyN.2010.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615975","Cluster;Denial of service attack;Intrusion detection;Security;Wireless ad hoc networks","","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;pattern clustering;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized monitoring points;cluster heads;clustered wireless ad hoc networks;co-operative algorithms;distributed intrusion detection architecture;infrastructure protocols;intermittent wireless communications;intrusion related message communication;mobile agents;network security;node clustering","","2","","15","","","28-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using signal processing techniques and cooperative signal processing, we can detect any passing ships by distinguishing the ship-generated waves from the ocean waves. We design a three-tier intrusion detection system with which we propose to exploit spatial and temporal correlations of an intrusion to increase detection reliability. We conduct evaluations with real data collected in our initial experiments, and provide quantitative analysis of the detection system, such as the successful detection ratio, detection latency, and an estimation of an intruding vessel's velocity.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6086534","Ship detection;harbor protection.;surveillance security;target tracking;wireless sensor networks","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Marine vehicles;Ocean waves;Sea surface;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","accelerometers;correlation theory;geophysical signal processing;military vehicles;ocean waves;ships;signal detection;spatiotemporal phenomena;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","accelerometer sensor;border control;coast sea surface;cooperative signal processing;data collection;harbor protection;ocean wave;ship generated wave;ship intrusion detection;spatial correlation;surveillance security;temporal correlation;unauthorized marine vessel;wireless sensor network","","5","","","","2011-11-22","July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM. The evaluation shows our approach effectively protects a smart phone against excessive I/O attacks and guarantees availability.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522352","I/O access control;Virtual machine;smart phone security;virtual machine monitor","Access control;Batteries;Degradation;Equations;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;Secure storage;Security;Smart phones","","","","0","","23","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researching the efficient CSA method will be helpful to enhance the security protection ability of EPIN.

The Cyber-threats Situation Value (CSV) is used to describe the cyber-threats situation. The higher CSV shows worse security situation, on the contrary, the lower CSV shows the better. In order to determine the weights of all cyber-threats, the AHP is used to design the hierarchical CSA index system that could divide all cyber-threats into the “Strong”, “Medium” and “Weak” 3 grey clustering classes. At the same time, the GCA is used to construct the criteria layer of index system. The key components of CSV could be clearly shown by those above ways. The CSV value is the summation of products, which products are multiplied by the occurrences number of each cyber-threat and its weight.

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Our experimental results show that EliMet can optimally make use of prior knowledge as well as automated inference techniques to minimize human involvement and efficiently deduce the expert knowledge regarding individual states of that particular system.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-1624-8","978-1-4673-1623-1","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263941","Power grid critical infrastructure;intrusion detection and response;security metric;situational awareness","Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Security","control engineering computing;inference mechanisms;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system protection;power system security","EliMet;automated inference techniques;bulk electricity delivery system;complex power-grid control network protection;power grid critical infrastructures;security assessment techniques;security incidents;security measures;security metric elicitation","","4","","42","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, to obtain basic probability assignment (BPA) of evidence theory for all evidences, a novel method of getting evidences and objective BPA based on attribute importance is presented.

Honeypots are a tool supporting that task - they collect malware samples for analysis. Unfortunately, existing honeypots concentrate on malware that spreads over networks, thus missing any malware that does not use a network for propagation. A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device.

As a result, while large and resourceful organizations can afford the high cost of this technology, smaller security firms and security researchers are fundamentally constrained. We propose and build a shared infrastructure for deploying and monitoring honeypots, called HoneyLab, that is similar in spirit to PlanetLab. With an overlay and distributed structure of address space and computing resources, HoneyLab increases coverage and accelerates innovation among security researchers as well as security industry experts relying on honeypot-based attack detection technology.

An attacker may spoof the identity of legitimate users before implementing more serious attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that employ multi-layer approach to help towards mitigating network attacks, offer high detection accuracy rate and low numbers of false alarms. Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers. However, an important step to be investigated remains open; this is to find an automatic and self-adaptive process of Basic Probability Assignment (BPA). This paper describes a novel BPA methodology able to automatically adapt its detection capabilities to the current measured characteristics, with a light weight process of generating a baseline profile of normal utilisation and without intervention from the IDS administrator.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets. The results have shown an improvement in respect to detection rate and reduction of false positives.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474796","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;multi-stage attack","Data mining;Data security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Libraries;Mars;Redundancy;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data","DARPA 2000;alerts correlation techniques;attack patterns;detection techniques;extensional consequences parameters;knowledge-based model;low-level processing capacity;multistage attack recognition system;network intrusion detection systems;signature-based NIDS;signature-matching","","3","","22","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the flooding attack by applying multiple nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) algorithm to identify the flooding attacker nodes. It also takes the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the flooding attack and after applying the proposed REHIDAN algorithm is tested. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN algorithm reduces the effect of the attack by reducing the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","","978-1-4244-4704-6","978-1-4244-3474-9","10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010583","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay effects;Floods;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Testing","mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","dynamic network topology;flooding attack;on-demand distance vector routing protocol;real-time host intrusion detection;wireless ad-hoc networks","","2","","15","","","28-30 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an attacker may send forged packets to a router with the intention of changing or corrupting the routing table, which in turn can reduce the network connectivity and degrade the router functionalities. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like firewall, authentication mechanisms and intrusion detection system (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect network connectivity offered by routers. In this paper, we propose using honeypot to protect routing protocols. Honeypot is particularly useful to attract attackers, driving them away real routers and allowing the administrators to be aware about intrusion attempts on their networks and the employed techniques that can be recent. Our solution (honeypot router) is to deploy a honeypot playing the role of a router. The honeypot is based on routing software called Quagga and other tools for traffic capture and analysis. The entire solution supervises all routing traffic, so it detects and studies new attacks against routing protocols (RIP, OSPF and BGP).","2151-4763","978-1-4244-4498-4","978-1-4244-4499-1","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411968","Honeypot Router;routing attack detection;routing protocol;routing protocol protection","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer science;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Protection;Routing protocols;Security;Software tools;Telecommunication traffic","routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Quagga;authentication mechanisms;honeypot router;interconnecting networks;intrusion detection system;network connectivity protection;routing protocols protection;routing software;routing table;routing traffic;security techniques","","1","","26","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism in WSNs called green firewall. It can isolate an intruder with less overhead, and track the intruder to continually prevent the attack.

However, organizations that provide this information do not wish to expose the internal workings of their networks to potential attack. Traffic trace anonymization attempts to mitigate this concern by hiding sensitive information while preserving most of the empirical value of the trace. Unfortunately, many attacks such as statistical fingerprinting, known-plaintext, and port evaluation can serve to identify communications within a trace which can lead an attacker to the real-world identities of anonymized devices. The inherent graph structure embedded in network traffic stands as a primary lever in achieving such de-anonymization. We propose Netshuffle, a method that distorts the graph structure in the anonymized trace such that an attacker cannot rely on the edges (communications) to identify a particular end-node (device). In essence, we shuffle the edges of the graph like a deck of cards so that even if an attacker can identify an edge, that edge does not necessarily connect to the intended target. Thus, inferences based on features of communications will either lead an attacker astray, or force the attacker to guess as to the identity of the targeted node from several indistinguishable candidates. Netshuffle provides a complimentary vector of protection to current anonymization techniques at limited cost in data utility.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5962451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962451","","Equations;IEEE Communications Society;IP networks;Image edge detection;Merging;Peer to peer computing;Topology","IP networks;computer network security","Netshuffle;anonymized devices;deanonymization;graph distortion;inherent graph structure;known-plaintext;network traffic;port evaluation;statistical fingerprinting;traffic trace anonymization","","1","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Still, the interest of STM has not yet been demonstrated for reactive applications that require bounded response time for some of their operations. We propose to support such applications by allowing the developer to annotate some transaction blocks with deadlines. Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions.

The data breach is a biggest problem in cloud as the data are shared across the globe and sensitive information of the customer is stored at some third party storage site. Security of the data is the major concern in cloud from outsiders as well as insiders. Insider attack is the most devastating threat due to the familiarity of the underlying system to the insiders. The proposed approach mitigates this threat by a host based user profiling technique where a key stroke dynamics is used for analyzing the user behavior and a retraining approach is also proposed as the imposter patterns are absent at the time of registration.

Network security and privacy protection without a central manager will be challenging. Several security mechanisms and privacy protections will require the cooperation of several nodes to defend the network from malicious attacks. We particularly investigate when for each node it is cost-effective to freely participate in the security mechanism or protect its privacy depending if that node believes or trusts that all other nodes or at least a minimum number of other nodes will do the same. In this case, each node will be involved in a trust dilemma that we will model using the mathematical framework of game theory and evolutionary game theory.

The connection is retrieved to the original destination in case of false alarm recognition, while the actions are hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. The second contribution applies the game theoretic analysis in the sense that the contributing agents are led to perform the best they could in order to achieve their goals. The Shaply value is computed to find the actual contribution of each agent in the coalition he belongs to. The equilibrium point is found and consequently the winner coalition is formed.

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms. For example, we are able to construct a D <sup>2</sup>FA with over 80 000 000 states using only 1 GB of main memory in only 77 min.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807837","Deep packet inspection;information security;intrusion detection and prevention;network security;regular expression matching","Automata;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Minimization;Standards","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;telecommunication security","D<sup>2</sup>FA;NFA;RE;XFA;bypassing space explosion;delayed input DFA;deterministic finite state automata;expensive nondeterministic finite automata;extended finite automata;high-speed regular expression matching;minimize then union framework;network intrusion detection;network prevention systems;regular expression signatures;security threats;union then minimize framework","","2","","37","","2014-04-29","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we focus on the best relay selection and the optimization of the Physical-Layer Network Coding (PNC) at the relays, aiming at the throughput maximization of the network. Existing literature optimizes PNC with respect to the maximization of the minimum rate among users. The proposed strategy maximizes the sum rate of the users allowing non-symmetric rates, while the optimal solution is explored with the aid of the Pareto frontier. The problem of relay selection is matched to a coalition formation game, where the relays and the CD cooperate to maximize their profit. Efficient coalition formation algorithms are proposed, which perform joint relay selection and PNC optimization.

In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489","Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability","Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software","computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines","VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty","","1","","48","","","January 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since CCR is a device which is made up three mutually orthogonal mirrors, an incident ray sent toward CCR can be reflected back in the opposite direction of the incident ray. Using this characteristic, the distance between sensor node and source can be calculated by measuring the difference in detection time of source and sink. However there is a short detection range problem because the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR is not strong enough to be detected. So we analyze reflection process using MEMS CCR and base station, and simulate using analysis of reflected power of ray. And we suggest MEMS CCR array instead of single MEMS CCR to overcome weak power problem and analyze the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR array.

However, there is no effective solution to correlate all weaknesses, network topology with connectivity, and intrusion alerts. As a result, it can be difficult for network administrators to determine the root cause of a security incident. In this paper, we propose “GReat Evil ENcroachments Eradicator (GREENER)”, which can analyze the above network information in-depth and establish an intrusion path graph to display comprehensive information of security breaches. With the help of GREENER, system administrators can discover detailed information about an incident and rapidly remove network intrusion issues associated with the hardening process to prevent the same type of intrusion from happening again. This study has demonstrated that GREENER meets the requirements for mitigating security threats and provides a practical security incident response solution.","","978-1-4244-7007-5","978-1-4244-7009-9","10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664848","","Fires;Green products;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Operating systems","graph theory;security of data","hardening process;intrusion path graph;network architecture;network intrusion issues;network service;security incident;security risk;system administrator","","0","","12","","","26-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694","","Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security","Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers)","DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism","","0","","19","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is intended to identify potential attackers who try to modify or compromise the applications sent to execution by various users or target different resource groups within the Grid. The system makes use of a number of available local intrusion detection systems which send data to a grid-level intrusion detection system that takes decisions based on an overview of the entire Grid. This IDS can correlate the information received from the local systems, as well as monitoring data from the Grid System, using statistical methods, to identify attacks that cannot be detected at a local level. Another contribution of this paper is the classification of threats based on the intent of the attacker. This paper also demonstrates that these types of attacks can be detected using the proposed complex intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4244-5917-9","","10.1109/CISIS.2010.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447460","grid systems;idxp;intrusion detection;security","Application software;Authentication;Automatic control;Communication system security;Competitive intelligence;Grid computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software systems;Statistical analysis","grid computing;security of data","grid environment;grid systems;grid-level intrusion detection system;intrusion detection information;statistical method","","0","","12","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An Efficient Task Allocation Protocol for P2P Multi-agent Systems","Dayong Ye; Quan Bai; Minjie Zhang; Khin Than Win; Zhiqi Shen","Sch. of Comput.

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966","","Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness","multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment","","2","","16","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This requires the network management suit to monitor/analyze the aircraft-related data (avionics data, physical security parameters, etc.) while determining the proper functioning of the overall system. Herein, these authors present a framework for network management suit that, along with network health, monitors inputs from avionics, video surveillance system, weather monitoring system, and manual pilot alarms, and based on the situation, reconfigures the on-board networking devices to stream appropriate flight-critical data to the ground station.
