It has already become the most important problem faced by network workers how a large network can run normally, safely, efficiently and smoothly. On this basis, people began to develop the technology of intrusion detection, which is essentially different from security technologies existed in the past. It is a proactive detection instead of the passive ones of network security technology, and it is a reasonable complement for traditional security technologies.

Conventional GNP-based rule mining focused on binary-valued transaction data. Therefore, Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data. In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data. Then, a post-processing method is used to prune class association rules. After that, a classifier is modeled based on the multi-dimensional probability distribution for testing data.

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods. In addition, the automatic assignment of beliefs makes the use of such a system easier to deploy while providing a similar performance to that of a manual system.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687157","","","computer network security;inference mechanisms;probability;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;wireless LAN","802.11 attacks;D-S belief theory;Dempster-Shafer belief theory;automatic assigned thresholds;basic probability assignment;custom tailoring BPA;manual assigned thresholds;multilayer data fusion intrusion detection system;multimetrics;self-adaptive process;wireless attacks;wireless networks","","1","","","","","Jan. 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, we propose an external integrity checking system to enhance the OS security. The external integrity checking system and a target OS run on a hyper visor simultaneously, therefore, their operations do not affect each other.

The features of MANETs are like open media, dynamic changes in topology, cooperative and collaborative algorithm and no centralized monitoring system. These features make the network more prone to malicious attack. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we present a new cluster based intrusion detection algorithm that takes care of black hole attacks in a MANET. This proposed algorithm is based on trustworthiness of the nodes in a network. The network is considered to be a layered structured. The nodes are member of a cluster. Each cluster has cluster head that takes care of all the members of its own cluster and communicates with cluster head at layer 2 whenever required. The cluster head at layer 2 communicate with all cluster head at layer 1. The selection of cluster head depends on three parameters battery power, mobility and trust value of a node in a cluster. Periodically the cluster head updation is done according to three parameters. We have implemented our algorithm using the NS simulator. The performance of the proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has also been evaluated in the process. The performance graph shows marked improvement as far as packet dropping is concerned.","","978-1-4799-2274-1","","10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726110","Black hole;Cluster;Layered Architecture;MANET","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;firewalls;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET features;MCBHIDS;centralized monitoring system;collaborative algorithm;encryption software;firewall software;intrusion detection algorithm;intrusion detection system;malicious attack;mobile ad hoc networks;modified layered cluster based algorithm for black hole IDS;open media;packet dropping","","0","","21","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, the term `bad character' is a character that causes a mismatch. While checking multiple bytes in scanning the text at a time, the BLAST algorithm overcomes the reduction of the average shift value in a typical search, which is caused by the dependency on the multi-byte search unit (MBSU) and the large frequency of the last character of the given patterns. From the theoretical analysis, the authors validate the correctness of the BLAST algorithm. Also, from the experimental results across different setups, the authors show that the BLAST algorithm provides the faster search time than the other algorithms. For example, the authors obtain an enhancement by as much as 212.41% on average for various numbers of attack patterns and attack traffic conditions compared with that of the modified Wu-Manber algorithm. In addition, it is shown that the BLAST algorithm drastically reduces the amount of memory required for constructing the shift table based on a MBSU from 64 KB to 1 KB.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2011.0305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587875","","","computer network security;search problems;string matching;text analysis","B-layered bad-character SHIFT tables;BLAST algorithm;MBSU;Wu-Manber algorithm;attack patterns;attack traffic conditions;byte checking;high-speed pattern matching;multibyte search unit;multipattern matching algorithm;pattern search time;shift values;single bad-character SHIFT table;single-byte search unit;space-time tradeoff;text scanning","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

A Bayesian Network (BN) is known as graphical modeling tool used to model decision problems containing uncertainty. In this paper, a BN is used to build automatic intrusion detection system based on signature recognition. A major difficulty of this system is that the uncertainty on parameters can have two origins. The first source of uncertainty comes from the uncertain character of information due to a natural variability resulting from stochastic phenomena. The second source of uncertainty is related to the imprecise and incomplete character of information due to a lack of knowledge. The goal of this work is to propose a method to propagate both the stochastic and the epistemic uncertainties, coming respectively from the uncertain and imprecise character of information, through the Bayesian model, in an intrusion detection context.","","978-1-4244-4171-6","978-1-4244-4173-0","10.1109/ISI.2009.5137285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137285","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Context modeling;Intrusion detection;Marine vehicles;Protection;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Tellurium;Uncertainty","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;stochastic processes","Bayesian network;epistemic uncertainty;graphical modeling tool;hybrid propagation;intrusion detection;learning;model decision problem;signature recognition;stochastic phenomena","","0","","15","","","8-11 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various security mechanisms in the form of signature base models, anomaly detection, scanner, firewall and intrusion detection has been proposed but ineffective to provide complete security solution at application level. These provide partial solutions are ineffective to provide defense against zero day attacks with low false positive rate. We have introduced a novel approach for effective defenses against the application level attacks. Our system use the Bayesian filter to mitigate the context base attacks which are easily eludes packet level inspection. Our intelligent system is ontology base which analyze the input semantically and capable to detect zero day attacks with negligible false positive rates. The ontology base system can be refined and extended over time. Ontology base system also help in focusing on specific portion of network packet where attack is possible, thus reduce the research space and avoid sequential search.","","978-1-4244-3313-1","978-1-4244-3314-8","10.1109/IC4.2009.4909223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4909223","","Bayesian methods;Computer hacking;Data security;Filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;National security;Ontologies;Protection;Web server","belief networks;electronic commerce;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","Bayesian filter;Web application security;anomaly detection;e-business;firewall;information sharing;intrusion detection system;ontology based application","","6","","24","","","17-18 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application. Our results indicate that trust-based service composition significantly outperforms non-trust-based (random) service composition and its performance approaches the maximum achievable performance with global knowledge.","","978-1-4673-1238-7","978-1-4673-1237-0","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263792","Internet of things;Trust management;performance analysis;social networks","Accuracy;Communities;Convergence;Internet;Protocols;Quality of service;Security","Internet;computer network reliability;computer network security;protocols;trusted computing","Internet of Things;IoT;community-interest;cooperativeness;direct observations;false recommendation attacks;global knowledge;heterogeneous network environments;honesty;human-carried devices;human-operated devices;indirect recommendations;malicious nodes;maximum achievable performance;reliability management;scalable trust management protocol;smart objects;social encounter event;social interaction event;social relationships;trust aggregation;trust assessment accuracy;trust convergence time;trust evaluation;trust parameters;trust properties;trust-based service composition application","","1","","20","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The surging demand for higher bandwidth DPI systems capable of supporting larger rule-sets requires the use of hardware acceleration and hardware-based systems. In comparison to software based systems, the design and development of custom purpose hardware for DPI is expensive. The need for DPI solutions for a range of applications at high speed requires a unified processing platform. This paper presents the research in converting known DPI rule-sets into a meta format based on regular expressions, that can be executed by software and hardware-based processing platforms.

A number of the major techniques for network security protection, such as virtual private networks (VPN), firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), are all dependent on the speed and ability of packet classification. The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion. By adding a new regional code, which is used to encode the ranges spanning two regions or more, the improved mechanism is able to express all the ranges by only one entry. Simulation and characteristics analysis of real rule-sets verify this encoding mechanism's feasibility and efficiency in actual applications.","","978-0-7695-3932-4","978-1-4244-5467-9","10.1109/FCST.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392861","TCAM;entry expansion;packet classification;range matching","Computer science;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;National security;Protection;Quality of service;Routing;Virtual private networks;Wide area networks","computer network security;content-addressable storage;encoding;pattern matching","TCAM;encoding mechanism;entries expansion;network security protection;packet classification;range matching;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","14","","","17-19 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces a Network Intrusion Prevention System based on Ontological and Slow Intelligence approach. By the use of Ontology the proposed Network Intrusion Prevention System will analyze the input semantically while will improve over the time sharing knowledge among other similar systems or experts according to the Slow Intelligence approach. A first prototype of the environment has been developed and first experimental results have been showed.","","978-1-4673-1328-5","","10.1109/IMIS.2012.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296844","Intrusion Detection System;Network Security;Ontology;Slow Intelligence Approach","Correlation;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Security;Semantics;Servers","computer network security;information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","computer network security;enterprise information system;intrusion detection system improvement;network intrusion prevention system improvement;ontological approach;slow intelligent approach;time sharing knowledge improvement","","1","","","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In proposed approach, we initially classify the documents using Naïve Bayes. We find the context of an abstract by looking for associated terms which help us understand the focus of the abstract and interpret the information beyond simple keywords. The results indicate that context based classification increases accuracy of classification to great extent and in turn discovers different contexts of the documents.

To support this, routers in next generation computer networks use general purpose programmable packet processors. The customization of routers introduces increased vulnerabilities and attacks that allow potential attackers to compromise the router. Since network routers play a key role in todays network data transport, they became an interesting targets for attackers. An attacker can mount different attacks like denial-of-service or man-in-the-middle by intelligently dropping, modifying or diverting packets arriving at a compromised router. In this paper, we considered the problem of detecting packet modification attack which is performed by an attacker through misbehaving router. Since it is necessary to differentiate malicious packet modification from regular packet modification, detecting such an attack is challenging task. We proposed a controller-based packet modification misbehavior detection technique that excellently detects malicious packet modification by using a hash-based comparison of incoming and outgoing packets of the router. Experiments were carried out using Mininet Simulator and based on the results obtained, we observe that our proposed technique unambiguously detects the malicious packet modification.","","978-1-4799-3485-0","","10.1109/CNSC.2014.6906649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906649","","IP networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Software;Switches","Internet;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols","Internet supports;Mininet simulator;computer networks;controller-based packet modification misbehavior detection technique;denial of service attacks;diverting packets;dropping packets;hash-based comparison;heterogeneous applications;malicious packet modification;man-in-the-middle;misbehaving router;modifying packets;network data transport;network routers;packet modification attack detection;programmable packet processors;protocols applications;regular packet modification","","0","","11","","","19-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The property of “full-healing” is not only focused on registered-session recovery as most self-healing or mutual-healing group key distribution schemes, it enables an authorized group member to recover entire key chain for the historical sessions. We give a formal definition of the “full-healing” and introduce technical details and properties of the F-GKD schemes. Moreover, we propose a basic F-GKD scheme by using a one-way hash function and Shamir's secret sharing. Analysis proves that the proposed scheme has the following advantages: it is efficient in key recovery without additional transmissions from group manager or other neighboring members; it is collusion-resistant and information theoretically secure; it is communication efficient and flexible to member addition/revocation; it guarantees forward secrecy due to the one-way hash operations.","","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911852","full-healing;group communication;key distribution;one-way hash;secret sharing","Authentication;Computer integrated manufacturing;Cryptography;Educational institutions;Polynomials;Registers","private key cryptography;telecommunication security","CIMS;Chat;F-GKD;MMOG;Shamir secret sharing;forward secrecy;full-healing property;group key distribution;historical session keys;historical session recovery;instant messaging systems;massively multiplayer online games;new-added members;one-way hash operations","","0","","19","","","4-7 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system, intended mainly for Internet censorship, is a national-scale filter based on intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies. Our results indicate that the Chinese censors discontinued this HTML response filtering for the majority of routes some time between August 2008 and January 2009 (other forms of censorship, including backbone-level GET request filtering, are still in place). In this paper, we give evidence to show that the distributed nature of this filtering system and the problems inherent to distributed filtering are likely among the reasons it was discontinued, in addition to potential traffic load problems. When the censor successfully detected a keyword in our measurements and attempted to reset the connection, their attempt to reset the connection was successful less than 51% of the time, due to late or out-of-sequence resets. In addition to shedding light on why HTML response filtering may have been discontinued by the censors, we document potential sources of uncertainty, which are due to routing and protocol dynamics, that could affect measurements of any form of censorship in any country. Between a single client IP address in China and several contiguous server IP addresses outside China, measurement results can be radically different. This is probably due to either traffic engineering or one node from a bank of IDS systems being chosen based on source IP address. Our data provides a unique opportunity to study a national-scale, distributed filtering system.","1063-6927","978-1-4244-7261-1","","10.1109/ICDCS.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541676","","Computer science;Distributed computing;HTML;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Postal services;Telecommunication traffic","","","","0","","35","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism.

Its high computational demands have been pushing networking researchers to study how to improve DPI technologies. However, in this quest for better performance, little effort has been devoted to making fair performance comparisons among DPIs. Even worse, most studies show performance gains by applying DPI techniques using specific, and sometimes small, signature sets. Consequently, one DPI engine may report a certain maximum throughput while another one may report a similar performance but may have used a significantly smaller signature set. This fact makes it clear that the research community needs a well-defined framework for testing new DPI systems. This paper proposes a new framework for characterizing signature sets for evaluating DPI systems and provides an in-depth analysis of signature sets from application, protocol, and intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4673-0039-1","978-1-4673-0038-4","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162539","Characterization of Signature Sets;Computer Networks;Deep Packet Inspection;Performance Evaluation","Complexity theory;Distance measurement;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Spyware;Testing","computer network management;computer network security;digital signatures;inspection;protocols;telecommunication traffic","DPI system testing;deep packet inspection;intrusion detection systems;network management;protocol;signature sets;traffic profiling","","5","","18","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore the Software Defined Networking (SDN) instantiation OpenFlow has been designed according to these properties. The efforts are expected to result in lower expenditure and operational costs. To reach these objectives, mechanisms of classical networks that provide established functionalities have to be revalued and either transformed or redesigned from scratch to take advantage from SDNs. In this paper we describe our vision on flow sampling suitable for traffic monitoring in those networks. Without the loss of generality our approach was specifically created to monitor the quality of service for flows. We describe monitoring as one of possibly many applications that communicate with the SDN controller via the SDN Northbound API. We implemented a prototype SDN application called MonSamp and performed tests to demonstrate the feasibility of our concept.","","","","10.15439/2014F175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933120","Flow Sampling;Northbound API;QoS Monitoring;SDN;SDN Application","Control systems;Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Prototypes;Quality of service","application program interfaces;computer networks;distributed algorithms;quality of service;software engineering;telecommunication traffic","MonSamp;OpenFlow SDN instantiation;OpenFlow software defined networking instantiation;QoS monitoring;SDN northbound API;distributed SDN application;flow sampling;network traffic monitoring;quality of service monitoring","","0","","39","","","7-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of multiuser selection scheme is evaluated in two cases: in the absence of interference and in the presence of multiuser interference (MUI). In the former case, the closed-form capacity outage probability as well as the numerical values of the bit error rate (BER) are obtained via the probability density function (PDF) of signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classic indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channel. In the latter case, the multiuser interference cancellation coefficient as a random variable is added for the calculation of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). In addition, due to free space path loss and log-normal shadowing, the sum of MUI is treated as another log-normal-distributed random variable by exploiting central limit theorem. Numerical results show that the performance of multiuser selection scheme in HANs of smart grid is due to several factors, i.e., total number of devices in HANs, traffic intensity, modulation scheme, and multiuser interference cancellation coefficient, etc.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457436","Bit error rate (BER);home area networks (HANs);multiuser interference (MUI);multiuser selection;outage probability;smart grid","Bit error rate;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Interference;Modulation;Random variables;Signal to noise ratio;Smart grids","error statistics;home networks;interference suppression;log normal distribution;multiuser channels;probability;radio receivers;radiofrequency interference;radiotelemetry;smart meters;smart power grids","BER;HAN;MUI;PDF;S-V model;SINR;SNR;amplitude distribution property;bit error rate;classic indoor Saleh-Valen- zuela channel;closed-form capacity outage probability;dynamic home area networks;fading effects;free space path loss;log-normal shadowing;modulation scheme;multiuser interference cancellation coefficient;multiuser selection scheme;probability density func- tion;signal to noise ratio;smart grid communications;smart meter;traffic intensity","","1","","23","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The problem with intrusion detection systems (IDSes) is that they often produce thousands of alerts daily that must be dealt with by administrators manually. To provide situational awareness, detection systems usually employ (alert, priority) mappings that are either built in the IDS without consideration of the high-level mission objectives of the infrastructure, or manually defined by administrators through a time-consuming task that requires deep system-level expertise. In this paper, we present Seclius, an online security evaluation framework that translates low-level IDS alerts into a high-level system security measure and provides a ranking of past malicious events and affected system assets based on how crucial they are for the organization. Seclius significantly reduces human involvement by automatically learning system characteristics, providing a simple formalism that administrators can use to define security requirements. Experiments on a process control network with real vulnerabilities and a multistep attack show that Seclius can accurately report system security with low performance overhead and support the time-constrained security decision-making process that is necessary for critical infrastructure.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547151","Intrusion detection systems;information flow-based analysis;system security metric","Databases;Measurement;Organizations;Probabilistic logic;Security;Web servers","security of data","IDS;IT systems;Seclius framework;critical infrastructure;high-level system security measure;information flow-based consequence-centric security metric;information systems;intrusion detection system;online security evaluation framework;time-constrained security decision-making process","","1","","","","2013-06-25","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this game formulation, a defender is able to update its belief upon the maliciousness of the attacker. The feasible Nash equilibrium of the game is reviewed and an analytical framework for the rational attacker and defender is provided for a given set of resources with different security values under some constraints on the attack and monitor resources.

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

Using the pattern dividing, the variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.

"Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think","Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.","","Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE","20141120","2014","","","185","190","A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques. Moreover, it offers a taxonomy of the current literature by focusing on distributed cyber scanning detection methods.

In MANET, routing attacks try to disrupt the routing protocol functions by intentionally or unintentionally dropping packets or by propagating faked routing messages. However, due to their computation requirements and inefficiency against internal attacks, the prevention only mechanisms are not powerful enough to secure MANET routing protocols. In this paper, we present a distributed and cooperative scheme for MANETs routing attacks detection. The scheme collects and analyzes data that are sensitive to routing attacks so as to detect anomalous events. In this scheme, both direct observations and indirect observations are used so as to characterize the behaviors of both neighboring and remote nodes. The scheme utilizes the Grubb's test to develop new methods for detecting routing attacks and evaluating the exchanged information.","","978-1-4673-5697-8","","10.1109/WOCC.2013.6676457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676457","MANET;anomaly;intrusion detection;misbehaved node;routing attacks;routing protocol;statistical methods","","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","MANET routing protocol security;central management;data analysis;dropping packets;faked routing messages;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;reaction scheme;routing attacks detection;routing protocol functions;statistical methods","","0","","11","","","16-18 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not penetrate hosts protected by ASA.","1751-8628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2011.0566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219366","","","IP networks;access protocols;cache storage;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ARP cache management;ARP protocols;UDP packets;Windows XP;address resolution protocol;agent software;antiARP spoofing agent;data link layer address;denial of service attacks;kernel ARP software;network layer address;user datagram protocol packets","","1","","","","","May 1 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences.

The proposed framework offers flexibility for users to adjust the simulation parameters according to their needs. We then compare three existing trust models in this domain to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework when used in analyzing their efficiency, robustness and scalability.","","978-2-9532-4431-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5161654","","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computational modeling;Computer science;Computer simulation;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Robustness;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;stability","attack model;collaborative intrusion detection;deception model;efficiency;evaluation metrics;expertise model;intrusion detection systems;robustness;scalability;trust models","","1","","11","","","24-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even for a single time instant, it is a complex task to methodologically determine the infrastructure over which these services are provided and the corresponding effect on user perceived performance. For such tasks, researchers typically rely on active measurements or large numbers of volunteer users. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which we refer to as passive crowd-based monitoring. More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity. Passive crowd-based monitoring has the advantages that it does not add any overhead on Web infrastructure, it does not require any specific software on the clients, but still captures the performance and infrastructure observed by actual Web usage.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363979","","Gold;Google;Monitoring;Quality of service;Servers;Throughput;YouTube","Internet;quality of service","QoS;Web content providers;World Wide Web infrastructure;active measurements;passive crowd-based monitoring;passive measurements;proxy logs;quality of service","","0","","24","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although some similar proposals can be found in the specialized literature, two main differences exist with ours. First, mobility aspects are explicitly considered into the approach by means of a heuristic which considers the operation of the forwarding process at the nodes. Second, this fact results in a significant improvement in the detection performance of the system, especially in terms of low false positive rate. The different experimental results obtained show the promising nature of our approach, both in terms of the detection capabilities exhibited and from the point of view of the simplicity of the scheme.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295980","false positive;malicious behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility;packet dropping","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Proposals;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;cross-layer approach;malicious packet dropping detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility aspects","","2","","13","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present new architecture for multi-core supported Intrusion Detection System, which aims at providing network security processing without causing performance penalty to normal network operations. While hardware-based parallelisms have shown their advantage on throughput performance, parallelisms based multi-core provides more flexible, high performance, comprehensive, intelligent, and scalable solutions to network security applications.

This has necessitated the need for visual analysis within an intrusion detection system to identify these attacks. The challenges are how to increase the accuracy of detection and how to visualize and present flood attacks in networks for early detection. In this paper, we introduce three coefficients, which not only classify the behaviors of flood attacks, but also measure the system performance under those flood attacks: a) attack-density that patterns the characters of flood attack, b) system workload which represents the system capability in handling flood attack and c) the scalability to classify the impact level of the flood attack at victim site. A visual clustered method is used to display the DDoS flood attacks. The experimentation results are presented to demonstrate our new model significantly improves the accuracy of the detection of DDoS attacks and provides a better understanding of the nature of flood attacks on networks.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680852","DDoS flood attack;Network security;attack density;attack scale;information visualization;workload","Analytical models;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic;Visualization","Internet;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering","DDoS attack;Internet;attack-density;distributed denial-of-service attack;flood attack behavior classification;intrusion detection;system workload;visual analytics model;visual clustered method","","3","","36","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
