The classical and challenging task in intrusion detection is how to identify and classify new attacks or variants of normal traffic. Though the classification rate is not at par with supervised approach, unsupervised approach is not affected by the unknown attacks. Inspired by the success of bagging technique used in prediction, the study deployed similar re-sampling strategy by splitting the training data into half. Data was obtained from KDDCup 1999 dataset.

Examples include buffer overflow attacks, flooding attacks, system break-ins, etc. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a key role in detecting such malicious activities and enable administrators in securing network systems. Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses. Various design choices that were made to make this system practical and difficulties faced in integrating with existing models are also described. We show that this system achieves good performance empirically.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151345","","Computational modeling;Data models;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Servers;Testing;Training","computer network security;hidden Markov models;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","HMM based traffic model;adaptive network intrusion detection system;buffer overflow attacks;flooding attacks;hybrid approach;malicious activities;network system security;potential attack IP addresses;probabilistic classifier;system break-ins;unauthorized access","","2","","13","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the threat (intrusion) is detected, the workflow system needs to be stopped immediately to avoid any possible loss of enterprise data. The system becomes active again, once it is completely recovered from the threat. This proposed framework overcomes the problem of discontinuity of services as a result of threat detection by enabling the execution of the workflow on an alternate path, keeping the security and integrity of the asset information intact. Hence the system remains available all the time in a secured fashion making it possible for the end user to access the services and data even in the vulnerable state. To achieve the specified goals, the special authentication mechanism has been adopted to authorize the users after threat is detected. Then the data is hibernated that is transferred to the designed dimensions and the connectivity and access to the hibernated data is provided by the chameleon agent. These three core components enable the workflow to execute in a secured and robust manner during system's unsafe state.","","978-1-4244-5726-7","978-1-4244-5727-4","10.1109/ICCSN.2010.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437598","Chameleon;Hibernation;IDS (Intrusion Detection System);WFMS (Workflow Management Systems)","Authentication;Availability;Communication system software;Computer networks;Customer satisfaction;Data privacy;Data security;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Workflow management software","security of data;workflow management software","asset information;authentication mechanism;chameleon agent;enterprise data loss;hibernated data;service discontinuity problem;threat detection;workflow management systems;workflows alternate execution","","5","","24","","","26-28 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While obtaining high performance, it remains extremely flexible, with packet processing tasks implemented as simple modular elements that are composed to build fully functional routers and switches. Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion. We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier. In this configuration, Snap is able to forward 40 million packets per second, saturating four 10 Gbps NICs at packet sizes as small as 128 byes. This represents an increase in throughput of nearly 4x over the baseline Click running comparable elements on the CPU.","","978-1-4799-1640-5","","10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665173","","Graphics processing units;IP networks;Kernel;Parallel processing;Pipelines;Ports (Computers);Throughput","","","","4","","28","","","21-22 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion. We show through experiments that our scheme can provide a higher detection accurate rate and a lower false alarm rate than the existing detection scheme.

We propose a novel score-based multi-cyclic detection algorithm. The algorithm is based on the so-called Shiryaev-Roberts procedure. This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes. This is confirmed experimentally for real traces. We also discuss the possibility of complementing our anomaly detection algorithm with a spectral-signature intrusion detection system with false alarm filtering and true attack confirmation capability, so as to obtain a synergistic system.","1932-4553","","","10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2233713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6380529","CUSUM;Changepoint detection;Shiryaev–Roberts Procedure;TCP SYN attacks;cybersecurity;distributed denial-of-service attacks;intrusion detection;network traffic","Computer networks;Computer security;Delay;Detection algorithms;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Tin","computer network security","Shiryaev-Roberts procedure;alarm filtering;attack confirmation capability;changepoint detection method;computer network anomaly detection;computer network traffic;cumulative sum chart;exponentially-weighted moving average scheme;likelihood ratio;multicyclic setting;online anomaly detection;score-based multicyclic detection algorithm;sequential changepoint detection;spectral-signature intrusion detection system;synergistic system","","3","","27","","2012-12-12","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a method to optimize the potential memory usage of DFA based algorithms for multi-pattern expression matching by the combining DFA's paths, named isomorphic path combination (IMPC). To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA. It means that CDFA may be a more proper model for multi-pattern matching than other FAs.","1095-2055","978-1-4577-0637-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005927","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Pattern matching;Registers","optimisation;pattern matching;telecommunication security","CDFA;DFA based algorithms;Snort pattern set;high speed network;isomorphic path combination;memory usage;multipattern expression matching;network security;optimization;packet inspection;pattern sets","","0","","21","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20100112","2009","","","1","10","The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification. The results affirm the FPGA as a natural packet processing technology that can be programmed in a high-level manner appropriate to a packe- t-oriented mindset.","","978-1-4244-4375-8","978-1-4244-4377-2","10.1109/FPT.2009.5377604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377604","","Best practices;Concurrent computing;Data communication;Digital communication;IP networks;Network-on-a-chip;Programming profession;Scalability;Technological innovation;Testing","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based packet processing components;Internet;data communication;digital revolution;field programmable technology;high-level packet-centric language;high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities;natural packet processing technology;packet-oriented mindset;software engineering","","4","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We therefore propose a non-intrusive approach capable of verifying a user having performed a few times of file-related operations via a mouse. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the mouse movement of the file-related operations in Explorer, which is the most common way to search, open, save, copy, and/or delete files in Windows environments, is used for authentication.

In the existing literature, the analysis of the cyber security impacts has been primarily focused from the computer science perspectives investigating potential attacking scenarios and counter-measures through network security strategies. In this paper, we investigate traffic impacts of cyber attacks considering real-world driver behavior, especially the “built-in” safety redundancy of the visual verification by drivers or autonomous driving system. More specifically, we study the impact of “false-accident” attacks on the stability of traffic flow. In the false-accident attack, a vehicle sends out a false accident alert to its surrounding vehicle through CV-enabled network and has considered an attacking scenario that has catastrophic effects. Traffic flow stability is based on widely-used numerical linear stability analysis methods, the ring road test. In such a test, vehicles are restricted within a ring road so that traffic congestion and perturbations appear in cyclic patterns indicating the stability of traffic flow. The study indicates that false-accident attacks do not necessarily yield significant impact on the stability of traffic flow. Sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the attacking duration, the attacking vehicle position in a platoon, and the CV safety application reaction range.","","","","10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6799866","Car-Following Dynamics;Connected Vehicle Technologies;Cyber Security;Traffic flow stability","Acceleration;Accidents;Numerical stability;Roads;Safety;Stability analysis;Vehicles","numerical stability;sensitivity analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","CV safety application reaction range;CV systems;CV technologies;CV-enabled network;attacking scenario;attacking vehicle position;autonomous driving system;built-in safety redundancy;computer science perspectives;connected vehicle technologies;countermeasures;cyber security impacts;cyber security issues;cyclic patterns;false accident alert;false-accident attacks;network security strategies;numerical linear stability analysis methods;perturbations;real-world driver behavior;ring road test;sensitivity analysis;traffic congestion;traffic flow stability;vehicular network;visual verification","","1","","25","","","2-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are becoming ubiquitous and have been widely used to transfer critical information, such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails, and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An intelligent network forensics system that reconstructs intrusion scenarios and makes attack attributions requires knowledge about intrusions signatures, evidences, impacts, and objectives. In addition, problem solving knowledge that describes how the system can use domain knowledge to analyze malicious activities is essential for the design of intelligent network forensics systems. In this paper we adapt recent researches in semantic-web, information architecture, and ontology engineering to design a method ontology for network forensics analysis. The proposed ontology represents both network forensics domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge.

Due to the hysteresis and incompleteness of the signature establishment as well as the inaccuracy of statistics probability model, the effectiveness of traditional signature-based and statistics-based anomaly detection methods are directly restricted. Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series.

Computer network is a dynamic entity whose state changes with the introduction of new services, installation of new network operating system, and addition of new hardware components, creation of new user roles and by attacks from various actors instigated by aggressors. Various security mechanisms employed in the network does not give the complete picture of security of complete network. In this paper we have proposed taxonomy and ontology which may be used to infer impact of various events happening in the network on security status of the network. Vulnerability, Network and Attack are the main taxonomy classes in the ontology. Vulnerability class describes various types of vulnerabilities in the network which may in hardware components like storage devices, computing devices or networks devices. Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is required for network security situational awareness. Network class has network operating system, users, roles, hardware components and services as its subclasses. Based on this taxonomy ontology has been developed to perceive network security status. Finally a framework, which uses this ontology as knowledgebase has been proposed.","","978-1-4799-2290-1","","10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6799584","Network Security Status;Network Situational awareness;Ontology;Taxonomy","Automation;Computer networks;Hardware;Manuals;Ontologies;Security;Taxonomy","computer network security;network operating systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","computer network security;network operating system;ontology;taxonomy classes","","0","","21","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithms of the scheme take great advantage of the superiority of ECC (elliptic curves cryptosystem), such as high efficiency, short key length and etc. The scheme can achieve the same security with less storing space, smaller communication band-width and less overheads of the system and thus proves to be applicable to such circumstances as with restricted computation ability and integrated space, circumstances with limited bandwidth yet requiring for high-speed operation.","","978-0-7695-3859-4","","10.1109/IITA.2009.503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369403","bionic evolution;elliptic curves;private key optimization;proxy signature;system efficiency","Artificial intelligence;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Evolution (biology);Evolutionary computation;Forgery;Genetic mutations;Genetic programming;Machine learning algorithms;Security","artificial intelligence;digital signatures;evolutionary computation;public key cryptography","adaptive artificial intelligence technique;bionic evolution;coalition attack;elliptic curve cryptosystem;generalized signature forgery;optimizing selection algorithm;proxy signature scheme","","0","","19","","","21-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The special case are exit nodes that finally deliver traffic to it's intended destination, but that don't know from whom the traffic originates. All the TOR nodes are run by voluntaries throughout the Internet. It turns out that TOR network is heavily misused and thus it is dangerous to run TOR exit nodes as all the misuse of the network appears to be done from the exit nodes which could bring trouble to their owners. In this paper we analyse misuse of the TOR exit nodes and also propose mechanisms that could minimize, or even eliminate, misuse.

The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.","","978-1-4673-0161-9","978-1-4673-0162-6","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309308","agent;control;resilient system","Computer security;Control systems;Fault detection;Process control;Sensor phenomena and characterization","multi-agent systems","ReCoSEA;complex systems;coordination layer;cyber intrusion;data analysis;execution layer;faulty analysis;malignant actors;management layer;multiagent design;resilient control system execution agent","","5","","26","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a large data and it also consists of normal and abnormal pattern behavior. The analysis and detection of the abnormal pattern behavior in the network traffic data must spend a long time and very hard to find the intrusion pattern. However, the data mining technology can be utilized to extract normal and abnormal pattern behavior. In addition, an association rules technique is one kind of the data mining technology and it be widely utilized to find a pattern. It can discover the events that frequently occur in these data. In order to find the intrusion pattern, the network traffic data must be converted to the special format for the data mining process. In this paper, we propose the network traffic data to ARFF convertor for the association rules technique of the data mining. We developed the software by using Java language and Weka library. In order to evaluate the performance, we utilized the data set of the MIT-DAPRA 1999 in both week 4<sup>th</sup> and week 5<sup>th</sup>. Firstly, we wrote the Snort-IDS rules to detect the data set then record the alert data to mysql database. Secondly, the attributes of the header protocol from snort database will be selected such as tcp, icmp and udp protocol, then save the selected data as .csv file format. Thirdly, the .csv file will be converted to .arff file format by utilizing the Weka library. Finally, we used an apriori algorithm of the association rules mining technique to discover relation of itemsets in the data set. As the experimental result, our application can match the pattern that able to discover the frequent itemsets from the data set then it can generate the association rules which are helpful for computer and network administrator to analyze user behavior. In addition, the attribute of our application can be assigned the number of the attribute in the rule.

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores.

The main contribution of this study is the development of a common detection mechanism aiming at the centralized botnets. In this work we investigate the intrinsic characteristics based on the distributed yet bursting property of the centralized botnets. Our study shows that there exist great similarity and synchronization among the behaviors and the command and control (C&C) traffic of the bots, because the bots are controlled to operate according to the programmed schedule. Firstly we can determine if the groups of flows are suspectable by performing evaluation on the payload similarity and sequence correlation. Further, we will monitor and keep tracking with the collective and simultaneous behaviors of the suspicious groups of hosts.

However, clear design guidelines and techniques for the support of scalable IMS-based deployment, especially for data-intensive services such as mobility management, presence, and instant messaging, are still missing. That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels. The reported experimental results point out that our solution can significantly increase intradomain scalability with very limited costs.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6342884","Mobile computing;mobile applications;network management;support services","Load management;Mobile computing;Scalability","IP networks;information dissemination;mobility management (mobile radio);multimedia communication;resource allocation;telecommunication network routing","IMS-based services;IP multimedia subsystem;application providers;component deactivation;data-centric session state dissemination;data-intensive services;design guidelines;fast intradomain balancing;instant messaging;interoperable session control;intradomain deployment issues;intradomain scalability;long-term intradomain load partitioning;mobility management;network operators;next-generation all-IP networks;scalable IMS-based deployment;service-aware load monitoring;service-aware routing","","2","","34","","2012-11-10","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 μW output power to the IOT smart nodes. Measured results showed that the PV harvesting system achieved both ultra-low power operation capability at 12 μW and a peak self-sustaining efficiency of 86%.","0018-9200","","","10.1109/JSSC.2015.2418712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091040","Capacitor value modulation;Internet of things;MPPT;energy harvesting;photovoltaic;power management","Capacitors;Charge pumps;Energy harvesting;Hysteresis;Sensors;Switches;Time-domain analysis","Internet of Things;energy harvesting;hysteresis;maximum power point trackers;power consumption;power engineering computing;radio transmitters;solar cells;time-domain analysis","CVM scheme;IOT Smart Nodes;Internet Of Things network;PV cell;capacitor value modulation scheme;circuit level technique;hill-climbing MPPT mechanism;hysteresis controller;hysteresis regulation;power budget;power consumption;power hungry analog circuit;self-sustaining PV energy harvesting system;self-sustaining photovoltaic energy harvesting system;self-triggered one-shot mechanism;signal processor;time-domain MPPT;ultra-low power operation;wireless transmitter","","0","","29","","2015-04-21","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We have divided packet processing into two parts as header information processing and payload processing. In header information processing we select features from packet header and create model for normal behavior with histograms, then find out the deviation from created models and classify the network traffic. In payload processing we create models of normal payload by generating histograms of payload ASCII distribution and find deviation from created models and classify traffic. Our work differs from previous anomaly based detection techniques by creating histograms for both network header features and for payload of packet, so that our detection system identifies both flooding attacks and non flooding attacks efficiently.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972283","Anomaly Detection System;Attacks;histograms","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;anomaly detection system;computer networks;detection rates;flooding attacks;header information processing;nIDS;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;nonflood attacks;packet header analysis;payload ASCII distribution;payload histograms;security package","","1","","12","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the immense increase of the number of users of Facebook made it rise to become the largest existing social network with more than 1.2 billion active users. However, these numbers also rose the attention of hackers and attackers who aim at propagating malware and viruses for obtaining confidential information regarding social network users. In this manner, it is crucial that each Facebook user is able to easily access, control and analyse the information shared on the corresponding profile so that profile usage deviations can be more efficiently detected. However, despite the fact that Facebook allows an analysis of all user actions through the Timeline Review, this information is not comprehensively organized and there is no statistical analysis of the user generated data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework comprising a Facebook event collector, which by being provided with an authentication token for a user profile obtained through a Facebook application developed for this purpose, collects all the corresponding posted information and stores it in a relational database for a posteriori analysis. Through the graphical interface of the developed application, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user's behaviour. By storing each event with the corresponding timestamp, we are able to perform an efficient and comprehensive analysis of all posted contents and compute statistical models over the obtained data. In this manner, we can create a notion of normal usage profile and detect possible deviations which may be indicative of a compromised user account.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912474","Monitoring Framework;Profile Hijack;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Analytical models;Authentication;Computational modeling;Databases;Facebook;Monitoring","computer viruses;graphical user interfaces;information dissemination;relational databases;social networking (online);statistical analysis","Facebook event collector framework;Timeline Review;authentication token;content dissemination;graphical interface;information dissemination;malware;normal usage profile;posted content analysis;profile monitoring purposes;profile usage deviations;relational database;social networks;statistical models;viruses","","0","","15","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493","Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation","","digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures","NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering","","7","","36","","2010-06-17","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By controlling the redundancy level for multisource multipath and intrusion detection settings dynamically with energy considerations as prescribed by our algorithm, we demonstrate that the lifetime of a query-based autonomous WSN is maximized in response to changing environment conditions including node density, radio range, and node capture rate.","","978-1-4673-5069-3","","10.1109/ISADS.2013.6513409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513409","Wireless sensor networks;intrusion detection;multisource multipath routing;reliability;security;timeliness","Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Redundancy;Routing;Sensors;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","23","","","6-8 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

None of the existing wireless security protocols considers protection against them. We propose a novel scheme that detects and reduce DoS attacks in the WLANs. The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one. The scheme protects AS from DoS as hash calculations for detection of DoS are done once only. Scheme also prevents against legacy authentication/association and deauthentication/disassociation flooding DoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141379","802.11i;Denial of Service;WLAN Security;authentication","Authentication;Computer crime;Floods;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Microwave integrated circuits;Public key","access protocols;authorisation;client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;message passing;wireless LAN","DoS attack detection;DoS attack reduction;WLAN;access point;authentication server;client authentication requests;deauthentication;denial of service attacks;hash calculations;legacy association;legacy authentication;message forwarding;random number rate control mechanism;wireless LAN;wireless security protocols","","0","","29","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the recent push for a “Smart Grid” has shown promise for increased efficiency, security has often been an after-thought, leaving this critical infrastructure vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, devices crucial to the safe operation of the power grid are left in remote substations with their configuration interfaces completely open, providing a vector for outsiders as well as insiders to launch an attack. This paper develops the framework for an overlay network of gateway devices that provide authenticated access control and security monitoring for these vulnerable interfaces. We develop a working prototype of such a device and simulate the performance of deployment throughout a substation. Our results suggest that such a system can be deployed with negligible impact on normal operations, while providing important security mechanisms. By doing so, we demonstrate that our proposal is a practical and efficient solution for retro-fitting security onto crucial power system devices.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007774","","Maintenance engineering;Performance evaluation;Security;Smart grids;Substations;Universal Serial Bus","authorisation;message authentication;overlay networks;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;smart power grids;substations","authenticated access control;configuration interfaces;cyber attacks;gateway devices;insider threat mitigation;overlay network;physical overlay framework;power grid;power system devices;remote substations;retro-fitting security;security mechanisms;security monitoring;smart grid","","0","","22","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They perform a wide range of important network functions, including WAN optimizations, intrusion detection systems, network and application level firewalls, etc. Depending on the processing requirement of traffic, packet processing for different traffic flows may consume vastly different amounts of hardware resources (e.g., CPU and link bandwidth). Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice. We show, both analytically and experimentally, that our queueing scheme achieves nearly perfect Dominant Resource Fairness.","","","","10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733610","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Middleboxes;Radiation detectors;Round robin;Schedules;Time complexity","computational complexity;queueing theory;scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","WAN optimization;application level firewall;dominant resource fairness;elastic round robin;intrusion detection system;low complexity packet scheduler;multiple middlebox resources;multiresource fair queueing scheme;multiresource round robin;packet processing;time complexity;traffic flow","","2","","23","","","7-10 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, one of the most significant objectives in wireless communication networks is to improve the autonomy of the terminal devices. In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions. The proposed time scheduling strategies are based on the optimal stopping theory, considering two minimization approaches for the consumption of transmission energy.

We propose a hybrid IDS, which combines network and host IDS, with anomaly and misuse detection mode, utilizes auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and applies data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities.","","978-1-4244-6388-6","978-1-4244-6389-3","10.1109/ETCS.2010.478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459845","analysis engine;apriori algorithm;data mining;hybrid ids;intrusion detection","Computer hacking;Computer science;Content addressable storage;Data mining;Data security;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Engines;Intrusion detection;System testing","data mining;feature extraction;security of data;uncertainty handling","auditing programs;data mining;feature extract;host IDS;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;misuse detection mode;network connection;network-based intrusion detection techniques;security infrastructures;uncertainty characteristic","","4","","5","","","6-7 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the IoT, static security mechanisms are not well suited to handle all security risks sufficiently. A security mechanism can be considered static if it is developed with fixed security measures whereas an adaptive security mechanism can be considered dynamic if it can continuously monitor, analyse, and reassess a security risk at runtime. Adaptive security mechanisms can be a better choice to secure dynamic and heterogeneous computing systems in the IoT. This paper presents a patient monitoring scenario using the smart IoT and aims at highlighting all important assets, vulnerabilities, and threats that can harm assets and disrupt eHealth systems. We describe adaptive security and introduce a concept of adaptive security countermeasures for the smart IoT in eHealth.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266525","IoT;adaptive security;eHealth;threats","Adaptive systems;Hospitals;Malware;Monitoring;Sensors","Internet of Things;decision making;patient monitoring;telecommunication security","IoT;adaptive security countermeasures;adaptive security mechanisms;dynamic computing systems;eHealth;heterogeneous computing systems;patient monitoring;self decision making;smart Internet of Things;static security mechanisms;threats identification","","","","","","","27-29 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the information fusion module, the D-S evidence theory was used to fuse all the dynamic evidences. The weighted evidence was more effective on increasing the accuracy of the evaluation. In the calculation of weights of different variable the information entropy method was introduced to avoid subjectivity. An adaptive mechanism was also presented to adapt to dynamic host activities.

As the Internet volume is increasing rapidly, security against the real time attacks and their fast detection issues gain attention of many researchers. Data mining methods can be effectively applied to (IDS) to tackle the problems of dynamic huge network data and to improve IDS performance. We can reduce the time complexity by selecting only useful features to build model for classification. There are many features selection techniques are developed either to select the features or extract features. In this paper, an evolutionary approach for feature selection is proposed which is based on mathematical intersection principle. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a search method while selecting features from full NSL KDD data set along with the intersection principle of selecting those only who appears everywhere in the experiment. The results of proposed approach when compared using classifiers, it shows tremendous growth in accuracy of a Naïve Bayes classifier with reduced time and minimum number of features.","","978-1-4799-6804-6","","10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218109","Dimensionality reduction;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm (GA);IDS;Naive Bayes","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Correlation;Genetic algorithms;Sociology","Internet;computational complexity;computer network security;data mining;feature extraction;feature selection;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;search problems","IDS performance improvement;Internet volume;NSL KDD data set;Naïve Bayes classifier;data mining methods;effective intrusion detection system;evolutionary approach;fast detection issues;feature extraction;genetic algorithm based feature selection approach;intersection principle;malicious activity identification;mathematical intersection principle;real time attacks;search method;time complexity reduction","","0","","17","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) may act as defensive mechanisms, since they monitor network activities in order to detect malicious actions performed by intruders, and then initiate the appropriate countermeasures. IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. In this paper, we study the different architectures existing the IDS for MANETs. We briefly present for each architecture, after an analysis, the strengths and weaknesses, the methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performances and the provided security services. Then, we propose a new IDS architecture for MANET, this architecture is a combination of model hierarchical based on clusters and cooperation model based on a multi-agent system (SMA). In this architecture, agents use a knowledge base related to a global security ontology, it can be used to infer new detection rules.","","978-1-4799-4648-8","","10.1109/ICoCS.2014.7060919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060919","IDS architectures;Intrusion Detection System(IDS);MANETs security;Mobile ad hoc networks(MANETs);Multi-Agent System (SMA);Security attacks;Security vulnerabilities","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computer architecture;Engines;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing","mobile ad hoc networks;multi-agent systems;software architecture;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","IDS architecture;MANET;SMA;global security ontology;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base agents;malicious action detection;mobile ad hoc networks;multiagent systems;security services","","0","","26","","","10-12 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the standard used for session signaling in VoIP. Crafty attackers can launch a number of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on a SIP based VoIP infrastructure that can severely compromise its reliability. In contrast, little work is done to analyze the robustness and reliability of SIP severs under DoS attacks. In this paper, we show that the robustness and reliability of generic SIP servers is inadequate than commonly perceived. We have done our study using a customized analysis tool that has the ability to synthesize and launch different types of attacks. We have integrated the tool in a real SIP test bed environment to measure the performance of SIP servers. Our measurements show that a standard SIP server can be easily overloaded by sending simple call requests. We define the performance metrics to measure the effects of flooding attacks on real time services - VoIP in SIP environment - and show the results on different SIP server implementations. Our results also provide insight into resources' usage by SIP servers under flooding attacks. Moreover, we show that how a well known open source SIP server can be crashed through 'INVITE of Death' - a malformed SIP packet maliciously crafted by our tool.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5426247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5426247","","Computer crime;Floods;Internet telephony;Measurement;Protection;Protocols;Robustness;Storage area networks;Testing;Web server","Internet telephony;multimedia communication;signalling protocols;telecommunication network reliability","DoS attacks;INVITE of Death;SIP-based VoIP systems;Voice over Internet Protocol;denial of service;malformed SIP packet;multimedia communication;reliability;session initiation protocol","","7","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present our work which concentrates on multi-pattern signature and propose a FPGA-based deep packet inspection engine for NIDS. The system can support both static and dynamic patterns. We employ Snort signature set and realize our system on NetFPGA platform.
