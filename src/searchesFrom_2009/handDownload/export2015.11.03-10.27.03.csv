Many intrusion detection systems are developed to protect the network using signature-based matching technique. For connection oriented protocols, such as Transmission Control Protocol, the data should be reassembled before being scanned by the matching engine. Several techniques are introduced to reassemble TCP packets on FPGA. However, they have some disadvantages such as inefficient memory, unscalable system, and unsupported complex TCP connections. In this paper, we propose a multi-linked-list approach and a combination of edge buffering scheme for TCP reassembly, which helps detecting cross packets intrusion signatures. Our architecture not only supports TCP connections with up to 4 concurrent holes, but also uses memory more efficiently than others. The experimental results show that our system can hold about 256K connections simultaneously and support up to 46K out-of-sequence connections with only 64MB DRAM.","","978-1-4673-2026-9","","10.1109/ECTICon.2012.6254336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6254336","Edge;FPGA;Linked list;Segment array;TCP reassembly","Buffer storage;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Random access memory;Robustness;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;computer network security;digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;transport protocols","DRAM;FPGA;TCP connections;TCP packet reassembly;concurrent holes;connection oriented protocols;cross packet intrusion signature detection;edge buffering scheme;matching engine;memory usage;multilinked-list approach;out-of-sequence connections;signature-based matching technique;signature-based network intrusion detection system;transmission control protocol","","1","","12","","","16-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is accomplished by assigning IP address and port number to the Ethernet interface of the SAMSysMP9320 reader/writer. Therefore the Internet and LAN -based RFID are merged, and RFID tag without power supply can be read and written from afar by the Internet.

Because of the complexity and the number of different variables involved with information security, a special analytical tool is required to address the problem of how to balance the investment in different parts of the system in order to reduce the losses due to cyber attacks. Using the System Dynamics approach as an effective analytical tool is proposed to demonstrate dealing of complex situations due to cyber attacks involving different variables such as attractiveness of targets to losses, and their inter-relationships. Using this model, a casual loop diagram can be used to present an overview of the model and its associated variables. The model is based on quantitative measurements of security and the time that attackers may need to compromise a system.

The sharing of data for data mining can bring a lot of advantages for research and business collaboration. The misuse of these techniques may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. However, large repositories of data contain private data and sensitive rules that must be protected before published. Motivated by the multiple conflicting requirements of data sharing, privacy preserving and knowledge discovery, and privacy preserving data mining has become a research hotspot in data mining and database security fields. Researchers have recently made efforts at hiding sensitive association rules. This paper presents a novel based approach that strategically modifies a few transactions in the database. It modifies support or confidence values for hiding sensitive rules without producing many side effects. Nevertheless, undesired side effects such as nonsensitive rules falsely hidden and spurious rules falsely generated, may be produced in the rule hiding process.","","978-1-4673-0213-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215950","Association Rule;Association Rule mining;Data mining;Mining methods;Privacy Preservation;Rule hiding","Abstracts;Conferences;Data privacy;Databases;Medical diagnostic imaging","data analysis;data mining;data privacy;database management systems;transaction processing","association rule mining;business collaboration;data analysis;data privacy preserving;data repository;data sharing;database security fields;database transactions;knowledge discovery;nonsensitive rules;pattern based framework;privacy preservation;privacy preserving data mining;private data;rule hiding process;sensitive association rules;sensitive information","","0","","13","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can provide a node the confidence to interact with peer nodes. However this indirect trust is vulnerable to various types of attacks from dishonest recommenders. This paper proposes a scheme that removes the dishonest recommendations before utilizing the recommended trusts. Removing the dishonest recommendations will remove impact of dishonest recommendations on the indirect trust of a node. The mechanism is based on the dissimilarity function among the recommended trust for filtering out the dishonest recommendations. The recommendations that result in the highest dissimilarity are considered as malicious recommendations. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated against bad mouthing, ballot stuffing and random opinion attacks.

OpenFlow protocol is an embodiment of the software-defined networking paradigm. OpenFlow network security applications can implement more complex logic processing flows than their permission or prohibition. Such applications can implement logic to provide complex quarantine procedures, or redirect malicious network flows for their special treatment. Security detection and intrusion prevention algorithms can be implemented as OpenFlow security applications, however, their implementation is often more concise and effective. In this paper we considered the algorithm of the information security management system based on soft computing, and implemented a prototype of the intrusion detection system (IDS) for software-defined network, which consisting of statistic collection and processing module and decision-making module. These modules were implemented in the form of application for the Beacon controller in Java. Evaluation of the system was carried out on one of the main problems of network security - identification of hosts engaged in malicious network scanning. For evaluation of the modules work we used mininet environment, which provides rapid prototyping for OpenFlow network. The proposed algorithm combined with the decision making based on fuzzy rules has shown better results than the security algorithms used separately. In addition the number of code lines decreased by 20-30%, as well as the opportunity to easily integrate the various external modules and libraries, thus greatly simplifies the implementation of the algorithms and decision-making system.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778942","Fuzzy Logic;Information security;OpenFlow;Port scan;Software-Defined Networks","Decision making;Information security;Software algorithms;Switches;Training","decision making;fuzzy logic;protocols;security of data;software radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","Java;OpenFlow protocol;beacon controller;data flows routing;decision making;decision-making module;fuzzy logic-based information security management;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention algorithms;logic processing flows;malicious network flows;malicious network scanning;mininet environment;network infrastructure;network security;processing module;security detection;soft computing;software-defined networks;statistic collection","","2","","7","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","","978-1-4244-5175-3","978-1-4244-5176-0","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters. Simulation results then illustrate the performance of the algorithms.","","","","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6736855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736855","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;sequential hypothesis testing","Approximation methods;Error probability;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Testing;Uncertainty","computer network security;minimisation;probability;statistical testing","abnormal components;abnormal independent component;abnormal state;anomalous component;anomaly localization;asymptotically optimal low-complexity algorithms;component priorities;composite hypothesis;distribution parameter uncertainty;distribution parameters;error probability constraints;expected weighted completion time sum minimization;independent model;normal component;optimal index policies;overall network damage reduction;resource-constrained cyber network","","4","","24","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased.

The outcomes of the game are quantified by specifying players' preferences and by assigning numbers to reflect these preferences. Examining players' best responses, the solution of the game follows by locating all the Nash Equilibria (NE). We extend the NE notion to the logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), to capture players' bounded rationality.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.","","978-1-4244-8448-5","978-0-7695-4236-2","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852","ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence","Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation","computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems","biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion. We call our proposed DIDS model Consultative Trusted Computing-based Collaborative IDS (CTC IDS). We utilize the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for integrity evaluation and to fine-tune peer evaluation.","","978-1-4673-1425-1","","10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246102","Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems;Trust Management in Distributed Intrusion Detection","Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Software","distributed processing;groupware;security of data;trusted computing","CTC IDS;DIDS model consultative trusted computing-based collaborative IDS;TPM;collaborative network;distributed intrusion detection trust management;expertise evaluation;information collaboration;information sharing;integrity evaluation;peer evaluation fine tuning;trust aware DIDS simulation model;trusted platform module","","0","","19","","","26-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method yield fewer false positive alerts when compared to similar non-supervised methods in the literature.","","978-1-4673-6425-6","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632070","Intrusion detection;anomaly-based detection;clustering;security","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Training;Web servers","Internet;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-adjusting systems;statistical analysis;transport protocols","HTTP access patterns;clustering-based method;data clustering;heuristic method;intrusion detection systems;nonsupervised IDS;nonsupervised learning;protecting Web servers;self-organizing system;self-protecting system;web servers","","0","","19","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) are one of the most significant of such threats. Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0","978-0-7695-3760-3","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","3","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Now the research is going on On-Line Updates for local agents and global agents individually in high data rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), when the network has maximum mobility and maximum data rate.","","978-1-4673-0270-8","","10.1109/ICCCA.2012.6179178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179178","Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes;Intrusion Detection;Key management;Wireless Sensor Networks","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Noise measurement;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","error statistics;protocols;self-adjusting systems;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DYDOG;WSN;data flow;dynamic intrusion detection node;dynamic intrusion detection protocol model;global agent;high error rate wireless sensor network;intrusion monitoring node;local agent;maximum data rate;maximum mobility;network attack;one-hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;physical environment;secure session key management;self-organizing sensor node;two hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;wireless environment","","3","","11","","","22-24 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel method of user behavior analysis in semantic network. We use the weight value to analyze and record user behavior and then check user behavior record with the signatures which are generated by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). If a user record matches with signatures, the system will pass the record to the Analysis Console for Intrusion Database (ACID) to do more the further processing and then response to user. The ACID does not only help the system administrator to maintain and protect the web service in order to prevent the intruders' attacking but also show the security information. In the current Internet, it is a very complex and insecure environment. Everything can be happened in this environment. In our solution, it can not only successfully solve the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack and SQL Injection attack but also understand user behavior.

Sequencegram model short sequences of system calls in the form of n-grams and store in a tree (for the space efficiency) called as n-gram-tree. A score known as anomaly score is associated with every short sequence (based on its occurrence frequency) which represents the probability of short sequence being anomalous. As it is generally assumed that, there is a skewed distribution of normal and abnormal sequences, more frequently occurring sequences are given lower anomaly score and vice versa.

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reduction in video hardware cost has made it more feasible for large scale camera deployment. However, the increased scale of camera deployment creates difficulties for humans to track people through the monitored space and to recognize important events as they happen in timely manner without human intervention. In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC. Indeed, we have also managed to maintain the video analytics accuracy at 100% for given test dataset, in this implementation of the system.","","978-1-4799-2208-6","","10.1109/SPC.2013.6735111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735111","CUDA;GPGPU;parallelization;streaming;video analytics;video surveillance system","Accuracy;Cameras;Central Processing Unit;Conferences;Graphics processing units;Process control;Streaming media","graphics processing units;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;security of data;video cameras;video streaming;video surveillance","CUDA;GPGPU;camera surveillance area;compute unified device architecture;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion detection system;large scale camera deployment;macroparallelization;microparallelization;multinode video analytics processing;people tracking;real-time multinode streaming;surveillance activity;video hardware cost reduction;video surveillance system","","0","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing usages of WSN applications such as health care and disaster reporting, security requirements, wireless communication has become more critical. Researchers of intrusion detection system on WSN have suggested that systems' detecting mechanisms would likely affect their detections effective and lifetime of whole networks. Ontology can collect and organize the attributes of attacks However, those methods have empirically documented the link between ontology concept and light-weight Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is scant. Therefore, the aim of this paper attempts to explore how intrusion detection system about ontology and light-weight IDS are related. The manager constructs relationship of sensor nodes on ontology to detect Sybil attack. Combine light-weight IDS the ranger method to reduce energy consumption and the isolation tables avoid detecting anomaly repeatedly. We proposed a lightweight ontology-based IDS, which improves existence shortcomings of IDS on WSN effectively.","","978-1-4577-0817-6","978-0-7695-4449-6","10.1109/ICGEC.2011.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042715","Intrusion Detection System;Ontology;Sybil Attack;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Ontologies;Wireless sensor networks","ontologies (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sybil attack detection;WSN application;disaster reporting;health care;light-weight intrusion detection system;lightweight ontology-based IDS;security requirement;sensor node;wireless communication;wireless sensor network","","4","","10","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Societies depend on their critical infrastructure in order to maintain and continuously improve on their standards of living. As these systems increasingly depend on cyber-technology, their security on networked environments become crucial. The modern smart grid has become part of CI through the enhancement it provides to regular electricity grid infrastructure. The application of biologically inspired systems to ensure security in aspects such as intrusion detection, access control, anomaly detection and others has become a widely researched field in when dealing with networked computing systems. This paper discusses the importance of CI, the application of artificial immune systems in the protection of CI information systems and proposes a new model for smart grid protection using biologically inspired concepts.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296096","Critical infrastructure;SCADA;danger theory;immune algorithms;immunological computation","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Electricity;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Power grids","SCADA systems;artificial immune systems;critical infrastructures;multi-agent systems;power engineering computing;power system protection;security of data;smart power grids","CI information systems protection;artificial immune systems;biologically inspired concepts;biologically inspired systems;critical information infrastructure protection;cyber-technology;immunologically-inspired conceptual model;living standards;multiagent immunologically-inspired model;networked computing systems;networked environments security;regular electricity grid infrastructure;smart power grid security","","0","","22","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This results in a need to have a high-speed network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect malicious traffic. Snort is a software-based NIDS that can run as a single threaded application. However, it may not be able to detect intrusions in real-time especially in networks with high traffic. This paper proposes a two layer framework where Snort will run as a second line of defense and will be executed only when deep payload analysis is needed. To accelerate the efficiency of Snort, the proposed system will dynamically offload the most frequent rules or signatures to a NetFPGA based hardware. The NetFPGA will work as a first line of defense that accelerates the detection by filtering all the traffic looking for intrusions. This will be done by analyzing the captured packet header to match the offloaded rules or signatures.","","","","10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923858","Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Radiation detectors","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","NetFPGA based hardware;NetFPGA-based Snort NIDS;deep payload analysis;high-speed network intrusion detection system;malicious traffic detection;single threaded application;software-based NIDS","","0","","17","","","23-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Spoofing prevention using received signal strength for ZigBee-based home area networks","Jokar, P.; Arianpoo, N.; Leung, V.C.M.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm), 2013 IEEE International Conference on","20131219","2013","","","438","443","In this paper we present a novel spoofing prevention system (SPS) for ZigBee based home area networks (HANs) within smart grids. The proposed SPS uses the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) in order to detect attacks and filter malicious frames. The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead. The soundness of the proposed method is proved through both theoretical analysis, as well as experiments.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687997","","Computer security;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;computer network security","HAN;ZigBee based home area networks;attack prevention;dynamic threshold;malicious frames;novel spoofing prevention system;received signal strength;security center;smart grids;spoofing detection module;static threshold","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
