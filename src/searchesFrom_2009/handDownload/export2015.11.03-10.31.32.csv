Cyber-physical systems primarily transmute how we interact with the physical world, with each system requiring different levels of security based on the sensitivity of the control system and the information it carries. Considering the remarkable progress in CPS technologies during recent years, advancement in security and trust measures is much needed to counter the security violations and privacy leakage of integration elements.

In the eventual presence of a non-collaborating node, system evolution is corrected by the action of a monitoring node. Such fault counteraction is based on an autoregressive elaboration of local data only. A perfect compensation of the drift caused by the fault on the objective function is shown to be achievable using time varying gains; the set of such time-varying gains is computed and it is shown that it satisfies a suitable autoregressive equation. Further, we estimate the convergence region of the state vector when the proposed compensation technique is used in the presence of persistent unknown but bounded disturbances.

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. AODV, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980","978-1-4244-4214-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition service oriented architecture relies heavily on XML/RESTFul web services which are vulnerable to XML Signature Wrapping Attack, Oversize Payload, Coercive parsing, SOAP Action Spoofing, XML Injection, WSDL Scanning, Metadata Spoofing, Oversized Cryptography, BPEL State Deviation, Instantiation Flooding, Indirect Flooding, WS-Addressing spoofing and Middleware Hijacking to name a few. In this paper, we review various such security issues pertaining to service oriented architecture. These and similar techniques, have been employed by Anonymous and other hacktivists, resulting in denial of service attacks on financial applications.

This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time. The proposed framework is demonstrated to detect tampering activities using a realistic 12.47-kV distribution network.

Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples.

Our goal in this work is to improve the trustworthiness of a host and its system data. Specifically, we provide a new mechanism that ensures the correct origin or provenance of critical system information and prevents adversaries from utilizing host resources. We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM).

Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic. This traffic-monitoring framework helps identify network activities of stealthy malware, and lends itself to a powerful personal firewall for examining all outbound traffic of a host that cannot be bypassed.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035722","Authentication;cryptography;malware;networking.;provenance","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Malware;Network security;System-on-a-chip","cryptography;formal verification;invasive software;protocols;trusted computing","TPM;critical system information;cryptographic provenance verification;data-provenance verification;malicious software;malicious traffic detection;malware;protocol;secure hosts;system-data integrity;trusted computing platform","","5","","37","","2011-10-06","March-April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition to having privileged access to organization resources and information, these users may be familiar with the defenses surrounding valuable assets. Computers systems at the organization need a mechanism for communicating suspicious activity that is difficult for a malicious insider (or even an outsider) to detect or block. In this work, we propose a covert channel in the Ethernet frame that allows a computer system to report activity inside other, unrelated network communication. The covert channel leverages the differences in the framing approaches used by Ethernet and IP packets to append hidden information to IP packet and transmit it to an organization's administrator. This stealthy communication is difficult for even advanced attackers and is challenging to block since it opportunistically uses unrelated communication. Further, since the transmission is tied to the Ethernet frame, the communication cannot traverse network routers, preventing security information from leaving the organization. We introduce the covert channel, incorporate it into a working prototype, and combine it with an intrusion detection system to show its promise for security event reporting.","","978-1-4799-0458-7","","10.1109/SPW.2013.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565231","Covert Channels;Insider Threats;Network Security","IP networks;Monitoring;Operating systems;Organizations;Payloads;Protocols;Security","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication network routing","Ethernet frame;IP packets;computer system;covert channels;insider threats;intrusion detection system;network communication;network routers;organization resources;security event reporting;security information;stealthy communication;suspicious activity;trusted insiders","","0","","26","","","23-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their main drawback is that they are more exposed to cyber-attack as data packets have to be relayed on a hop-by-hop basis. This paper presents a dynamically updating key distribution strategy, together with a message protection scheme in support of 4-way handshaking. For the 4-way handshaking, we propose a hash based encryption scheme to secure the unprotected message exchanges during the handshaking process. This is aimed at improving the resiliency of the network in the situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack. We then evaluate the security of the proposed scheme against cyber-attack, as well as network performance in terms of delay and overhead.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831169","EMSA;IEEE 802.11s;SAE;Smart Grid;security attacks;security protocols;wireless mesh networks","Authentication;Computer crime;Delays;Logic gates;Mesh networks;Microwave integrated circuits","computer network security;cryptography;real-time systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","4-way handshaking protection;HAN;NAN;cyber attack;data packets;denial of service attack;hash based encryption;home area networks;hop-by-hop basis;installation;key distribution;message protection;neighborhood area networks;real-time control;real-time monitoring;scalability;self-configuration;self-healing;smart grid;substation-plant-generation;wireless mesh network security;wireless mesh-sensor networks","","1","","20","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","","978-0-7695-3843-3","978-1-4244-5068-8","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality. The experimental results show that by combining our defined ROC curve-based measure, namely relative expected cost, our developed filter can achieve a better outcome in the aspect of cost consideration.","2159-1547","978-1-4577-1778-9","","10.1109/CIMSA.2012.6269608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269608","Computational Intelligence;False Alarm Reduction;Intelligent Decision Support and Control Systems;Intrusion detection;Performance Measurement","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Support vector machines","alarm systems;computer network security;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation","NIDS;ROC curve-based measure;cost analysis;decision quality;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network attacks;network environment;network intrusion detection system;single-algorithm performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","2-4 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the best first and genetic algorithm search strategies by removing much more redundant features and still keeping the classification accuracies or even getting better performances.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438117","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0-1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming","Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Machine learning;Polynomials;Testing","Bayes methods;correlation theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;security of data;tree searching","Bayesnet machines;IDS;best-first-CFS;branch-and-bound algorithm;classification accuracy;correlation feature selection;expert knowledge;feature selection algorithm;filter method;fractional programming problem;genetic algorithm;improving effectiveness;intrusion detection systems;linear programming problem;machine learning;optimization problem;redundant features;traffic features","","8","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, a lot of attacks against distributed environment are aimed at the trust management. This article presents a new trust management framework (TMF) for Mobile Ad hoc Networks. The proposed framework calculates a node's trust value based on observations from neighbour nodes by using Grey theory and Fuzzy sets. The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment. The TMF has shown good performance in calculating trust values of mobile wireless nodes under normal and abnormal (attack) conditions, and hence can be considered as an effective trust framework for MANETs.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120813","Fuzzy Se;Grey theory;MANET;Random Waypoint;trust management framework","Indexes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Wireless networks","fuzzy set theory;grey systems;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;TMF;fuzzy set theory;grey theory;malicious behaviour detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile wireless nodes;random waypoint mobility mode;selfish behaviour detection;trust management framework;wireless network security","","1","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the research compared the processing speed of these approaches with generic hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in Matlab and compared the accuracy of the clusters with the clusters created by human raters. The results show that both of the proposed approaches are more efficient and accurate than the generic hierarchical clustering algorithm.

We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively.

Since profiling complex sequential data is still an open problem in anomaly detection, there is a need to explore new approaches. While previous research has used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for anomaly-based intrusion detection, the proposed models tend to increase rapidly in complexity in order to increase the detection rate while reducing the false detections. In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM). Our process trace clustering approach using HMMs for system call anomaly detection provides accurate results and reduces the complexity required to detect anomalies. In this paper, we show how system call traces processed with our HMM method can provide a path forward to improved intrusion detection techniques.","","","","10.1109/SERE-C.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901637","Anomaly detection;HMMs;system call traces","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training","hidden Markov models;pattern clustering;security of data","anomalous behavior detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection;clustering approach;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection techniques;multi-HMM approach;system call anomaly detection","","0","","26","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Security Incident Origin Discovery (SIOD): IP Transaction Tracking for Centralized Cyber Defense","Charbonneau, N.; Newman, B.; Pecelli, D.","MITRE Corp., Bedford, MA, USA","Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), 2014 IEEE","20141120","2014","","","30","39","In many enterprise Internet Protocol networks, Network Address Translation and other traffic forwarding techniques protect interior assets from exterior threats by minimizing exposure to just a single, hardened point. Complex networks may incorporate several layers of such protection. However, this obfuscation also hinders legitimate cyber security functions, discovering the complete path of a suspicious traffic flow requires inspecting forwarders' logs, unraveling one layer of concealment at a time. These challenges are compounded when centralized cyber-defense teams must pursue suspicious activity across numerous regional and individual site networks. Identifying a single host at the end of a dubious transaction may require coordination among central, regional, and local administrators, as well as human review of many intermediary devices' activity logs. In this paper, we describe an approach to automate the investigation process by correlating details of alerts and forwarder records to iteratively discover the chain of forwarders implicated in a given transaction. By rapidly revealing a suspicious transaction's true endpoints, incident response times can be dramatically reduced, allowing for rapid intervention and analysis. We present our prototype tracing algorithm in pseudo-code, describe the diverse lab environment in which it was developed, and detail specific trace scenarios for both web and Domain Name Service traffic. We address unique log formats and behaviors of different forwarders and recommend practices for specific units. Finally, we discuss means to integrate investigation triggers and results into existing Security Information and Event Management deployments, empowering cyber-defense analysts without further complicating their workflows.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956734","cyber-defense;cyber-security;network","Detectors;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Internet;Ports (Computers);Servers","IP networks;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IP transaction tracking;Internet protocol networks;SIOD;centralized cyber defense;cyber security functions;cyber-defense analysts;event management deployments;network address translation;prototype tracing algorithm;pseudo-code;security incident origin discovery;security information;traffic flow;traffic forwarding techniques","","0","","15","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All steps of PCA starting from the mean computation to the projection of data onto the new space, passing by the normalization process, covariance matrix and the eigenvectors computation are developed in C and synthesized using the new Xilinx VIVADO high level synthesis (HLS). The computation of the eigenvectors was based on the iterative Jacobi method. The designed hardware for computing the learning part of PCA on the Zynq system on chip showed that it can be faster than its 64-bit Intel i7-3770 processor counterpart with a speed up of 1.41.

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic “in the dark”.","","978-1-4577-1481-8","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN","Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management","","0","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The possibility to automatically and dynamically scale network services at run time is one of the main claims of NFV. Elastic NFV could be similar to what elastic cloud services provide for compute, with pay-per-use cost models for customers. However, control of resources for elastic services is far from trivial. We show how current NFV and SDN architectures could support elastic resource services for network functions (NFs). We reveal that the current NFV architecture does not allow recursive resource orchestration, therefore preventing resource scaling requests from being handled by a resource orchestrator overseeing the entire domain where an NF is executed. We introduce a logical centralization of joint compute and network resource orchestration as a UNIFY framework, which enables direct control of elastic resources for the NFs. We show opportunities and challenges associated with such an architecture.","0890-8044","","","10.1109/MNET.2015.7113220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113220","","Computer architecture;Firewalls (computing);Logic gates;Network architecture;Noise measurement;Telecommunication network management;Telecommunication standards;Virtualization","cost reduction;resource allocation;software defined networking;virtualisation","NF;SDN;UNIFY framework;business models;cost reductions;elastic NFV;elastic cloud services;elastic network functions;elastic services;joint compute-network resource orchestration;logical centralization;network function virtualization;network services;pay-per-use cost models;resource scaling requests;software defined networking","","0","","","","","May-June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. In this paper we are proposing a techniques, which maintain the small distributed signature database and dynamically update it based on the change in network environment. Overall objective of the research work is to improve the efficiency and self configurability of the IDS in a dynamic and changing environment.","","978-1-4799-6928-9","","10.1109/CICN.2014.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065647","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database","Classification algorithms;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Intrusion detection;distributed signature database;heterogeneous computer network;network traffic;self tuning IDS","","0","","21","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The gait characteristic of a normal walker in the nature state is an average gait period of 1.2s, in which a step period is about 0.6s and a foot touchdown time is about 0.2s. When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.3–0.75s and a duration time of 0.15–0.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one.

The need is not only for preventing the attack but also for detecting such attacks if it happened. Intrusion detection systems is built to do this task and complement other security systems.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","0","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy. Security is another problem involved in this paper.

The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace.

We use the multi-agent paradigm to model the proposed distributed system. In this system, an agent, which plays several roles, is situated on each node of the net. The first role of an agent is to perform the work of a local intrusion detection system (IDS). Periodically, it proceeds to exchange security data within its local neighbouring. The agent neighbouring consists of IDS agents of local neighbour nodes. The goal of such an approach is to consolidate the decision, regarding every suspected security event. Unlike previous works having proposed distributed systems for intrusion detection, our system is not restricted to data sharing. It proceeds in the case of a conflict to a negotiation between neighbouring agents in order to produce a consensual decision. So, the proposed system is fully distributed. It does not require any central or hierarchical control, which compromises its scalability, specially in wide area networks such as Internet. Indeed, in this kind of networks, some attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) require fully distributed defence.

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation experiments are performed based on the KDD 99 dataset. During the process of the experiments, two arguments, the sample number and the base classification number, are discussed to test their effect on the final result.

However, existing device-free solutions mainly use sensors and active RFID tags, which are much more expensive compared to passive tags. In this paper, we propose a novel motion detection and tracking method using passive RFID tags, named Twins. The method leverages a phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We theoretically explain this phenomenon via an interference model and conduct extensive experiment to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype with commercial off-the-shelf reader and tags. Experimental results show that Twins is effective in detecting the moving object, with low location errors of 0.75m in average.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847970","Critical State;Device-free;Passive RFID tag;Tracking","Antennas;Couplings;Motion detection;Particle filters;Prototypes;Radiofrequency identification;Tracking","motion estimation;object detection;object tracking;radiofrequency identification;radiofrequency interference;safety systems","Twins based intrusion detection system;active RFID tags;commercial off-the-shelf reader;critical state;device-free based object tracking;device-free solutions;interference model;location errors;motion detection method;noncooperative objects;passive RFID tags;tracking method;tracking systems","","6","","36","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing of attack types, rule database becomes more and more larger and the course of matching also becomes increasingly complex, which makes IDS easily to lose packets. For the problem above, two kinds of signature customization methods which based on open ports and CVE number are designed in this paper. These methods integrate the IDS and vulnerability scanner, help the misuse NIDS to select appropriate signature for the protected host and eliminate unnecessary signature matching through not modifying too much programs and setting the values of NIDS. Some experiments have been done on testing the integrated system. The results show that IDS can reduce the detection rules, useless alerts and improve detection efficiency after customization signature.","","978-1-4244-5845-5","","10.1109/ICACC.2010.5486762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486762","CVE;NIDS;signature customization;vulnerability scanner","Appropriate technology;Databases;Detection algorithms;Educational institutions;High-speed networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols;System testing","computer network security","IDS;feature matching;network intrusion detection system;signature customization methods;vulnerability scanner","","1","","7","","","27-29 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research, we introduce a new pattern classifier named Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) to this task, which has demonstrated to be similar to the state-of-the-art pattern recognition techniques, but extremely more efficient for training patterns.

There are basically two main types of detection techniques: signature-based and anomaly-based. A signature-based IDS cannot detect unknown attacks because a signature has not been written. To overcome this shortcoming, many researchers have been developing anomaly-based IDSs. Although they can detect unknown attacks, there is a problem that they just classify network traffic into normal or abnormal. Therefore, IDS operators have to manually inspect IDS alerts to classify them into known attacks or unknown attacks. Because there are a lot of alerts related to known attacks, it is difficult to extract only unknown attacks from them. In this paper, we present a method that automatically detects unknown attacks from an anomaly-based IDS alerts. We evaluate our method using Kyoto2006+ dataset.","","978-1-4673-2001-6","978-0-7695-4737-4","10.1109/SAINT.2012.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305297","anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;unknown attacks","Educational institutions;Feature extraction;IP networks;Support vector machines;Testing;Training data","digital signatures;feature extraction;security of data","IDS operators;Kyoto2006+ dataset;anomaly-based IDS alerts;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;computer systems;feature extraction;network traffic;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection systems;unknown attacks detection","","2","","7","","","16-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such as energy, computation and communication capability. Therefore. wired security mechanism can not applied in WSNs directly. It is necessary to design an security system apply to WSNs. In this paper, we proposed a new intrusion detection system (IDS) which integrates the approach of nodes behavioral strategies and evidence theory. According to the deviation from the normal level of node's behavior, basic input vector of evidence is constructed. Meanwhile, the weight algorithm is applied to represent the importance of each behavior characteristic and revise evidences before synthesis. Finally, linked with evidence theory and judgment rules, we get the detection result of the evaluated node. The simulation results show that our approach is more effective in detecting malicious nodes with higher detection ratio and lower misdetection ratio compared with existing schemes.","1347-6890","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618573","behavior characteristic;evidence theory;intrusion detection system;weight algorithm;wireless sensor networks","Monitoring;Silicon;Wireless sensor networks","pattern clustering;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IDS;WSN;cluster based wireless sensor network;evidence theory;intrusion detection system;judgment rule;malicious node detection;security mechanism","","0","","14","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many cyber attacks are spread via mechanisms that exploit weaknesses found in end-users, which makes users the weakest element in the security chain. The phishing problem is broad and no single silver-bullet solution exists to mitigate all the vulnerabilities effectively, thus multiple techniques are often implemented to mitigate specific attacks. This paper aims at surveying many of the recently proposed phishing mitigation techniques. A high-level overview of various categories of phishing mitigation techniques is also presented, such as: detection, offensive defense, correction, and prevention, which we belief is critical to present where the phishing detection techniques fit in the overall mitigation process.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2013.032213.00009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497928","Phishing;email classification;phishing detection;security;social engineering","Bibliographies;Phishing;Publishing","computer crime;computer network security","cyber attack;phishing attack detection;phishing mitigation technique;security chain;target vulnerability","","5","","54","","2013-04-15","Fourth Quarter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
