The rapid increase number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In this paper, the semantic link network model is used for organizing multimedia resources. A whole model for generating the association relation between multimedia resources using semantic link network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, and mechanisms of the semantic link network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the semantic link network and multimedia resources provides a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. The tags and the surrounding texts of multimedia resources are used to measure their semantic association. The hierarchical semantic of multimedia resources is defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different in the proposed framework. The modules of semantic link network model are implemented to measure association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two evaluation methods, including clustering and retrieval, are performed, which shows the proposed method can measure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.","2168-6750","","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2316525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786371","Big data;multimedia resources;multimedia resources organization;semantic link network","Big data;Computational modeling;Data models;Multimedia communication;Ontologies;Semantics;Streaming media","Big Data;multimedia computing;semantic networks","Flickr images;association relation generation;clustering;multimedia big data;multimedia resource organization;retrieval;semantic link network-based model;social tags;surrounding text semantics;tag semantics","","5","","35","","2014-04-10","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We consider all network packets before they reach to the end-user by extracting a certain number of features of internet worm from these packets. Our network features mainly consist of characteristics of IP address, port, protocol and some flags of packet header. These features are used to detect and classify behavior of internet worm by using 3 different data mining algorithms which are Bayesian Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In addition, our approach not only can classify internet worm apart from the normal data, but also can classify network attacks that have similar behaviors to the internet worm behaviors. Our approach provides good results with detection rate over 99.6 percent and false alarm rate is close to zero with Random forest algorithm. In addition, our model can classify behaviors of DoS and Port Scan attacks with detection rate higher than 98 percent and false alarm rate equal to zero.","","978-1-4244-6986-4","978-89-88678-20-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484868","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer worms;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","","","","4","","10","","","11-13 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High degree parallel architecture of the coprocessor allows it to run at line rate above 20 Gbps without packet losing. Furthermore, the coprocessor has deterministic search time and low memory consumption. By using Netfilter hooks in Linux network protocol stack MPC8260 manages the coprocessor to take the full charge of packet classification, so the performance of the system is not influenced much when multi-dimensional packet classification executed.

The goal of the system is to create evanescent honeypots at right places and times, on demand, to achieve better security in this ever changing environment. The system finds the machines on the network which attackers are interested in using IDS alerts and network traffic analysis. Virtual honeypots replicating those systems are then created and deployed on the network. Suspicious traffic destined for the target system is then redirected to the newly created honeypot.

This paper brings forward a intrusion detection system model named after DWIDS (A Distributed Wireless-LAN Intrusion Detection System Model based on Computer Immunology), which can be used to effectively compensate for the defects of the traditional technology on safety protection. The DWIDS applies the principles of the computer immunology to IDS; that is to say, several different detection agents work coordinately and distributedly in each AP and cooperate with each other to detect intrusions. The self-learning mechanism of the sandbox not only studies the unknown intrusions, but also abstracts the rules and collects the evidence. Nowadays, with the popularization of WLAN, the application of DWIDS undoubtedly improves the safety coefficient of entire network, increases the usage ratio of network, and decreases the fund invested in the safety troubles of enterprises and departments.","","978-1-4244-3702-3","978-1-4244-3703-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212158","Computer immunology;IDS;WLAN","Communication system security;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Power system security;Safety;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","security of data;wireless LAN","DWIDS;computer immunology;distributed wireless-LAN intrusion detection system;safety protection;wireless-LAN security model","","0","","13","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"MR-TRIAGE: Scalable multi-criteria clustering for big data security intelligence applications","Yun Shen; Thonnard, O.","Symantec Res. Labs., Dublin, Ireland","Big Data (Big Data), 2014 IEEE International Conference on","20150108","2014","","","627","635","Security companies have recently realised that mining massive amounts of security data can help generate actionable intelligence and improve their understanding of Internet attacks. In particular, attack attribution and situational understanding are considered critical aspects to effectively deal with emerging, increasingly sophisticated Internet attacks. This requires highly scalable analysis tools to help analysts classify, correlate and prioritise security events, depending on their likely impact and threat level. However, this security data mining process typically involves a considerable amount of features interacting in a non-obvious way, which makes it inherently complex. To deal with this challenge, we introduce MR-TRIAGE, a set of distributed algorithms built on MapReduce that can perform scalable multi-criteria data clustering on large security data sets and identify complex relationships hidden in massive datasets. The MR-TRIAGE workflow is made of a scalable data summarisation, followed by scalable graph clustering algorithms in which we integrate multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Theoretical computational complexity of the proposed parallel algorithms are discussed and analysed. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms can scale well and efficiently process large security datasets on commodity hardware. Our approach can effectively cluster any type of security events (e.g., spam emails, spear-phishing attacks, etc) that are sharing at least some commonalities among a number of predefined features.","","","","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004285","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Electronic mail;Open wireless architecture;Prototypes;Security","Big Data;computer crime;data mining;graph theory;parallel algorithms;pattern clustering","Big Data security intelligence applications;Internet attacks;MR-TRIAGE workflow;MapReduce;attack attribution;commodity hardware;computational complexity;distributed algorithms;large security data sets;large security datasets;multicriteria evaluation techniques;parallel algorithms;scalable data summarisation;scalable graph clustering algorithms;scalable multicriteria data clustering;security companies;security data mining;security events;situational understanding;threat level","","0","","56","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MYSEA seeks to meet two compelling requirements, often assumed to be at odds: enforcing critical, mandatory security policies, and allowing access and collaboration in a familiar work environment. Recent additions to the MYSEA design expand the architecture to support a cloud of cross-domain services, hosted within a federation of multilevel secure (MLS) MYSEA servers. The MYSEA cloud supports single-sign on, service replication, and network-layer quality of security service. This new cross-domain, distributed architecture follows the consumption and delivery model for cloud services, while maintaining the federated control model necessary to support and protect cross-domain collaboration within the enterprise. The resulting architecture shows the feasibility of high-assurance, cross-domain services hosted within a community cloud suitable for inter-agency, or joint, collaboration.

At the same time, the share of video traffic in the Internet has also significantly increased, and the two functions are getting closer to one another. YouTube, the most famous video sharing site, allows people to comment on videos with other people while Facebook and Twitter are important vectors into sharing videos. Both video channels and social networks are increasingly vulnerable attack targets. For example, social networks are also considerable spam and phishing vectors, and Adobe Flash as the premier video streaming application is associated with numerous software vulnerabilities. This is a good way for attackers to compromise sites with embedded Flash objects. In this paper, we present the technical background of the cross-domain mechanisms and the security implications. Several recent studies have demonstrated the weakness of the cross-domain policy, leading to session hijacking or the leakage of sensitive information. Current solutions to detect these vulnerabilities use a client-side approach.

Network Lab., Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ, USA","Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Transactions on","20140711","2014","9","8","1278","1287","Network security against possible attacks involves making decisions under uncertainty. Not only may one be ignorant of the place, the power, or the time of potential attacks, one may also be largely ignorant of the attacker's purpose. To illustrate this phenomenon, this paper proposes a simple Bayesian game-theoretic model of allocating defensive (scanning) effort among nodes of a network in which a network's defender does not know the adversary's motivation for intruding on the network, e.g., to bring the maximal damage to the network (for example, to steal credit card numbers or information on bank accounts stored there) or to infiltrate the network for other purposes (for example, to corrupt nodes for a further distributed denial of service botnet attack on servers). Due to limited defensive capabilities, the defender faces the dilemma of either: 1) focusing on increasing defense of the most valuable nodes, and in turn, increasing the chance for the adversary to sneak into the network through less valuable nodes or 2) taking care of defense of all the nodes, and in turn, reducing the level of defense of the most valuable ones. An explicit solution to this dilemma is suggested based on the information available to the defender, and it is shown how this information allows the authorities to increase the efficiency of a network's defense. Some interesting properties of the rivals' strategies are presented. Notably, the adversary's strategy has a node-sharing structure and the adversary's payoffs have a discontinuous dependence on the probability of the attack's type. This discontinuity implies that the defender has to take into account the human factor since some threshold values of this inclination in the adversary's behavior could make the defender's policy very sensitive to small perturbations, while in other situations it produces minimal impact.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2329241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827188","Bayesian equilibrium;computer networks;infrastructure networks;network protection;scan;search","Bayes methods;Computers;Forensics;Games;Jamming;Security;Uncertainty","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision making;game theory;human factors;probability","Bayesian game-theoretic model;adversary behavior;adversary motivation;adversary strategy;attack-type uncertainty;decision making;defensive capabilities;defensive effort;distributed denial of service botnet attack;human factor;network defender;network protection;network security;node-sharing structure","","4","","36","","2014-06-06","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, so far there is no signature based IDS which can work on resource constraint sensor nodes. This paper presents a dynamic coding mechanism, which helps in implementing a distributed signature based IDS (intrusion detection system) in IP-USN (IP based ubiquitous sensor networks).

The system is tested using a 3-fold cross-validation scheme. Publicly available datasets were also used to estimate an upper bound on the false positives generated by the system.

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner. Simulation result in NS-2 accurately predicts the performance of proposed scheme in terms of cluster energy level analysis, routing performance, system performance under varying network conditions.","","978-1-4799-4191-9","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993135","MANET;authentication;clustering;malicious node;services;trust","Artificial neural networks;Automata;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Routing protocols","data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DTV;IMTVCM;NS-2 simulation;ad hoc network;autonomous collection;cluster based MANET;cluster energy level analysis;cluster formation process;cluster head;counter table;data transmission time;dynamic topology;indirect trust value;malicious node;misbehaving node;mobile nodes;routing performance;trust value calculation;wireless links","","0","","12","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method attains high speed rate using a parallel data structure to filter out DoS and port scan attacks from network traffic before entering the intrusion detection system.

Thus, they present a significant challenge for cloud providers to comply with. As a result, the cloud providers are unable to provide SMEs with an assurance. In order to address these privacy and security issues, this paper presents the Cloud Data Security (CloudDataSec) project that aims to design cloud services adhering to government privacy laws. In particular, this paper introduces a six-layer security model for cloud computing and three level of security assurance for SMEs to take advantage of.

This approach has been chosen in order to create a flexible and cheap but reliable system, implemented using consumer electronics. Voice features are extracted by a short time cepstrum analysis, and face features are extracted using the eigenfaces technique. The recognition task is solved using the same Support Vector Machine for both voice and face features. The system learns the features of each person using SVM in a set-up phase, in which the two modalities are also bound together through a cross-anchoring learning rule based on the mutual exclusivity selection principle. In the running phase the system is able to recognize the identity of the person either using voice features, or face features or both.

Based on multidimensional resource service operators, we model the problem of trust evaluation as a process of multi-attribute decision-making, and develop an adaptive trust evaluation approach based on information entropy theory. This adaptive approach can overcome the limitations of traditional trust schemes, whereby the trusted operators are weighted manually or subjectively. As a result, using SOTS, the broker can efficiently and accurately prepare the most trusted resources in advance, and thus provide more dependable resources to users.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to verify the legitimacy of our analytical framework we have carried out detailed numerical simulations. Our simulations mimic the practical scenario where a system deployed using our framework must make a binary Yes/No “malicious decision” to each snapshot of the signal strength values obtained by base stations. The comparison between simulation and analysis shows excellent agreement.

The classification is based on the number of file server and mail server attacks observed during a fixed window. The spammer naively attacks (with a known distribution) his main target: the mail server. The spy strategically selects the number of attacks on his main target: the file server. The defender strategically selects his classification policy: a threshold on the number of file server attacks. We model the interaction of the two players (spy and defender) as a nonzero-sum game: The defender needs to balance missed detections and false alarms in his objective function, while the spy has a tradeoff between attacking the file server more aggressively and increasing the chances of getting caught. We give a characterization of the Nash equilibria in mixed strategies, and demonstrate how the Nash equilibria can be computed in polynomial time.

The extension of SN P system called trapezoidal Fuzzy Reasoning Spiking Neural P (tFRSN P) system is adopted in the network intrusion prediction model. SN P system is a neural-like computing model inspired from the way spiking neurons communicate using spikes. It has a graphical modeling advantage which makes it well suited for fuzzy reasoning as well as fuzzy knowledge representation. In order to evaluate the performance of tFRSN P system in intrusion detection, the publicly available KDD Cup benchmark dataset was employed.

Anomaly detection is an approach of intrusion detection that constructs models of normal behavior of users or systems and detects the behaviors that deviate from the model. Monitoring the sequences of system calls generated during the execution of privileged programs has been known to be an effective means of anomaly detection. In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined. And the detection algorithm is given for the application of rough set theory in intrusion detection.

Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated. It can also handle repetition of both single and multi-symbol sub-expressions.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6673707","","","computer network security;digital signatures;finite automata;symbol manipulation","Glushkov nondeterministic flnite automata;NFA;NIDS;NIDS rule sets;attack signatures;bit-parallel architecture;constrained repetitions;deep packet inspection;hardware acceleration;multisymbol subexpressions;network intrusion detection systems;regular expression repetitions;standard BP system","","0","","","","","December 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Often, these factors drive the security designers to design a perimeter intrusion detection and assessment system (PIDAS) that includes: 1) larger than desired footprint, 2) one or more animal control fences to minimize the nuisance alarm rate (NAR), and 3) clear zones and an isolation zone to facilitate intrusion detection and assessment by keeping the fence lines clear of vegetation, trash, and other objects that could impede the security system's performance.

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, wireless medical device applications may share RF spectrum resources with a host of other non medical device applications. Although hospitals traditionally segregate data network traffic and patient care data network traffic, the increased costs for a hospital to utilize two separate network infrastructures has led some to consider whether or not wireless medical devices should be integrated onto IT-type 802.11 wireless networks. While there are arguable advantages to incorporating all devices onto a single network infrastructure, there are increased potential patient safety risks that must be addressed. In order to address the increased risks of incorporating wireless medical devices on hospital's 802.11 wireless networks, thorough evaluation and testing is essential.

Leveraging properties of virtualization, virtual machine introspection (VMI) has yielded promising research for cloud security yet adoption of these approaches in production environments remains minimal due to a semantic gap: the extraction of high-level knowledge of the guest operating system's state from low-level artifacts collected out-of-VM. Within the field of forensic memory analysis (FMA), a similar semantic gap exists from the reconstruction of physical memory dumps.

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Outbound traffic are allowed in organizations since users are allowed at least to download mails, visit external web servers. A vulnerable application requesting traffic from an externally hosted server is exploited and user accessing the traffic transfers their controls to attackers listening remotely. To detect this kind of behavior, this paper focuses on deploying high interaction honeypot system coupled with intrusion detection system on different operating system flavors which work as clients. Clients collect URLs by specifically crafted web links crawler. These URLs are then visited by application needed to visit these URLs. Finally, if these URLs are malicious and exploit the application software, an alert is triggered by signature based intrusion detection system deployed on the machine. Based on these alerts, URLs are stored in a black list of malicious URLs.

This is due to the open nature of this medium that leaves it vulnerable to multiple security threats. Anyone with a transceiver can launch jamming based DoS attacks on wireless transmissions, inject spurious messages, or jam legitimate ones. Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated. Lists of parameters and variables are associated with jamming are identified and formulated to detect and classify attacks. Finally a novel IDS framework for detecting and classifying jamming attacks is proposed. This framework is found to be able to detect and classify jamming faster and more efficient.","","978-1-4673-1326-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418660","Wireless Network;classification;detection;jamming;security","Benchmark testing;Business process re-engineering;Communication system security;Jamming;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;jamming;pattern classification;radio networks","IDS framework;MAC layers;attack classification;intrusion detection system;jamming attack classification;jamming based DoS attacks;jamming detection;multiple security threats;physical layers;wireless networks;wireless transmissions","","0","","26","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection","","2","","28","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The relative preference among the objectives can be adjusted by varying the weights associated with each parameter of mathematic model.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","0","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The focus is on identifying physical indicators of an ongoing cyber attack, which can help to design more efficient detection and defense mechanisms.

In the case of parallel hybrid architecture, it's necessary that a decision engine combines both outputs of misuse and anomaly based detection systems and infers the final result. Since there is no complete solution in literature, in this paper we present our novel and comprehensive design for decision engine in hybrid network intrusion detection and prevention Systems. The overall tasks of our decision engine is firstly combining and correlating input alerts and creating meta alert, secondly inferring proper reaction corresponding to created meta alert. In our architecture, there is the possibility to apply various types of reactions. Since real time reaction is very important for overall performance, and decision making for this type of reaction highly depends on attack type, in this paper we experiment the attack classification part of our design over labeled KDD'99 dataset by attack types. Results show that our used approach has 98.0484 % accuracy of attack classification in reasonable speed.","","978-1-4673-2072-6","","10.1109/ISTEL.2012.6483125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483125","NIDPS;alert;correlation;decision;design;engine;infer;prevention;reaction;response","Accuracy;Correlation;Decision making;Engines;Intrusion detection;Ontologies","decision making;security of data","anomaly based intrusion detection;attack classification;decision engine;decision making;hybrid network intrusion detection;hybrid network intrusion prevention;input alerts;labeled KDD'99 dataset;meta alert;misuse based intrusion detection;parallel hybrid architecture;real time reaction","","0","","39","","","6-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from existing test beds that are based on simulated power flows, our test bed is built on a real power facility. The design of the test bed, including both the physical system and the cyber system, is described. Power electronics technology plays a major role in this test bed as it does in the microgrid infrastructure, and is an integral part of the testing instrumentation and methods.

In addition to providing point-to-point capability between MUOS Functional Terminals (MFTs), MUOS also provides connectivity for the user to communicate with users on the Defense Switched Network (DSN) via the DoD Teleport sites. This allows the user on-demand capability for real-time reachback through the DSN. The current MUOS baseline allows for secure communications using the Secure Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) to other SCIP-compatible and enabled devices within the DSN; however, the user community requested additional capability to allow MUOS users to establish and receive nonsecure voice calls through the DSN. The Narrowband SATCOM Systems Engineering Group (NSSEG) was given the responsibility of researching and developing solutions to allow MUOS users to connect to DSN with unclassified voice while still meeting encryption requirements over the satellite. The NSSEG was successful in identifying the requirements, candidate solutions, and obtaining the necessary funding for implementation.

It has become a great challenge to develop scalable solutions for next-generation packet classification that support higher throughput, larger rule sets and more packet header fields. For low-cost high performance embedded networking applications, the best solution could be doing packet classification by special designed hardware, which can effectively release the burden of system CPU. In order to improve the speed of packet classification, exhibit good memory performance and support quick rule update, a high-speed packet classification system based on FPGA is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of parallel processing, pipeline and hardware circuit, the throughput has been improved greatly; defining the size of the tree nodes to be binary tree, the memory usage can be more efficient. The binary tree structure is generated through pre-processing on computer, which does not influence the searching speed of FPGA. During the packet header division, the division field is dynamic and selected according to the rules. The experimental results show that the pre-processing time for 50000 rules is shorter than 0.051s, the average speed of rule-header classification for Snort IDS is higher than 10 Gbps.","1976-7684","978-1-4673-5740-1","978-1-4673-5741-8","10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496433","Binary tree;FPGA;NIDS;Packet classification","Binary trees;Clocks;Decision trees;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks","IP networks;computer network security;parallel processing;pattern classification;pipeline processing;telecommunication network routing;tree data structures","CPU;FPGA;IP packet;NIDS;Snort IDS;binary tree structure;binary-tree-based high speed packet classification system;hardware circuit;high performance embedded networking application;network intrusion detection system;next-generation packet classification;packet header division;parallel processing;pipeline processing;processor performance;router;rule-header classification;serial program execution;software-based packet classification;tree node","","2","","10","","","28-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
