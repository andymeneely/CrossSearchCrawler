It is promising to protect private data and to improve the system security by leveraging the isolation attribute of virtual machine (VM). The isolation attribute of VM is provided by Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) that runs in higher priority than guest OSes. If the critical components are isolated in VMs,access control can be enforced or attestation can be made when the subject is accessing via VMs. In this way, VMs can improve the security level of critical components such as OS, kernel, data, and applications. For computer system security, VMs can be used to detect malware intrusions and to protect critical components, which can be implemented by integrating detection or protection mechanism in either VMM or VMs. Authentication is required to create trustful VMs. This paper surveys technologies related of using virtual machines to enhance system security.","","978-0-7695-3818-1","","10.1109/ChinaGrid.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328990","Critical component;Isolation;Security;Virtual Machine;Virtual Machine Monitor","Application software;Computer applications;Data security;Kernel;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","invasive software;virtual machines","access control;authentication;computer system security;critical components;guest OS;malware intrusions;virtual machine monitor","","1","3","48","","","21-22 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection. Our experiments show that the probability of a successful evasion is low, at about 0.98% in the worst case. We implement our approach in a prototype and present some preliminary results. Overall, the proposed approach is able to consistently detect intrusions and does not introduce any additional false positives.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066523","encrypted network;intrusion detection;malicious proxy;secret-sharing","Availability;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","cryptography;probability;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","NIDS;Shamir's secret-sharing scheme;VPN;encrypted network traffic;malicious activity detection;network-based intrusion detection system;probability;virtual private network","","1","","10","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a hierarchical, autonomous, and forecasting cloud based IDS (HAF-CIDS) that continuously monitors and analyzes system events and computes the risk level. The proposed system improves the detection accuracy through the integration with a forecasting engine that runs the Holt-Winters (HW) algorithm.

IEEE 34th Conference on","20091218","2009","","","899","906","Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","","978-1-4244-4488-5","978-1-4244-4487-8","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our previous research has proposed a robust statistical method, the BACON-MVV method, that provides 100% accuracy in detecting patterns of DoS and Probing attacks, inspite of the training sets used contains suspicious packet traffic called outliers. One problem not yet being addressed by previous research was the processing time taken as the packet traffics to be analysed for detecting any intrusion grows bigger.

The wireless and distributed nature of MANETs poses a great challenge to system security designers. Ad hoc networks are by nature very open to anyone. Their biggest advantage is also one of their biggest disadvantages: Anyone with the proper hardware and knowledge of the network topology and protocols can connect to the network. This allows potential attackers to infiltrate the network and carry out attacks on its participants with the purpose of stealing or altering information. A specific type of attack, the Wormhole attack does not require exploiting any nodes in the network and can interfere with the route establishment process. The entire routing system in MANET can even be brought down using the wormhole attack. This paper discusses the modes of wormholes, how wormholes disrupts routing in AODV, DSR, OLSR and then discusses the solutions and countermeasures on wormholes.","","978-1-4244-8678-6","978-1-4244-8679-3","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5942091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5942091","AODV;Counter measures;DSR;GPS;MAC;Malicious;OLSR;Wormhole","Hardware;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","AODV;DSR;MANET;OLSR;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;route establishment process;routing system;wireless adhoc networks;wormhole attacks","","1","","27","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a scheme to classify a person's movement as intrusive or non-intrusive in a semantic way. The classification is aided with the help of sensor network. The sensor network is considered to be heterogeneous. It uses a PIR sensor for movement detection, an RFID sensor for identifying the person and an image sensor for verification. This system uses both wired and wireless networks for efficient data transfer. Data from either networks are synchronised using time and location information. The proposed Intruder Detection System identifies a person as an intruder, if there is any mismatch in the sensed information.","","978-1-61284-261-5","","10.1109/ICOAC.2010.5725357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5725357","Closed Circuit Television (CCTV);Intrusion Detection;Passive Infrared (PIR);Surveillance System;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)","Cameras;Databases;Radiofrequency identification;Semantics;Servers;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","closed circuit television;computer network security;image classification;image motion analysis;image sensors;image sequences;radiofrequency identification;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","CCTV;PIR sensor;RFID sensor;closed circuit television;data transfer;human intervention;image sensor;movement detection;passive infrared;semantic intruder detection system;surveillance system;wireless sensor network","","1","","9","","","14-16 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the security of guest virtual machines and of the applications and services they host can be improved by leveraging the additional architectural layer introduced by such a technology. This paper discusses security management for virtualized environments and provides several contributions. First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls. We believe that security management of both single virtualized hosts and distributed virtualized systems can benefit from our proposal.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578474","Malware;Security;Virtualization technology","Computer architecture;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","Kvm-SMA;distributed virtualized system;kernel virtual machine;root-kit detection test;security management architecture","","1","","15","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","5","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key features of the Swift include: 1) extremely low filter update latency for dynamic packet filtering, and 2) gigabits-per-second high-speed packet processing. Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains.

The assessment is based upon experimental work that is conducted on a controlled environment. User-to-user network performance software is used to obtain the throughput, round trip time and tunneling overhead for TCP and UDP transmission protocol. The performance of TCP and UDP through 6 to 4 tunnel is then compared over the native IPv4 and IPv6 environment. As a result, the findings prove the ease of TCP data transmission via the tunnel compared to both native networks.

This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it. Comparison of PCPD parameters for different types of misbehavior results in a comprehensible identification of their severity, network's reliability, and network's weak points.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956","anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis","Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training","security of data","file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits","","2","","24","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a distributed setting, each event is discovered by a sensor and reported to a robot. Here, we present novel algorithms aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of several existing solutions. We propose pairwise distance based matching algorithm (PDM) to eliminate long edges by pairwise exchanges between matching pairs. Our sequence dispatch algorithm (SQD) iteratively finds the closest event-robot pair, includes the event in dispatch schedule of the selected robot and updates its position accordingly. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding energy-balanced variants are obtained. We also present generalizations which handle multiple visits and timing constraints. Our localized algorithm MAD is based on information mesh infrastructure and local auctions within the robot network for obtaining the optimal dispatch schedule for each robot.

The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures.

In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family, if the machines were found to be compromised. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities. Subsequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883391","","Correlation;Entropy;Internet;Malware;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;computer network security;cryptography;entropy;fuzzy reasoning;invasive software","Internet scale infections;darknet Internet;entropy based techniques;fuzzy hashing;inference;malware infection detection;network security operators;probing activities","","0","","27","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A reflection coefficient of less than -10 dB was obtained over a measured bandwidth of 15%, from 2.30-2.68 GHz, in 2.72 GHz cutoff waveguide. Capacitive posts and evanescent-mode waveguide sections are used to form the resonators/coupling elements of the antenna's filtering sections.

PEGs are designed to help realize DSP systems in terms of forms and granularities of parallelism that are well matched to the given applications and targeted platforms. PEGs also facilitate derivation of both static and dynamic scheduling techniques,depending on the amount of variability in task execution times and other operating conditions. We show how to implement efficient PEG-based scheduling methods using real time operating systems, and to re-use pre-optimized libraries of DSP components within such implementations. Empirical results show that the PEG strategy can 1) achieve significant speedups on a state of the art multicore signal processor platform for static dataflow applications with predictable execution times,and 2) exceed classical scheduling speedups for application shaving execution times that can vary dynamically. This ability to handle variable execution times is especially useful as DSP applications and platforms increase in complexity and adaptive behavior, thereby reducing execution time predictability.","2160-0511","978-1-4673-2243-0","978-0-7695-4768-8","10.1109/ASAP.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341457","Data?ow Graphs;Digital Signal Processing;Multiprocessor Dynamic Scheduling","Digital signal processing;Dynamic scheduling;Multicore processing;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules","protocols;radio networks;signal processing","DSP applications;DSP components;PEG;digital signal processing;dynamic adaptation;dynamic scheduling opportunities;dynamic scheduling techniques;exposing parallelism;online reconfiguration;partial expansion graphs;real time operating systems;wireless communications protocols","","1","","16","","","9-11 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect the attacks hitting the network it is very obligatory to properly monitor the flow of network data. Network data is pre-processed before classification. Feature Selection is one of the preprocessing technique which eliminates irrelevant features and select more informative features from the data set with respect to the task to be performed. Feature Selection techniques is adopted as it is computationally efficient, simplified, have more feature interpretability, less learning time, improves data relevancy. Feature Selection can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies. Feature Selection selects a subset of the features in the training set and further using this subset as features in classification. Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features from the dataset. On selecting the features, classification is performed for detecting the intrusion.","","978-9-3805-4415-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100415","Attribute Evaluator;Classification;Dimensional Reduction;Feature Extraction;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Intrusion Detection","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Search methods","data reduction;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","IDS;classifier combination;dimension reduction technique;feature selection;intrusion detection system","","0","","17","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible. In the paper a performance of the evolved fuzzy classifiers with a classification accuracy of 92% is presented.","","978-1-4673-0088-9","","10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272759","Fuzzy Logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","","","","","0","","18","","","25-27 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Not all communications are credible and malpractice can arise anywhere, anytime. If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A lightweight countermeasure to cope with flooding attacks against session initiation protocol","Hussain, I.; Djahel, S.; Geneiatakis, D.; Nait-Abdesselam, F.","LIPADE, Univ. of Paris Descartes, Paris, France","Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC), 2013 6th Joint IFIP","20130627","2013","","","1","5","Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a widely used protocol for voice and video communication in Internet architecture. Due to its open nature and the lack of robust security mechanisms, SIP is vulnerable to several attacks similar to those existing in Internet infrastructure, such as the flooding attack. An attacker can use any SIP request to launch a flooding attack, leading to severe consequences at either client or server side SIP elements or both of them. In this context, end user's devices are considered more vulnerable to flooding attacks due to their limited capabilities. In this paper, we focus on INVITE flooding attack for which we propose a simple and robust detection scheme. This scheme prevents an attacker from launching an INVITE flood through a transition state table used by the proxy to analyse the incoming INVITE requests and exclude the suspicious ones. Our scheme requires also that the end-user keeps track of the time and IP addresses of each incoming request. Furthermore, we modify the header of the REGISTER request by adding a new field named Critical number which holds the value of maximum number of users or callers that could easily be handled by the end user. Unlike the existing solutions, our scheme does not require any special detection device or firewall at the SIP server. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in SIP Express Router (SER) and the obtained results have confirmed its effectiveness.","","978-1-4673-5615-2","978-1-4673-5614-5","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549057","Denial of Service;INVITE Flooding Attack;Security;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)","Computer crime;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers;Time factors","IP networks;Internet telephony;computer network security;network servers;routing protocols;signalling protocols;video communication","INVITE flooding attack;IP address;Internet;REGISTER request header;SER;SIP express router;SIP server;critical number;firewall;incoming INVITE request analysis;lightweight countermeasure;robust detection scheme;robust security mechanism;session initiation protocol;transition state table;video communication;voice communication","","0","","13","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account. So for, a group of algorithms have been created and correlated in parallel and serial configurations to present the proposed vision for NIDS. The results obtained from proposed system showing that accuracy and detection rate of ID3 classifiers is higher with (DPCA and LSA) than with traditional feature reduction methods.","","","","10.1109/CEEC.2014.6958547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958547","DM;DPCA;IDS;LSA;PCA;SVD","Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Semantics;Testing;Training","artificial intelligence;data mining;principal component analysis;security of data","DPCA;ID3 data mining;LSA;NIDS;artificial intelligence;dynamic principle component analysis;feature reduction method;latent semantic analysis;network intrusion detection system;ontology;parallel configuration;serial configuration;steady state process","","0","","9","","","25-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset. From the experiments it is evident that a closed and secluded network such as SSENet and Tstat tool help researchers in developing and analyzing a new dataset which reflects the changing scenario of network activities.","2157-0647","978-1-4577-1087-2","","10.1109/AHICI.2011.6113948","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113948","Feature Construction;NIDS;SSENet-2011;Tstat","Business;Complexity theory;Fires;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Silicon;Vectors","Internet;security of data","Internet;KDD CUP 99 dataset;NIDS;SSENet-2011;data mining;evolutionary algorithms;machine learning;network intrusion detection system;security experts","","2","","7","","","4-6 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597","Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization","Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning","probability;security of data","SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager","","4","","41","","2012-03-21","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT), as one of the main vulnerabilities of VoIP systems, is becoming an interesting source of annoyance for spammers. Transmitting bulk unsolicited messages and calls in a VoIP system could be facilitated with the use of an automated procedure (i.e., bot). As the effectiveness of legal actions in preventing these attacks is limited, various ANTI-SPIT technologies have been developed. Some approaches try to detect a sender as a spammer while he is attempting to generate calls and messages, and some others try to establish an infrastructure which makes the system unlikely for a spammer, so they prevent SPIT. Selecting one of these two approaches, (Detection or Prevention) could certainly move large volume of market share between companies. In this paper, after surveying different ANTI-SPIT solutions, a competition between two VoIP providers is proposed. Game Theory method is used to simulate this competition. Results illustrate that apart from the scientific efforts made to prevent SPIT, the VoIP providers trying to maximize their profit, prefer to use detective approaches instead.","","978-1-4577-2058-1","","10.1109/ICCAIE.2011.6162168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162168","Game theory;SIP;SPIT","Companies;Game theory;Games;Internet telephony;Protocols;Servers;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet telephony;computer network security;game theory","ANTISPIT technologies;SPITTERS;VoIP providers;VoIP systems;detection;game-theory method;prevention;spam over Internet telephony;voice over Internet protocol","","3","","17","","","4-7 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A plethora of technologies exists, that individually represent a (potentially) effective building block of a real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility, but - regrettably - they very much lack integration. We claim that a significant advancement in the convergence of such technologies is needed. While recently some achievements have been made, much is yet to be done.
