Abuse of cloud resources poses an important problem for cloud service providers. If third parties are affected by abuse, bad publicity or legal liabilities may ensue for the provider. There is an unsatisfactory level of protection against abuse of cloud offerings at the moment. In this paper, we analyse the current state of abuse detection and prevention in IaaS cloud computing. To establish what constitutes abuse in an IaaS environment, a survey of acceptable use policies of cloud service providers was conducted. We have found that existing intrusion detection and prevention techniques are only of limited use in this environment due to the high level of control that users can exercise over their resources. However, cloud computing opens up different opportunities for intrusion detection. We present possible approaches for abuse detection, which we plan to investigate further in future work.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2015.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299917","abuse;cloud computing;outbound intrusion detection","Cloud computing;Command and control systems;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Malware;Servers","","","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Seventh Annual","20090519","2009","","","378","385","Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are particularly vulnerable to attacks from malicious nodes as the reliability of all communication and data exchange on the network depends on collaboration of participating network nodes.In order to strengthen overall mobile network security and avoid attack, malicious nodes should be detected and appropriate measures taken, e.g. exclusion from network communications.In order to effectively identify malicious nodes we propose a system for Trust Evaluation and Reputation Exchange for Cooperative intrusion detection in MANETs (TEREC). Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes. Evaluation results show that a benign majority of nodes prevail over malicious attacking nodes as they are able to accurately classify network nodes based on reputation estimations.","","978-1-4244-4155-6","978-0-7695-3649-1","10.1109/CNSR.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4939153","Computer Network Security;Cooperative Systems;Mobile Communication","Communication networks;Communication system security;Computer graphics;Cryptography;Data security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Uncertainty","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","cooperative intrusion detection;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network nodes;network reliability;network security;reputation exchange;trust evaluation","","5","","17","","","11-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Lightweight Intrusion Alert Fusion System","Sheng Wen; Yang Xiang; Wanlei Zhou","Sch. of Inf.

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281","Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy","","security of data;sensor fusion","Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system","","4","","28","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a hard issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. This approach will be used to set the rules for Backtracking to determine the intrusion characteristics then to implement the “ Deny All except allowed” policy rules for prevention.

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

For these reasons, Vendors, research community, network forensics professionals and other users of Network Intrusion Detection Systems write tons of detection rules to maximally detect attacks. Despite these, numerous attacks still evade intrusion detectors because of insufficient evidence to expose the emerging threats and risks in the usage of intrusion detection technology. Thus, this paper presents a critical review of these problems. The review provides useful guidelines that can be used to enhance efficacy of intrusion detection system and to achieve high returns on investment.","0840-7789","978-1-4244-9788-1","978-1-4244-9787-4","10.1109/CCECE.2011.6030658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030658","Network intrusion detection System;Redundant attacks;failed attacks;information system auditor;network forensics;pattern matching","Computer networks;Computers;Conferences;Detectors;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Redundancy","computer forensics;computer network security","mitigation strategies;network forensics;network intrusion detection systems;risk strategies;threat strategies","","0","","18","","","8-11 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to achieve confidentiality of the sensed data it is necessary to have secret key shared between a node and its cluster head. Key management is challenging as the cluster head changes in every round in cluster based organization. In this paper we propose two schemes for key management in clustered sensor networks with changing cluster head. In Simple Secure Logical Ring (SSLR) scheme communication and computation cost incurred for key establishment is constant. Whereas in Burmester Desmedt Logical Ring (BDLR) scheme key establishment is achieved by performing (n + 1) multiplications and (n+ 5) communications, where n is the number of nodes in the cluster. Simulation results show that node compromise in the proposed schemes is handled efficiently.","","978-1-4244-7137-9","","10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560536","Cluster Head;Cluster Key;Key Management;Logical Ring","Clustering algorithms;Communication system security;Cryptography;Protocols;Silicon;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","pattern clustering;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Burmester Desmedt logical ring scheme key establishment;cluster based organization;cluster head;clustered sensor network;energy efficiency;logical ring based key management;secure logical ring scheme communication;wireless sensor networks","","1","","13","","","18-21 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An information dissemination service is one of these applications. In this service, users can get local area information from an MA, which migrates from node to node within the local area. The system need not provide any server. Instead of servers, MAs collect local information and disseminate it. One of very important problems in such a service is to make MAs survive as long as possible in the service area. Several methods to manage mobile agents have been proposed. However, the migration algorithm for MA used in these studies is a simple one. In this paper, a new migration algorithm based on the predicted lifetime of MA is proposed.

Prior works need to check the whole training database to detect anomalous objects, and hence they are not scalable for large training databases. In this paper, we propose two similarity (resp., dissimilarity) measures. We show that similarity and dissimilarity can be described by one linear equation. Based on this result, we take a novel approach to address the anomalybased intrusion detection. This approach converts all the profiles composing the training database into 2-dimensional geometric points such that these points lie on the the same line y = n-x. A simple comparison operation is sufficient to decide whether an object is normal or anomalous. Complexity analysis shows that our IDS outperforms the classical anomaly-based IDS in terms of memory and time complexity.","","978-3-8007-3432-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6210575","","Atomic measurements;Complexity theory;Databases;Intrusion detection;Testing;Timing","","","","0","","","","","18-18 April 2012","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

To make the hardware filter simple, we use a finite-input memory machine (FIMM). To reduce the memory size of the FIMM, we introduce the parallel sieve method. The proposed method is memorybased, so it is quickly reconfigurable and dissipates lower power than a TCAM-based method. The system is implemented on the Stratix III FPGA with three off-chip SRAMs and an SDRAM, where all ClamAV 514,287 virus patterns are stored.

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.","","978-1-4577-1034-6","","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563","dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine","Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines","Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine","","3","","20","","","8-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded.

The attacks themselves are long-lasting, difficult to expose and often use very advanced hacking techniques. Since they are advanced in nature, prolonged and persistent, the organizations behind them have to possess a high level of knowledge, advanced tools and competent personnel to execute them. The attacks are usually preformed in several phases - reconnaissance, preparation, execution, gaining access, information gathering and connection maintenance. In each of the phases attacks can be detected with different probabilities. There are several ways to increase the level of security of an organization in order to counter these incidents. First and foremost, it is necessary to educate users and system administrators on different attack vectors and provide them with knowledge and protection so that the attacks are unsuccessful. Second, implement strict security policies. That includes access control and restrictions (to information or network), protecting information by encrypting it and installing latest security upgrades. Finally, it is possible to use software IDS tools to detect such anomalies (e.g. Snort, OSSEC, Sguil).","","","","10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160480","","Command and control systems;Data mining;Malware;Monitoring;Organizations;Servers","authorisation;cryptography;data protection","access control;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection;attack vectors;computer systems;encryption;security policies;security upgrades;software IDS tools","","0","","14","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transmission of insufficient alert information hinders making correct decisions about attacks, leading to compromising network security. In order to maximize the benefits of data aggregation while minimizing the impact of partial alerts, this paper presents a risk-driven real-time transmission prioritization technique for implementing lossy and lossless aggregation of cyber alerts. Lossy alert aggregation and transmission are managed adaptively by allowing the prioritization and transmission of aggregated alerts according to the risk assessment of such alerts. This paper also presents a risk-driven utilization model that further adapts the aggregation and prioritization in response to dynamic network conditions. The performance results of the proposed techniques are obtained by running simulations on data collected from a mobile network. Simulation results for the aggregation of raw alerts have shown an average reduction of 51% in data storage space and bandwidth usage.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785305","Alert Aggregation;Cyber Security;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Networks;Transmission Prioritization","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Propagation losses","mobile computing;security of data","alert aggregation;alert generation;alert information;cyber alerts;data aggregation;lossless aggregation;lossy aggregation;lossy alert aggregation;mobile networks;partial alerts;real-time transmission prioritization technique;risk driven aggregation prioritization;risk driven utilization model;security data","","0","","11","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An entirely new class of emerging network attacks aims at the data plane of the network. Data plane forwarding in network routers has traditionally been implemented with custom-logic hardware, but recent router designs increasingly use software-programmable network processors for packet forwarding. These general-purpose processing devices exhibit software vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. We demonstrate-to our knowledge the first-practical attack that exploits a vulnerability in packet processing software to launch a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network infrastructure. This attack uses only a single attack packet to consume the full link bandwidth of the router's outgoing link. We also present a hardware-based defense mechanism that can detect situations where malicious packets try to change the operation of the network processor. Using a hardware monitor, our NetFPGA-based prototype system checks every instruction executed by the network processor and can detect deviations from correct processing within four clock cycles. A recovery system can restore the network processor to a safe state within six cycles. This high-speed detection and recovery system can ensure that network processors can be protected effectively and efficiently from this new class of attacks.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231636","Network security;embedded system security;network attack;network processor;processing monitor;programmable router","Computer crime;Embedded systems;Internet;Network security;Program processors;Routing protocols","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;logic devices","NetFPGA;computer networks;control plane;custom-logic hardware;data plane;denial-of-service attack;hardware-based defense mechanism;network routers;packet forwarding;packet processing software;security issues;software vulnerabilities;software-programmable network processors","","4","","40","","2012-07-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we present a model for assessing cost of responses based on three factors, the cost of damage caused by the intrusion, the cost of automatic response to an intrusion and the operational cost. The proposed approach provides consistent basis for response assessment across different systems and environment. In addition, the performance analysis indicates that automated responses systems using this cost metric COSIRS, when deployed can responds quickly enough to thwart active attacks in real time using optimal responses.

Specifically, the Zeus banking botnet is reported to have caused more than 100 million dollars in damages. This type of malware has been around for over ten years, and in 2013 alone was responsible for compromising over one-million computers. The impact of banking botnets (i.e., typically Zeus or its derivatives) can be lessened by exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of their command and control (C&C). Our approach involves: (1) fuzz testing the C&C to identify vulnerabilities and (2) designing exploits that can be used to make bot-herders less effective in their criminal endeavors. The novelty of our approach is its focus on interrogating the C&C and not the compromised clients; however we do not discourage traditional malware removal and clean-up processes. As a complement to traditional processes, we offer our approach to organizations with the proper authority for an active defense (i.e., offensive measures). We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by using the leaked Zeus 2.0.8.9 toolkit that included the C&C web application. The following security flaws exist in the Zeus 2.0.8.9 C&C web application: (1) no authentication between the zbot (i.e., client-side malware) and the C&C, (2) a lack of proper access control in the web application folders, and (3) simple clear text authentication between C&C and the remote bot-herder. Our results suggest that because of these security flaws, a range of offensive measures are viable against the Zeus C&C, including Buffer-Overflow, Denial-of-Service, and Dictionary or Brute Force Attacks.","","978-1-4799-7328-6","","10.1109/MALWARE.2014.6999411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999411","","Banking;Computer crashes;Computer crime;IP networks;Malware;Servers;Software","Internet;authorisation;bank data processing;invasive software;message authentication","C&C Web application;Web application folders;Zeus 2.0.8.9 toolkit;Zeus banking botnet;access control;banking botnets;banking system;brute force attacks;buffer-overflow;commerce system;denial-of-service;dictionary attacks;fuzz testing;inherent command and control vulnerabilities;malware;remote bot-herder;text authentication;zbot","","0","","24","","","28-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SCAMPI is designed with a memory-centric model of complexity in mind, to minimize memory traffic and enhance data reuse with a careful compile-time data layout. The experimental evaluation executed on two families of multicore processors, Cell B.E and Intel Xeon E5472, shows that it is possible to obtain a processing rate of more than 2 Gbits/sec per core with very large dictionaries and heavy hitting rates. In the largest tested configuration, SCAMPI reaches 16 Gbits/sec on 8 Xeon cores, reaching, and in some cases exceeding, the performance of special-purpose processors and FPGA. Using SCAMPI we have been able to scan an input stream using a dictionary of 3.5 millions keywords, more than an order of magnitude larger than any published result in the literature and in commercial prototypes, at a rate of more than 1.2 Gbits/sec per processing core.","","","","10.1145/1654059.1654106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375524","","","multiprocessing systems;program compilers;security of data;string matching","Cell BE;Intel Xeon E5472;SCAMPI;Xeon core;algorithmic design;compile-time data layout;data reuse;dictionary;ground-breaking string searching algorithm;hitting rate;memory traffic;memory-centric model;multicore processor;network intrusion detection system;network rate;pattern inspection;processing rate;scalable CAM-based algorithm;string matching","","1","","23","","","14-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse literature on Cloud Computing risks to emphasise its implications from a personal health information perspective. Access management, security issues, legal issues and loss of data are some of the risks that negatively impact the storing of PHRs in the Cloud. These can be mitigated by ensuring that only authorized parties are granted access; ensuring that users do not gain access to other users' data and that data remains encrypted; Cloud providers should comply to audits in order to make sure that proper regulations are followed in securing data in the Cloud; and making backups in case of data loss.

We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later. We present algorithms that apply speculation in single-threaded software running on commodity processors as well as algorithms for parallel hardware. Experimental results show that speculation leads to improvements in latency and throughput in both cases.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2011.2112647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710582","Low latency;multibyte;multibyte matching;parallel pattern matching;parallel regular expression matching;regular expressions;speculative pattern matching","Couplings;Doped fiber amplifiers;Hardware;History;Pattern matching;Software algorithms;Throughput","database management systems;pattern matching;security of data","IPS;intrusion prevention systems;parallel hardware;speculative parallel pattern matching","","5","","33","","2011-02-10","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.","","978-1-4673-5832-3","","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516336","Anomaly Detection;Change Detection;Network Intrusion;Outlier Detection;Performance Evaluation;Threshold Algorithms","","data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;SVM;change detection algorithm;change point outlier detection method;classification error;data analysis;data collection;data exchange;data mining;distributed solution procedure;false alarm rate minimization;frequently changing trend identification;information exchange;intelligence building;intelligent subsystem;intrusion detection analysis;learning;network data;network security;real time intrusion detection system;registration error;support vector machine;system security;timely detection","","0","","18","","","26-28 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680854","Classifier combination;False positive rate;Intrusion Detection;SCADA;Security","Accuracy;Data models;Intrusion detection;Protocols;SCADA systems;Testing","SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;security of data;unsupervised learning","DNP3;Ethernet/IP;MODBUS;SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;data injection;electricity generation;gas production;oil production;public networks;standard protocols;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unsupervised intrusion detection technique;unsupervised learning algorithms;water treatment","","1","","41","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.","","","","10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243","Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing.

To achieve these goals, several papers have explored the concept of mutual revocation (sometimes termed suicide) wherein the trust value of both the accuser and the accused node are temporarily set to zero without involving a quorum. In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, many anomaly detection systems employ CFGs. Unfortunately, typical CFG-based systems rely on inaccurate or impractical heuristics. For example, the state space may be restricted by considering only a call graph, thus reducing accuracy and precision. In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems. We anticipate this technique can be used to detect jump-based return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks on the Linux platform.","2325-6648","","","10.1109/DSNW.2013.6615519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615519","","Flow graphs;Malware;Monitoring;Programming;Radiation detectors","Linux;flow graphs;security of data","BARLEY;CFG;Linux platform;ROP attacks;anomalous behavior;anomaly detection systems;call graph;control flow graphs;jump-based return-oriented programming attack detection;program behavior modelling;program execution;resource consumption information;resource usage;state space","","0","","16","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets.

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison. We further conduct a study to evaluate this mechanism under a cloud scenario and identify several open problems and issues for designing such a privacy-preserving mechanism for IDSaaS in a practical environment.","","","","10.1109/INCoS.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630405","Cloud Environment;IDSaaS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Privacy Preserving;Signature Matching","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads","cloud computing;data privacy;digital signatures","IDS-as-a-Service;IDSaaS;anomaly-based detection;cloud computing;cloud provider;fingerprint-based comparison;packet inspection;privacy concerns;privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism;privacy-preserving signature;signature matching process;signature-based detection","","0","","47","","","9-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cyber Security has become a matter of national, economic, and societal importance. Present-day attacks on the nation's computer systems do not simply damage an isolated machine or disrupt a single enterprise system. Instead, modern attacks target infrastructure that is integral to the economy, and daily life. Computer networks have joined food, water, transportation, and energy as critical resources for the functioning of the national economy.

For example, an authentication protocol is used to verify and authorize agents acting on behalf of users to protect restricted data and information. After authentication, two agents should be entitled to believe that they are communicating with each other and not with intruders. For specifying and reasoning about the security properties of authentication protocols, many researchers have proposed the use of belief logics. Since authentication protocols are designed to operate in dynamic environments, it is important to model the evolution of authentication systems through time in a systematic way. We advocate the systematic combinations of logics of beliefs and time for modeling and reasoning about evolving agent beliefs in MASs. In particular, we use a temporal belief logic called TML<sup>+</sup> for establishing trust theories for authentication systems and also propose a labeled tableau system for this logic. To illustrate the capabilities of TML<sup>+</sup>, we present trust theories for several well-known authentication protocols, namely, the Lowe modified wide-mouthed frog protocol, the amended Needham-Schroeder symmetric key protocol, and Kerberos.

This paper also reflects about the next generation attacks like Man in the Middle Attack, Denial of Service Attack and Eavesdropping. The security methods and tools which helps to find the protection against different types of attacks is also shown in this paper.","","978-1-4799-8889-1","","10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7148407","Access Control Attack;Authentication Attack;Availability Attack;Confidentiality Attack and Integrity Attack","Access control;Authentication;Communication system security;Protocols;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;authorisation;computer network security","3G networks;4G networks;access control;channel assignment;denial of service attack;man in the middle attack;security threats;wireless network attacks","","0","","15","","","15-16 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Towards the disadvantages of Fuzzy C-means clustering (referred to as FCM) forensics analysis that it is very sensitive to initial data and impacted greatly by noise, a dynamic forensics analysis technology based on genetic-fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed. The genetic-fuzzy clustering algorithm not only plays fully global optimization ability of genetic algorithm and local optimization capacity of FCM algorithm but also balances effectively algorithm to clustering space exploration. The experimental results by using KDD CUP99 Data, show that this method could better improve the efficiency and lower the false rate, at the same time, further improve the comprehensive performance of dynamic forensics analysis system.","","978-1-4244-4909-5","","10.1109/ICISE.2009.910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5455120","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Forensics;Genetic algorithms;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Performance analysis","computer forensics;data mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms","FCM;criminal invasion information;dynamic forensics analysis technology;fuzzy c-means clustering;genetic-fuzzy clustering algorithm;global optimization","","0","","5","","","26-28 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are many issues that have not been completely solved for PCRE matching on hardware platform. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based PCRE matching architecture that effectively improves the constraint repetition, an importance feature of PCRE. We enhance our architecture to handle m flag which is a powerful PCRE modifier. Besides, a tool-chain for auto-generating PCRE matching engine is also implemented. Our experimental results on low-cost Altera Cyclone II chip shows that our architecture can achieve throughput up to 1Gbps and save up to 92.74% hardware resource as compared with the conventional architecture.","","978-1-4244-5606-2","978-1-4244-5607-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491404","","Automata;Computer architecture;Computer science;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Programmable logic arrays;Protection","","","","1","","7","","","19-21 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As more and more crucial applications of Wireless Sensor Networks are being found, more needs to be done to ensure the safety of the data and network. Intrusion detection is a method to find and establish appropriate defenses against any malicious attack on the network. However standard intrusion detection practices alone cannot ensure the safety of the wireless sensor networks due to various constraints on the power, memory and battery life of the sensors and on many other uncertain factors. In this paper we present an intrusion detection scheme using Neural Networks, Rough sets and Firefly Algorithm (FA).","","","","10.1109/ICGCE.2013.6823522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823522","firefly algorithm;intrusion detection;neural network;rough set","Algorithm design and analysis;Brightness;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Rough sets;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;radial basis function networks;rough set theory;wireless sensor networks","FA;RBF neural network;data safety;firefly algorithm;hybrid network intrusion detection model;malicious attack;network safety;radial basis function neural network;rough set;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dept., Macquarie Univ., Sydney, NSW","Engineering of Complex Computer Systems, 2009 14th IEEE International Conference on","20090623","2009","","","202","209","In this paper we propose a dynamically invoked service based access control (SBAC) model to efficiently deal with the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The main idea of the SBAC is based on the observation that if the routers have information about the services that are running on the end host and can identify the upper layer traffic from the IP packet payload, then it becomes easy to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic for that particular victim server. To minimise the overhead on the routers, the SBAC model is invoked during the attack times only and the victimpsilas traffic is processed separately. The boundary routers in SBAC model validate each incoming packet to the victim on a per server basis. Only the packets that are considered to be accessing the legitimate services are passed and the remaining packets are dropped. Hence, at this stage the victimpsilas network is immune to any dynamic changes in attack pattern if the attack packets are not accessing the legitimate services at the victim end. The packets that are considered to be accessing legitimate services of the victim machine/network are marked with a unique ID and destined to the victim. If any of the received packets are found to be malicious, the unique ID enables the victim to identify service specific attack signature for each ingress SBAC router and prevent the attack traffic at that particular router. We will also discuss how the SBAC model deals with attacks on the infrastructure of the autonomous system.","","978-0-7695-3702-3","","10.1109/ICECCS.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090528","Access control;Autonomous System;Denial of Service;Traceback","Access control;Computer crime;Computer network management;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Reflection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;authorisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DDoS attack;IP packet payload;Internet;SBAC router model;autonomous system;distributed denial of service attack;legitimate service;malicious attack traffic;service-based access control model","","4","","30","","","2-4 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protecting these assets from frequently network attacks needs to deploy some distributed security systems. However the amount of data produced by many distributed security tools can be overwhelming. So it's very difficult and limited to get the most risky alert through manual process based on the huge network alerts with many attributes. The common method used to rank the alerts is scoring function, the higher the score, the more risky of the alert. Our motivation is that many times, user can not precisely specify the weights for the scoring function as their preference in order to get the preferable Ranking. In this paper, we propose a sampling method to mining user's preference. Based on this preference, the most risky alerts can be easily ranked for emergency response. An extensive performance study using both synthetic and real datasets is reported to verify its effectiveness and efficiency.","","978-1-4673-2630-8","","10.1109/DCABES.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385278","Network Security Evaluation;Preference;Ranking;Sampling;Top K","Accuracy;Computer networks;Computers;Educational institutions;Sampling methods;Security;Vectors","data mining;information systems;sampling methods;security of data","distributed security systems;distributed security tools;emergency response;information system;network infrastructure;sampling method;scoring function;user preference mining","","0","","8","","","19-22 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experiments on Darpa99 and Darpa2000 shows the method can be used to effectively discover attack procedures and run online.","","978-0-7695-3646-0","","10.1109/WMWA.2009.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232489","frequent closed sequence;intrusion detection;intrusion scenario;meta-alert sequence","Correlation;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Security;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Statistical analysis","data mining;security of data","alert database;automatic attack scenario construction;correlation rule;frequent closed sequence mining;intrusion detection system;intrusion scenario;meta-alert sequence mining","","0","","6","","","6-7 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
