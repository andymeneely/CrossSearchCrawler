When the intrusion is detected, the data services need to be discontinued immediately to retain the security and the integrity of the valuable data, till the system is recovered from the threat. By discontinuing data services, the end users may face inconveniences in using the system because of its temporary unavailability. Data hibernation addresses a mechanism of secure transferring of data and providing an access of the data alternatively keeping the data integrity intact. Data hibernation involves three steps i.e. designing an alternate schema for storing data, transferring data to that alternate storage and providing an access to that data. Hence the system can continue to provide data services securely to the end user even in the threat situations.","","978-1-61284-689-7","","10.1109/ISCI.2011.5958998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958998","Data Hibernation;Dimensions;IDS (Intrusion Detection System);System Availability","Availability;Data mining;Data models;Databases;Intrusion detection","security of data","Data hibernation framework;data services;intrusion threat","","0","","23","","","20-23 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A high relevance value of a scatterplot means better predictability among of classes based on two features. We take advantage of this information to generate a ranking for features usefulness. We compared our method to two well-known feature selection methods using three real medical datasets.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many security issues in the back end database and many security measures being implemented in order to protect it. The problem here is, the front end application has set accessible by everyone and the attackers are trying to compromise the web front end application which in turn compromise the back end database.

To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack.

In this paper, we develop a formal model that allows us to quantitatively reason about the outcomes of the policy enforcement process in both absolute (i.e., user to ideal case) and relative (i.e., user to user) terms. Within this framework, it becomes possible to quantify, e.g., the robustness of a user's proof of authorization to possible perturbations in the system, how close an unauthorized user is to satisfying a particular policy, and relative “top-k” style rankings of the best users to carry out a particular task. To this end, we explore several interesting classes of scoring functions for assessing the robustness of authorization decisions, and develop criteria under which these types of functions can be composed with one another. We further show that these types of functions can be extended to quantify how close unauthorized users are to satisfying policies, which can be a useful risk metric for decision making under unexpected circumstances.","1940-1434","978-1-4244-7510-0","978-1-4244-7511-7","10.1109/CSF.2010.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5552647","access control;policy;risk;trust management","Authorization;Construction industry;Context;Decision making;Measurement;Robustness","authorisation;conformance testing;decision making;theorem proving","authorization;binary decision problem;decision making;formal model;policy compliance testing;policy enforcement process;proof quantitative analysis;relative top-k style rankings;trust management process","","1","","33","","","17-19 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction, and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each device to continuously maintain the information required to properly route traffic. Such networks may operate by themselves or may be connected to the larger Internet. As the importance of MANET increases day to day, the vulnerability issues in MANET is important to be considered. The main issue concerned with MANET is partial dropping, ambiguous collisions, collusion. The implementation of a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs.

We use the bus nodes as the cluster-heads to gather the routing control messages and data packets transmitted among the vehicles. The bus nodes first transmit the original network behavior information to the access points deployed along the road sides. Then the access points can get a global view of the VANETs, and we can detect anomaly behaviors through analyzing the data. The anomaly detection method is based on the neural network which can build the normal network behavior model through learning process. After the trained neural network is stable, it can monitor the VANETs security by detecting the network control message and data packet in real time and alarm immediately if there is anomaly behavior. The experiments in NS2 show that the detection method can detect anomaly behavior with low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-5821-9","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497798","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Neural networks;Routing;Spine;Spread spectrum communication;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;neural nets;packet radio networks;security of data;system buses;telecommunication network routing;vehicles","BUSNet;NS2;VANET;data packet;dynamic topology;intrusion detection system;learning;multihop cooperative routing;neural network;routing control;vehicular ad hoc networks","","1","","25","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously known designs.","","978-1-4799-7746-8","","10.1109/CDC.2014.7039433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039433","","Algorithm design and analysis;Control systems;Detectors;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Stochastic processes","security of data;stochastic games","CPS;Nash equilibrium strategies;attackers;control cost;cyber state;cyber-physical systems;defense mechanisms;defense policies;detection mechanisms;detection mode;moving-horizon hybrid stochastic game model;physical states;saddle-point equilibrium policy;secure control;switching strategies;system dynamics;system frameworks;system security overhead;zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-0989-9","978-1-4673-0988-2","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","5","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This distributed security model adopts a bottom-up approach such that each cluster of end-user hosts is first secured using the CSG architecture. These different CSGs are then centrally managed by the Network Administrator. A file-based firewall update mechanism is used for dynamic real-time security. IPsec is used to secure the firewall policy update distribution while X.509 certificates cater for sender/receiver authentication. The major benefits of this approach to distributed security include tamper resistance, anti-spoofing, anti-sniffing, secure real-time firewall updating, low overall network load, high scalability and low firewall convergence times.","","978-1-4244-2912-7","978-1-4244-2913-4","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808875","Layer 2 per-packet load balancing;distributed cluster security;distributed firewall;stateful CSG architecture","Authentication;Convergence;Filtering;Load management;Protection;Prototypes;Robustness;Scalability;Security;Software prototyping","authorisation;distributed processing","cluster security gateway architecture;distributed firewall architecture;dynamic real-time security;file-based firewall update mechanism;firewall policy update distribution;network administrator;receiver authentication;robust distributed security;sender authentication","","2","","31","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is important to organize this knowledge to better understand the botnet problem and its solution space. In this paper, we structure existing botnet literature into three comprehensive taxonomies of botnet behavioral features, detection and defenses. This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy. This information can be used to devise integrated detection strategies by combining complementary approaches. To provide real-world context, we liberally augment our discussions with relevant examples from security research and products.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2013.091213.00134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616686","C&C;DDoS;DNS flux;IP flux;bot;bot family;botmaster;botnet;complex event processing;cyberfraud;cyberwarfare;fast flux service network;spam;spambot;stepping-stone","Electronic mail;IP networks;Malware;Protocols;Servers;Social network services;Taxonomy","computer network security;invasive software","botnet behavior taxonomy;botnet detection technique;botnet phenomenon;complementary approach;integrated detection strategy;network defense mechanism;pattern classification;security","","1","","162","","2013-10-02","Second Quarter 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent times, blended attacks are popular with high severity of damage and are difficult to address using signature based anti-malware solutions. Signature based anti-malware solutions are not able to completely detect and block malware behavior. Though heuristic based anti-malware solutions are able to increase the detection rate, their false positive rate is high. Application whitelisting is effective but creates rigidity on environment.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fuelled by recent advances in networking, communications, computation, software, and hardware technologies, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is considered as the next breakthrough technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. However, realising a network of physical objects accessed through the Internet brings a potential threat in the shadow of the numerous benefits. The threat is “security”. Given that Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) leverage the potential of IoT quite efficiently, this paper faces the challenge of security attention on a particular, yet broad, context of IP-enabled WSNs. In particular, it proposes a novel threat visualisation tool for such networks, called VisIoT. VisIoT is a human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system that is capable of monitoring and promptly detecting several devastating forms of security attacks, including wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. Based on a rigorous, radial visualisation design, VisIoT may expose adversaries conducting one or multiple concurrent attacks against IP-enabled WSNs. The system's visual and anomaly detection efficacy in exposing complex security threats is demonstrated through a number of simulated attack scenarios.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247576","","Data visualization;Engines;Monitoring;Routing;Security;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;data visualisation;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IP-enabled WSN;Internet of Things;IoT systems security;Sybil attacks;VisIoT;complex security threats;concurrent attacks;hardware technologies;human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system;physical objects;radial visualisation design;security attacks;simulated attack scenarios;software technologies;threat visualisation tool;visual detection efficacy;wireless sensor networks;wormhole attacks","","","","11","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead.

In the automated intrusion detection systems, classification of n-dimensional vectors of the network traffic is a challenging area. Several research works was already done on this topic. But most of the works were presented to have high detection rates, But with false positives. In this paper, we presented a novel approach to have a high detection rate and very low false positives and false negatives in the classification of network traffic using jaccords coefficient (JC) similarity. The proposed approach is employed on low dimensional space of network traffic profiles with the KDDCUP99 dataset.

Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.","","978-1-4799-0453-2","978-1-4799-0452-5","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557670","","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Testing;Vectors","computer network security;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","MapReduce intrusion detection system;anomaly fragments discover;commodity hardware;computer networks;false alarm rates;initial cluster centroids;large data sets;particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm;premature convergence;sensitivity problem","","2","","20","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The distributed nature of the network makes centralized intrusion detection difficult, while resource constraints of the nodes and the characteristics of the wireless medium often render decentralized, node-based approaches impractical. We demonstrate that an active-probing-based network intrusion detection system (AP-NIDS) is practical for WMNs. The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS. We validate our model by means of testbed experimentation. We integrate it to our open source AP-NIDS DogoIDS and run it in an indoor wireless mesh testbed utilizing the IEEE 802.11s protocol. For the example of a selective packet dropping attack, we develop the detection states for our Bayes model, and show its feasibility. We demonstrate that our approach does not need to execute the complete set of probes, yet we obtain good detection rates.","","978-1-4799-3778-3","","10.1109/LCN.2014.6925790","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6925790","Bayes inference;Intrusion Detection;Security;Wireless Multihop Networks","Bayes methods;Equations;Intrusion detection;Probes;Spread spectrum communication;Testing;Wireless communication","Bayes methods;indoor communication;security of data;telecommunication standards;wireless mesh networks","AP-NIDS DogoIDS;Bayesian inference;Bayesian model;IEEE 802.11s;WMN;active-probing-based network intrusion detection system;indoor wireless mesh testbed;probe selection algorithm;testbed experimentation;wireless multihop networks","","0","","18","","","8-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer-using purely local observation-information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties, such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet.

Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level. Performance evaluation shows that our NetSecu system can achieve line rate with and without security function.

To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report.

In this paper we investigate existed methods of traffic detection represented mostly by IDS system and discover new indicators that can be utilized for improving botnet traffic detection. To do this we analyse the most prevalent backdoors communication protocols that stay behind of the popular botnets. As a result, we extracted new data that might be used in detection routines of IDS (Intrusion Detection System). An objective of the study is mining new indicators of compromise from botnet traffic and using them to identify cyber-attacks on IC. The analysis method assumes analysis of a communication protocol of the top botnet backdoors.

UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems. This paper describes the UnC architecture in detail, including the actions of each different kind of participant. It describes how UnC deals with well-known attack models, which are readily available on the Internet.The major contribution of this work is to open up a new door for the research community to exploit the predominance of good nodes over malicious ones in order to enhance the security of the PKI ecosystem and the Internet.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750195","Internet architecture;PKI infrastructure;geographic clusters;notary nodes;security;self-certifying addresses","Artificial neural networks;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Public key;Publishing","Internet;public key cryptography","DNSSEC protocols;Internet unite-and-conquer architecture;PKI model;S-BGP protocol;UnC architecture;public key infrastructure ecosystem;secure BGP protocol;secure DNS protocols;self-certifying mechanism","","0","","41","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since different attacks need different subsets to have better detection accuracy, this paper describes an improved feature selection algorithm to identify most appropriate subset of features for a certain attack. The proposed method is based on MAHALANOBIS Distance feature ranking and an improved exhaustive search to choose a better combination of features.

This makes mobile devices a valuable source of digital evidence. For this reason, the technological evolution of mobile devices has raised the need to develop standardised investigation process models and procedures within the field of digital forensics. This need further supports the fact that forensic examiners and investigators face challenges when performing data acquisition in a forensically sound manner from mobile devices. This paper, therefore, aims at testing the harmonised digital forensic investigation process through a case study of a mobile forensic investigation.

A tiny RFID tag is attached to a mobile object, which can be scanned and recognized by a reader. RFID offers opportunities for real-time item identification and inventory tracking. For applications using resource-restricted RFID tags and mobile hand-held readers, however, various risks could threaten their abilities to provide essential services to users. High mobility of the RFID system components and the open nature make an RFID system vulnerable to various attacks. Currently, although some techniques exist that might help improve survivability; there is still no complete proposal on survivability of an RFID system despite its growing popularity and importance in many applications. In this paper, we study survivability issues related to RFID systems and survey existing techniques whose usability and adaptability toward survivability would be beneficial. Survivability is defined as the ability of a system to continuously provide essential services to support the system's mission even in the presence of malicious attacks or system failures. We discuss the issues and challenges in developing survivable RFID systems and propose research directions.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2043949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440949","Attack;radio frequency identification (RFID);recovery;survivability","","radiofrequency identification;security of data;ubiquitous computing","citizen identification;healthcare;high integrity settings;high security settings;inventory tracking;national defense;resource restricted RFID tags;survivability issues;survivable RFID systems","","18","","58","","2010-04-01","July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The most important fact about wireless network is it is mobile. It is thus used in many fields. One of the most important applications of wireless networks is Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) in which all the nodes work as both transmitter and receiver. MANETs are used in various fields like military, industry and emergency recovery. So it is important to have a firsthand knowledge about MANETs. But there is a certain drawback in MANETs, that it becomes prone to malicious attacks very fast. To avoid such attacks a good intrusion detection and prevention system is needed. In this paper, we have proposed a system which can detect as well as prevent the malicious attacks. The system is named as Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK). EAACK gives a better malicious-behavior-detection than the traditional approaches.","","","","10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087032","Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR);Received Signal Strength (RSS);Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Receivers;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc network;prevention system;secure intrusion detection","","0","","12","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these challenges, new detection systems which do not rely on knowledge of internal device state are investigated here. This paper shows that this lack of state information requires an additional metric (The exchange timeout window) for detection of WLAN Denial of Service Probe Flood attacks. Variability in this metric has a significant influence on the ability of a detection system to reliably detect the presence of attacks. A parameter selection method is proposed which is shown to provide reliability and repeatability in attack detection in WLANs. Results obtained from ongoing live trials are presented that demonstrate the importance of accurately estimating probe request and probe response timeouts in future Independent Intrusion Detection Systems.","","","978-1-84919-550-8","10.1049/cp.2012.2110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6552453","Frames;Intrusion;MAC;Probe;WLAN","","computer network reliability;computer network security;parameter estimation;wireless LAN","WLAN;attack detection performance;attack detection reliability;attack detection repeatability;denial of service probe flood attacks;exchange timeout window;independent intrusion detection system;parameter selection method;probe interval estimation effect;state information;unprotected networks","","2","","","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","","","","10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975641","Anomaly Detection;Software Security;Trace Analysis","Engines;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Servers;Testing;Training","digital forensics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","TotalADS;automated anomaly detection framework;automated software anomaly detection system;daily emergence;execution traces;extensible Eclipse-based open source framework;forensic insights;host-based anomaly detection;modern Linux server;normal trace stream;software system;software threats;system administrators resort;system scanners","","0","","27","","","28-29 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The difficulty to define the filtering rules lies where normal and anomaly packets have to be distinguished in incoming packets. The purpose of our research is to explore the early detective method for anomaly accesses based on statistic analysis. In this paper, we defined the chi-square method, and then analyze the all amount of incoming packets to our College focusing on the source IP address using chi-square method. As the results, we were able to extract the following features. Firstly, the number of packets was the more suitable scale of the window in the chi-square method than the time scale. Secondly, the setting of the window size with 500 packets and 2 bins made the detection of the DoS attacks within 10 minutes for DNS packets possible. Finally, we verified that the DoS attacks from the same source IP address was detected using the chi-square method.","","978-1-4244-3569-2","978-0-7695-3575-3","10.1109/CISIS.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066799","Anomaly access;Chi-square method;DNS;DoS attacks","Competitive intelligence;Computer crime;Educational institutions;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Software systems;Testing;Web server","IP networks;authorisation;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP packet;access filtering mechanism;chi-square method;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;statistic analysis","","1","","7","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a mathematical model of the system to study these pitfalls and propose a robust security framework for the smart grid. Our framework adopts the Kalman filter to estimate the variables of a wide range of state processes in the model. The estimates from the Kalman filter and the system readings are then fed into the χ<sup>2</sup>-detector or the proposed Euclidean detector. The χ<sup>2</sup>-detector is a proven effective exploratory method used with the Kalman filter for the measurement of the relationship between dependent variables and a series of predictor variables. The χ<sup>2</sup>-detector can detect system faults/attacks, such as DoS attack, short-term, and long-term random attacks. However, the studies show that the χ<sup>2</sup>-detector is unable to detect the statistically derived false data-injection attack. To overcome this limitation, we prove that the Euclidean detector can effectively detect such a sophisticated injection attack.","2325-5870","","","10.1109/TCNS.2014.2357531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6897944","Cyber physical system;Kalman filter smart grid;false data injection attack;security","Detectors;Kalman filters;Mathematical model;Security;Smart grids","Kalman filters;computer network security;fault diagnosis;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","χ2-detector;DoS attack;Euclidean detector;Kalman filter;communication infrastructure;denial-of-service attack;dependent variables;false data-injection attack;predictor variables;random attack;robust security framework;smart-grid systems security;state processes","","1","","24","","2014-09-12","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","0","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
