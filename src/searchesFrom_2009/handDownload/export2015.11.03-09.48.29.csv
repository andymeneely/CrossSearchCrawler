It provide advantages such as reporting consolidated data, reducing data redundancy, improving network lifetime etc. However, deploying WSNs in hostile and remote environments presents security vulnerabilities that can lead to various security attacks such as energy based attacks, attacks on data aggregation etc. Numerous secure DA techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, lightweight models using Trust Monitoring System (TMS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are limited. This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network. In this way, the proposed model identifies and isolates the malicious nodes from the data aggregation process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this model.","","978-1-4799-6760-5","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.7150633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150633","Data aggregation;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;malicious activity;security;trust monitoring system","Computational modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Nickel;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","head selection;intrusion detection systems;secure data aggregation;trust monitoring system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","16-18 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, P2P networks are vulnerable to security threats such as Internet worms and facilitate their propagation. Internet worms and more generally malware are a major concern to the network security community. There are many different type of worms in the wild, mostly categorized based on how they find and infect their new victims (i.e. active, passive, etc.). In this paper, we investigate a new approach for detecting passive worms and malware in P2P networks based on the popularity of files in the network. As part of our investigation, we crawl the Gnutella P2P network over a 12 day period collecting file names and file popularity statistics. We are then able to extract the highly popular files and identify worm/malware files within them with high accuracy.","","978-1-4244-9719-5","978-0-7695-4322-2","10.1109/EUC.2010.133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703577","Detection;Peer-to-Peer;Worm","","Internet;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","Gnutella P2P network;Internet;malware detection;passive worm detection;peer-to-peer networks;security threats","","0","","17","","","11-13 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Large number of Web applications, especially those deployed for companies to e-business operation involve high reliability, efficiency and confidentiality. Such applications are written in script languages like PHP embedded in HTML allowing establish the connection to databases, retrieving data and putting them in WWW site. In order to detect known attacks, misuse detection of web based attacks consists of attack rules and descriptions. As misuse detection considers predefined signatures for intrusion detection, here we have proposed two phases of intrusion detection mechanism. In the first phase we have used web host based intrusion detection with matching mechanism using 'Hamming Edit Distance'. We have considered here. the web layer log file for matching. This phase has been tested with our university intranet web server's log file. We have tested successfully the SQL injection for unauthorized access. We proposed a 'Query based projected clustering' for unsupervised anomaly detection and also a 'packet arrival factor' for intrusion detection in the second phase. We tested the scheme in this phase using KDD CUP99. In this phase while testing our scheme, we have extracted the feature dataset with protocol 'tcp' and services 'http'. Both the phases of our scheme found working successfully and an evaluated threshold has been proposed for better result.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809172","Web intrusion;attack labeling;query based projected clustering;sql injection;web layer log matching","Databases;Feature extraction;HTML;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Testing;Web and internet services;Web server;World Wide Web","Internet;SQL;Web sites;hypermedia markup languages;pattern clustering;security of data","'packet arrival factor';HTML;Internet services;KDD CUP99;PHP;SQL;WWW site;Web based attacks;Web intrusion detection mechanism;Web layer log file;attack rules;data clustering;data retrieving;e-business operation;hamming edit distance;misuse detection;query based projected clustering;script languages;unauthorized access","","1","","6","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect and confine malicious Javascript in PDF with minor performance overhead.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903571","Malcode bearing PDF;document instrumentation;malicious Javascript;malware detection and confinement","Context;Feature extraction;Instruments;Malware;Monitoring;Portable document format;Runtime","Java;document handling;feature extraction;invasive software;ubiquitous computing","Javascript execution;Javascript support;PDF;context monitoring code;context-aware approach;document format;document instrumentation;embedded malware;emerging threat vector;evasion attempt;malicious Javascript confinement;malicious Javascript detection;malicious document identification;online protection system;potential infection attempt detection;runtime feature;runtime monitoring;security analysis;sophisticated adversaries;static feature extraction","","0","","47","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this integration is associated with magnified risk and compromise from cyber attacks. Potential cyber attacks could be from an external source where a node is accessed by a malicious intruder using NEC, or internal to the vehicle such as a passive attack waiting to be triggered by an event. This paper provides an understanding of applying survivable systems principles of preventive and reactive mechanisms to the vehicle's integrated vetronics in order to mitigate internal and external threats.

The quality of features directly affects the performance of classification. Many feature selection methods introduced to remove redundant and irrelevant features, because raw features may reduce accuracy or robustness of classification. In this paper we compared three methods for feature selection based on Decision trees (DT), Flexible Neural Tree (FNT) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

In this paper, we introduce a randomization method to defend against these DoS attacks from the system-design perspective. We inject a certain degree of randomization into the Radio Resource Management (RRM) and Mobility Management (MM) procedure, so the parameters which are important to the attacks would be difficult to measure and the values measured would be much higher. Our simulation shows that the amount of signaling messages on the attack is decreased by 90% and the adverse impact to performance is just less than 10%.

Nodes may lose power, crash, or simply move out of range of other nodes in the network. Identifying the root cause is complicated by a lack of fixed monitoring and analysis infrastructure. Past research has focused on monitoring using either ping, heartbeat, or gossip-based approaches, which can incur significant network wide overhead. This paper proposes a novel k-hop cluster based data dissemination scheme that can piggyback on routing messages for more efficient detection of failures including node disconnection. In this scheme, nodes forward their neighbour-hood observations to a per-cluster failure detector based on the observed spanning tree. Simulations show that detecting disconnected nodes using a cross-layer implementation of the data dissemination scheme is more efficient while an application layer implementation is faster. This effect is more pronounced in sparse networks.","","978-1-4577-1588-4","978-3-901882-44-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104019","MANET;cross-layer;data dissemination;failure detection;network efficiency","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Detectors;Heart beat;Mobile computing;Protocols;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","MANET;cross-layer cluster-based data dissemination;failure detection;k-hop cluster;neighbour-hood observation;node disconnection;node failure;routing message;spanning tree;sparse network","","0","","16","","","24-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a flow based system to detect anomalous activity by using IP flow characteristics with chi-square detection mechanism. This system provides solution to identify anomalous activities like scan and flood attack by means of automatic behavior analysis of the network traffic and also give detailed information of attacker, victim, type and time of the attack which can be used for corresponding defense. Anomaly Detection capability of the proposed system is compared with SNORT Intrusion detection system and results prove the very high detection rate of the system over SNORT for different scan and flood attack. The proposed system detects different stealth scan and malformed packets scan. Since the probability of using stealth scan in real attack is very high, this system can identify the real attacks in the initial stage itself and preventive action can be taken.","","978-1-4244-4790-9","978-1-4244-4791-6","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5422996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422996","Anomaly detection;chi-square;flow;scan detection","Computer networks;Floods;High-speed networks;IP networks;Information analysis;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","IDS;IPS;SNORT intrusion detection system;automatic behavior analysis;chi-square technique;firewall;flow based anomaly detection system;intrusion detection;malicious traffic;network traffic;security mechanisms","","0","","22","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the suffering problem of these systems is that a large amount of non-critical alarms will be generated during the detection process which increase the analysis burden and lower the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems in real deployment. We argue that this bottleneck stems primarily from the lack of information related to the actual settings. To mitigate this limitation, we advocate that the way of combining intrusion detection signatures with contextual information is a promising and effective solution. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the construction of contextual signatures in intrusion detection systems by means of hash function to identify and filter out non-critical alarms. Moreover, we indicate that our scheme is compatible to different representations of intrusion detection signatures.

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152μ seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain. Using the Mahalanobis distance as the decision metric, a threshold is computed to satisfy the false alarm constraint.","","","","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133634","","Frequency-domain analysis;Gaussian distribution;Noise;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Sensor fusion;Time series analysis","frequency-domain analysis;infrared detectors;probability;safety systems;security of data;sensor fusion;signal detection;statistics","Mahalanobis distance;PIR sensor;background noise statistics;false alarm probability constraint;frequency domain analysis;intrusion detection;multiple passive infrared sensor;sensor fusion algorithm","","1","","14","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the incident investigation, Intelligence gathering is the first phase of such attacks. To evade detection, hacker may make use of botnet, a set of zombie machines, to gain the access of a target and the zombies send the collected results back to the hacker. Even though the zombies would be blocked by detection system, the hacker, using the access information obtained from the botnet, would login the target from another machine without being noticed by the detection system. Such information gathering tactic can evade detection and the hacker grants the initial access to the target. The proposed defense system analyzes multiple logs from the network and extracts the reconnaissance attack sequences related to targeted attacks. State-based model is adopted to model the steps of the above early phase attack performed by multiple scouts and an intruder and such attack events in a long time frame becomes significant in the state-aware model.

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763","978-1-4244-4498-4","978-1-4244-4499-1","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns. Finally the experimental results show that this approach is feasible.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945304","alert correlation;attack scenario;causal knowledge;data mining","Correlation;Cyberspace;Data mining;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Markov processes;Sensors","Markov processes;data mining;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","APT detection;CEP;Markov property;advanced persistent threat detection;alert correlation analysis;attack scenarios;causal knowledge discovery;complex event processing;cyberspace security situation awareness;data mining;multistep attack processes;one step transition probability matrix;raw alert stream","","0","","21","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rate.

A K-MEANS algorithm based on information entropy (KMIE) is proposed to detect anomaly activities. KMIE can filter the outliers on the dataset to reduce the negative impact, and indentify the initial cluster centers using entropy method. Then, KMIE can use these centers to iterative calculate and classify records into different clusters. This paper uses KDD CUP 1999 dataset to test the performance of KMIE algorithm. The results show that our method has a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate, it achieves expectant aim.","","978-1-4673-3093-0","","10.1109/MINES.2012.169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405632","Anomaly Detection;Clustering Analysis;Information Entropy;K-MEANS","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Information entropy;Intrusion detection","entropy;security of data","KMIE algorithm;anomalous sample;anomaly activity detection;anomaly detection rate;false alarm rate;information entropy method;intrusion detection system;semisupervised;unlabeled training data;unsupervised K-MEANS algorithm;unsupervised anomaly detection","","0","","7","","","2-4 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of ldquoUser Contributed Designsrdquo at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ldquoopen-source hardwarerdquo platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming-and more error prone-than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository.","","978-1-4244-4407-6","978-1-4244-4406-9","10.1109/MSE.2009.5270838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270838","","Acoustic testing;Education;Ethernet networks;Internet;Open source hardware;Open source software;Process design;Software design;Software standards;Solids","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;open systems;user centred design","NetFPGA platform;NetFPGA repository;NetFPGA.org;developer-community;integrated testing;networking systems;open-source hardware platform;reusable modules;reusable network hardware design;software oriented open-source projects;user contributed designs","","0","","7","","","25-27 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regrettably, current solutions are far from perfect, since they either produce a large number of false positives or they can only detect already known attacks. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving IDS performance, i.e. achieving high detection while reducing false positives. In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level. We present an ontology-based approach to correlation, and describe how it can be implemented as a distributed, highly scalable system.

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","2","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper first gives an introduction to the basic concept of intrusion detection and the basic principle of the classifier based on support vector machine, then discusses algorithm of support vector machine, and finally forms network intrusion detection system combining anomaly intrusion detection and misuse intrusion detection, based on support vector machine.","","978-1-4244-4638-4","978-1-4244-4639-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5304051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5304051","","Data security;Electronic mail;Engines;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Operating systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","security of data;support vector machines","anomaly intrusion detection system;misuse intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection;network security;support vector machine","","12","","7","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This proliferation, in combination with the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods. Fuzzy-based systems accommodate the imprecision associated with mutated and previously unidentified attack modes. This paper presents an evolutionary-fuzzy approach to intrusion detection that is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to other evolutionary approaches. In addition, the method demonstrates improved robustness in comparison to other evolutionary-based techniques.","","978-1-4244-7859-0","978-1-4244-7857-6","10.1109/NAFIPS.2010.5548289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548289","evolutionary computation;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithms;network intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Uncertainty","Internet;computer network security;evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;optimisation","Internet;computer network;evolutionary based system;evolutionary optimization;fuzzy rule based network intrusion detection system;malicious agent;mobile network","","1","","18","","","12-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthering research in this direction, we have been exploring the use of soft computing techniques to analyze intrusion data in order to detect intrusive behavior in network access patters. In this paper, we have carried out some experiments using techniques such as Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), back propagation, and J48 on the NSL-KDD intrusion data set in order to evaluate the performance of each of the techniques.

How is it possible to assess the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) ability to meet corporate security requirements? Can one monitor and enforce the agreed cloud security levels? Unfortunately, no comprehensive solutions exist for these issues. In this context, we introduce a new approach, named SPECS. It aims to offer mechanisms to specify cloud security requirements and to assess the security features offered by CSPs, and to integrate the desired security services (e.g., credential and access management) into cloud services with a Security-as-a-Service approach. Furthermore, SPECS intends to provide systematic approaches to negotiate, to monitor and to enforce the security parameters specified in Service Level Agreements (SLA), to develop and to deploy security services that are cloud SLA-aware and are implemented as an open-source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

We show how an intrusion detection system can recognize the plans of the intruder by modeling the domain as a logic program and then reducing the plan recognition problem to computing models of the logic program. This methodology has been used widely for several planning problems and fits very naturally for plan recognition problems. We give an example scenario and show how to model it.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generated by exploiting these vulnerabilities have performance impact on both victim as well as on other hosts sharing the communication path. Hence in order to protect the computational and bandwidth resources of the shared path, the anomalies caused by these attacks are to be detected and the attack traffic should be filtered out from the network elements. Under the context of flow state maintenance not deployed in the network elements, the bandwidth characterization of the attack traffic is essential to deploy the filtering rules in the equipments. In this work we have considered the network bandwidth characterization of a highly critical DDoS attack in the network: the distributed reflector attack through spoofed IPv6 flows. The generated spoofed IPv6 traffic from the attacker (slaves), the reflector attack traffic caused by the responses from the reflector and the victim, and the end-to-end path bandwidth characteristics of these flows over a 6 to 4 tunnel are reported in terms of flow rates and per flow packet count. The flow rate pattern of the spoofed flows is modeled at the attacker side using inter departure time and packet size. The impact of network scale factor on the flow rate pattern over the path is studied and reported. We also have quantified the reflector attack flow rate in the presence of the scale factor and multiple spoofed flow sources.","0742-1303","978-1-61284-926-3","","10.1109/LCN.2011.6115573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6115573","","Bandwidth;Estimation;Generators;Level measurement;Servers;Size measurement;Time measurement","IP networks;next generation networks;protocols;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;IPv6 based reflector attacks;IPv6 communication protocol;distributed denial of service;flow state maintenance;next generation networks;path behavior characteristics;security threats","","0","","13","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the inherent nature of PCM technology does not align perfectly with either applications in terms of cost-per-bit, performance, power, endurance or retention. The missing killer applications for PCM have slowed down the technology development from becoming mainstream. From the systems perspective, the ever-growing big data problems call for a paradigm shift from traditional compute-centric system to data-centric system for better performance, efficiency and productivity. A data-centric system will demand new hardware features to support the efficient storage and manipulation of data in a wide range of data-intensive applications. Considering these factors, this paper will give an overview of recent research efforts to enable PCM for building a reliable and efficient ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). By leveraging multiple levels of computing stack - technology, circuit and architecture, we will show a holistic approach of tailoring PCM to meeting the new system requirements.

On the one hand, the PHEV owner needs to charge its PHEV through the grid, given possibly time-varying electricity pricing schemes. On the other hand, the energy stored in a PHEV can also be sold back to the grid so as to act as an ancillary service while possibly generating revenues to its owner. Consequently, this motivates the need to develop smart charging policies that enable the PHEV owner to optimally decide on when to charge or discharge its vehicle, while minimizing its long-term energy consumption cost. In this paper, we model this PHEV energy management problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved by using a linear programming (LP) technique so as to obtain the optimal charging policy. In particular, we devise optimal charging policies that are resilient to the price information attacks such as denial of service (DoS) attacks and price manipulation attacks over the grid's communication network. We show that, under potential price information attacks, each PHEV can optimize its charging policies given only an estimated price information, which leads to a discrepancy between the real and expected costs. To this end, we analyze this cost difference using the proposed MDP model, which can also guide the system designer and administrator to decide whether reinforcing the system's security is required. The simulation results show that the proposed PHEV charging policy is effective and is adaptable to different PHEV mobility patterns, battery levels and varying electricity prices. It is also demonstrated that improving the system's ability to detect and resolve the attack can obviously reduce the impact brought by the attacks.","","978-1-4673-0910-3","978-1-4673-0909-7","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486015","","Batteries;Discharges (electric);Electricity;Energy consumption;Positron emission tomography;Pricing;Roads","Markov processes;battery powered vehicles;energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles;linear programming;power engineering computing;pricing;smart power grids","DoS attacks;G2V communications;LP technique;MDP;Markov decision process;V2G communications;administrator;ancillary service;battery levels;bidirectional energy flow;denial of service attacks;energy management problem;grid communication network;grid-to-vehicle communications;linear programming technique;long-term energy consumption cost minimization;mobility patterns;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;power grids;price information attacks;price manipulation attacks;resilient PHEV charging policies;smart charging policies;smart grid;system designer;system security;time-varying electricity pricing schemes;vehicle-to-grid communications","","3","","11","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As Smartphone usage has been continuously increasing in recent years, but due to its complexity and functionality, they are also vulnerable to the attacks such as virus, Trojans and worms. The smart phones have limited storage, processing and computational power to execute highly complex algorithms for intrusion detection and implementing signature based attack detection. In this paper, we propose a cloud based intrusion detection and recovery system for Android smart mobile phones that provides continuous in-depth forensic analysis to detect any misbehaviour in network. The mechanism performs analysis on the virtualized and synchronized replica of an actual device in the cloud environment. The analysis on the emulated device includes running multiple detection engines in parallel, memory scanners and system call anomaly detection that generate responses in event of attack. The responses are instructs to mobile agent installed on the device to take essential actions and perform recovery of device if needed.","","978-1-4673-2756-5","","10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450572","Android Smartphone;Cloud Computing;Intrusion Detection","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Smart phones","cloud computing;computer viruses;digital forensics;digital signatures;mobile agents;mobile computing;smart phones","Android smart mobile phones;Trojan;cloud based intrusion recovery system;cloud computing;cloud-based intrusion detection system;continuous in-depth forensic analysis;local information resource need elimination;memory scanners;mobile agent;multiple detection engines;signature based attack detection;system call anomaly detection;virus;worms","","2","","17","","","21-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although true random sequences have the character of unprediction, they still have problems on big deviation and correlation. The problem on how to get rid of these factors affecting security and obtain good randomicity is becoming the research focus. In this paper, the theory of wavelet analysis is applied to improve the qualities of true random sequences. The emulation results prove that the method used is effective in obtaining unpredictable and unrepeated random sequences.","","978-1-4673-0721-5","","10.1109/CSSS.2012.294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394532","True Random Sequences;Wavelet;correlation;deviation;security","Correlation;Noise;Random sequences;Time frequency analysis;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","correlation methods;cryptography;random sequences;wavelet transforms","correlation problems;quality improvement method;randomicity;security;true random sequences;unpredictable random sequence;unrepeated random sequence;wavelet analysis","","0","","7","","","11-13 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the current cloud security technologies do not provide early warnings about such attacks. The early warnings give the cloud administrator or the auto response controller ample time to take preventive measures. This paper discusses our three prediction models that are integrated to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF) namely, The Finite State Hidden Markov prediction model (FSHMPM), The Finite Context Prediction Model (FCPM) that uses a Variable Order Markov Model (VMM) with a Probabilistic Suffix Tree (PST), and HoltWinter Prediction Model (HWPM). We compare these models and highlight the pros and cons of each one. The prediction models were evaluated against DARPA 2000 dataset. The FSHMPM has successfully fired the early warnings 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. The FCPM has successfully fired the early warnings 58.98 minutes before the launching of the same attack. The HWPM has an error rate of 42.07% for HTTP flow forecast and 44.02% for FTP one.","","978-1-4799-7599-0","","10.1109/AIMS.2014.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7102472","Cloud computing; intrusion prediction; multi-staged attacks; HMM; VMM; Probability Suffix Tree; HoltWinter","Biological system modeling;Context;Context modeling;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","cloud computing;computer crime;finite state machines;hidden Markov models","ACIDF;FCPM;FSHMPM;HTTP flow forecast;HWPM;HoltWinter prediction model;LLDDoS1.0 attack;PST;VMM;attack prediction models;auto response controller;autonomic cloud intrusion detection framework;cloud administrator;cloud intrusion detection systems;cloud security technologies;cloud-computing systems;early warnings;economic benefits;finite context prediction model;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;functional benefits;preventive measures;probabilistic suffix tree;variable order Markov model","","0","","21","","","18-20 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyzed the attackers and system administrators' different strategies, and then constructed the dual-benefit matrix of the attackers and defenders. On the basis of this, the two-matrix network security game model was proposed. At last, the optimal defense strategy decision-making algorithm was proposed. Using this algorithm, we could analyze benefits of both offensive and defensive, and solved the Nash Equilibrium Point which balanced the both and gave the optimal response decision-making strategy. The proposed method could make accurate response decision and had a high efficiency. Also, it occupied a lower memory which could reduce the interference to normal user when administrators manage the network.","","978-1-4577-0369-0","","10.1109/ISCRAM.2011.6184094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184094","Network security;Response decision-making;Security analysis;Two-matrix game model","Fires;Games;Indexes;Markov processes","computer network management;computer network security;decision making;game theory;graph theory","Nash equilibrium point;attackers;defenders;dual-benefit matrix;game strategy graph;network management;optimal defense strategy decision-making algorithm;optimal network security response decision-making strategy;two-matrix network system security game model","","0","","20","","","25-27 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To better defend these PoIs, the design of the bistatic radar network is investigated in two stages. First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889","Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game","Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors","","","","0","","21","","2013-01-22","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This has been manifested as an every increasing range of new protocols, new encryption algorithms, new methods of authentication, smarter firewalls and intrusion detection techniques, new anti-malware products and many more. During the same period of time increasing demands for more trustworthy network infrastructure have seen the development of sophisticated analysis tools necessary to meet the operational requirements of law enforcement agencies. These include tools for e-discovery, commercial intelligence and national security. Thus the industry has seen equally significant developments in computer forensic tools where methods of searching for and detection of, malicious activity for presentation as evidence and provision of trust have become ever more sophisticated. To a considerable degree the science of security and forensics have seen both rapid but separate developments. This paper proposes that there are areas in common between these two important fields of endeavour and sets out techniques and ideas which demonstrate how they can overlap and work together in order to provide improved security and trustworthiness in critical infrastructures. In particular this paper addresses computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective such that security events can be monitored in a live network while sound forensic data collection, storage and processing can be carried out in a manner which supports real-time security and at the same time still meeting the requirements of sound evidence.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593243","","Computer architecture;Computers;Fires;Forensics;Monitoring;Real time systems;Security","computer forensics;computer network security;government data processing;national security","computer forensic tools;computer security;critical infrastructure protection;e-discovery;intrusion detection techniques;law enforcement agencies;malicious activity detection;national security;network forensics;trustworthy network infrastructure","","2","","12","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
