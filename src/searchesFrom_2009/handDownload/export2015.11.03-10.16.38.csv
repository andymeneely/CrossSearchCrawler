Besides the increasing data rate, the advent of programmable networks necessitates efficient solutions for supporting packet processing tasks in an adaptive way. Introducing a modification of a protocol or any new protocol in such a flexible infrastructure implies a novel management approach incorporating network monitoring equipment with reconfigurable architecture. The requirement for high throughput and high level of reconfiguration together put Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology into the focus of high performance networking. In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture. The system consists of two main building blocks: a high performance FPGA-based custom hardware platform and a firmware dedicated for network monitoring. We present the architecture focusing on the system-level integration of specific packet processors. The integration of processing building blocks into one high performance system has great challenges. These are primarily related to specific, limiting factors of system resources - which we discuss also in this paper.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140417","100 Gbit/s Ethernet;Field Programmable Gate Array;network management;network monitoring;reconfigurable hardware;traffic analysis","Computer architecture;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Monitoring;Protocols;Synchronization","computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;field programmable gate arrays;firmware;packet switching;parallel architectures;protocols;reconfigurable architectures","C-GEP;FPGA-based custom hardware platform;adaptive network management;field programmable gate array;firmware;high performance networking;multipurpose network;network monitoring equipment;packet processing;programmable networks;protocol;reconfigurable architecture;reconfigurable hardware;specific packet processor;system level integration","","1","","19","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Few methods consider to normalize the attributes but the question of which normalization method is more effective still remains. In this paper, we introduce four different schemes of attribute normalization to preprocess the data for anomaly intrusion detection. Three methods, k-NN, PCA as well as SVM, are then employed on the normalized data for comparison of the detection results. KDD Cup 1999 data are used to evaluate the normalization schemes and the detection methods. The systematical evaluation results show that the process of attribute normalization improves a lot the detection performance.

The purpose of the study is to design a filter such that the resulting filtering error system is stochastically finite-time bounded, and a prescribed energy-to-peak performance level is achieved over a finite time interval. By using the mode-dependent diagonally dominant Lyapunov function approach, some strict linear matrix inequality-based conditions are established for the existence of an admissible filter, and a corresponding explicit parameterisation of such a filter is obtained.

The accuracy of traditional static methods of correlation is however limited in large-scale complex systems, where the degree of human insight and validation necessary is higher, and dynamic attack behaviours are likely. Many recent efforts have centred around visualising security data in a way that can better involve and support a human analyst in the network security triage process but this potentially gives rise to another complex system of analytical and visual components which need to be configured, trained and understood. This paper describes an agent-based framework designed to manage a set of visual analytic components in order to improve a security analyst's understanding and ability to classify the threats to the network that they govern. In the proof-of-concept system an agent selects the most effective method for event aggregation, given a particular set of events which have been generated by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). We present a novel application of a dynamic response model in order to configure the aggregation component such that the data is best simplified for more effective further analysis.","","978-1-4673-2624-7","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384968","Agent-based;Alert Correlation;Intrusion Alert Analysis","Correlation;Data mining;Data visualization;Educational institutions;Security;Visual analytics","multi-agent systems;security of data","IDS;analytical components;intrusion alert analysis;intrusion detection system;network intrusion;security data;static methods;visual analytic agent based framework;visual components","","0","","23","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Successful attacks have lead to some organizations experiencing financial difficulties or even being forced out of business. Organizations have insufficient tools to detect and respond to attacks on web applications, since traditional security logs have gaps that make attack reconstruction nearly impossible.

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2906-4","","10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466310","Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;Neuro-fuzzy;Radial Support Vector Machine","","Internet;data mining;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","BPNN;Columbia model;IDS building;Internet;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;SVM classifier;business Web application;data mining technique;decision tree;detection accuracy;financial Web application;fuzzy neural network;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection technique;k-means clustering;network security;neuro-fuzzy model;radial SVM classification;radial basis support vector machine;sensitivity;specificity","","5","","23","","","4-6 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a critical part of smart grid and failure to address security risks in it might disrupt utilities in their mission to deliver power reliably. The objective of this paper is to find mitigation actions for attacks that might be launched against AMI. The paper introduces a tool called SecAMI that calculates the relationship between the speed at which an attack spreads, the speed at which it can be detected, and the consequences on the availability of the AMI. The results from SecAMI can be used as a performance metric to significantly improve the development and the deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in an AMI environment. Experimental results with an IDS called Amilyzer show that centralized IDS might not work efficiently in scalable systems comparing with distributed IDS in term of detection time, especially with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack or remote disconnects on the AMI.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007777","","Availability;Conferences;Network topology;Smart grids;Smart meters;Time factors;Timing","computer network security;power engineering computing;power system measurement;risk management;smart power grids","Amilyzer;CPS applications;DDoS attack;IDS;SecAMI;advanced metering infrastructure;cyber technology;cyber-physical systems;distributed denial of service;intrusion detection systems;risk assessment tool;security risks;smart grid","","0","","11","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But it also induces new security risks to existing and future systems. Intrusion detection is a key technology for security protection. However, traditional intrusion detection systems for the IT domain are not entirely suitable for industrial process automation. In this paper, multiple models are constructed by comprehensively analyzing the multidomain knowledge of field control layers in industrial process automation, with consideration of two aspects: physics and information. And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed. Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of anomaly detection, a classifier based on an intelligent hidden Markov model, is designed to differentiate the actual attacks from faults. Finally, based on a combination simulation platform using optimized performance network engineering tool, the detection accuracy and the real-time performance of the proposed intrusion detection system are analyzed in detail. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed system has good performance in terms of high precision and good real-time capability.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2415763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081762","Anomaly intrusion detection;hidden Markov model (HMM);industrial process automation;multimodel;security","Automation;Control systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Process control;Protocols","control engineering computing;data protection;digital simulation;hidden Markov models;optimisation;pattern classification;process control;security of data","PCS;anomaly intrusion detection system;classifier design;combination simulation platform;field control system;hidden Markov model;industrial process automation;intelligent detection algorithm;multidomain knowledge;performance network engineering tool optimization;process control system;security protection;security risk","","0","","50","","2015-04-08","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes.

For high dimensional data, feature selection can find the information-rich feature subset, thus enhance the classification accuracy and efficiency. Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy). The experimental results demonstrated that our approach can find features subsets with higher classification accuracy compared with feature selection algorithm based on information gain and GA.","","978-1-4244-6325-1","978-1-4244-6326-8","10.1109/ISISE.2009.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447161","IDS;feature selection;information gai;svm","Ad hoc networks;Artificial neural networks;Costs;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;redundancy;security of data;set theory;support vector machines","GA;SVM algorithm;ad hoc network;bad detection rate;classification accuracy;computational efficiency;computing resources;data intrusion detection processing system;feature redundancy removal approach;feature selection algorithm;high detection accuracy;information gain;information-rich feature subset;long training time;secure information systems;support vector machine","","0","","15","","","26-28 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Empirical studies show that as the rule set grows larger, power consumption and delay time for processing IP Packets particularly on Hardware firewalls increases extremely, and, therefore the performance of the firewall decreases proportionally. This paper present a new FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) based firewall with high performance, high processing speed, low power consumption, and low space utilization in contrast with early submitted paper in some of credible international conferences. First of all, we use Embedded Memories of FPGA instead of external memories, to increase the processing speed and to decrease the mass of signaling and noise creation in connection between FPGA and external memories. Moreover, we have applied pipeline technique to the architecture, and so we achieved high processing speed in addition to low power consumption. Based on this model, only the security rules are updated by admin during the configuration process while other hardware part would remain unchanged. The proposed architecture is written in VHDL standard language and it is simulated and synthesized with ALTERA QUARTUS II software. Finally, for validation of proposed architecture, we implemented the synthesized code on 3 of ALTERA FPGAs families (STRATIX III, CYCLONE III, CYCLONE II), and then results have been compared with earlier results.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678545","","Fires;Hardware;Pipelines;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Registers;Synchronization","IP networks;authorisation;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","ALTERA QUARTUS II software;FPGA;IP packet;SOC;VHDL;configuration process;field programmable gate array;hardware firewall implementation;pipeline technique;power consumption","","0","","17","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we analyze the SIP protocol and show that it can easily be exploited to mount effective and large-scale botnets. We do this by scrutinizing the details of the SIP protocol and show how it offers a variety of ways to conceal botnet traffic within legitimate-looking SIP traffic. Using our analysis, we implement a SIP bot and present experimental results from a real testbed network. In addition, we employ traffic statistics collected from a large telecommunication provider and discuss the implications for both botnet design and detection.

This type of computation falls under the category of Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). The solution to SMC problems in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) can be found with the modification of the data inputs or with some anonymization technique. MANETs are the wireless networks of the mobile computing devices with no support of any fixed infrastructure. The mobile nodes use any of the radio technology like Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 or Hiperlan for directly communicating with each other. The nodes behave as hosts as well as routers. The security challenges in the MANET arise due to its dynamic topology, vulnerable wireless link and nomadic environment. An identification mechanism is needed between the nodes using identification and the credentials. This security architecture simultaneously leads to privacy problems. Some mechanism is needed which prevents a node to learn the identity or the credentials of other nodes. To provide location privacy in MANET is a nontrivial task. Current routing protocols do not focus much on the security and the privacy issues. These aspects are postponed till further development. An authentication protocol is needed between nodes using some cryptographic technique. In service-oriented MANET the denial of the service must be taken care of so that the availability of the service is maintained. The security requirement of the ad hoc network depends on its application. For example, for a simple business meeting the requirement is mitigated and for the military battlefield it is severe. Thus no general security architecture can be developed for MANET. Specific security architecture is needed for specific application. Much security related work is still pending and will add to the standards as the physical deployment of the MANET will grow. In this paper, an empha- - sis is made on how SMC solutions can be used for privacy preservation during computation.","","978-1-4244-7203-1","","10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587317","MANET;Privacy;Secure Multiparty Computation;Security","Ad hoc networks;Aggregates;Computational modeling;Irrigation;Mobile computing;Presses;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols","MANET;SMC;authentication protocol;cryptographic technique;distributed computing device;mobile ad hoc network;mobile computing devices;privacy preservation;secure multiparty computation;security architecture;wireless network","","5","","16","","","6-8 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Countering Network-Centric Insider Threats through Self-Protective Autonomic Rule Generation","Sibai, Faisal M.; Menasce, D.","","Software Security and Reliability (SERE), 2012 IEEE Sixth International Conference on","20120806","2012","","","273","282","Insider threats are a growing problem in today's organizations. Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","0","","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These rules can latter be effectively applied to network anomaly detection in the LAN. This paper discusses the method of using association rules mining in anomaly detection of LAN, and analyzes its working principle. We give a detailed discussion on several steps, including the method of data acquisition and preprocessing, association rules mining, the usage of similarity to determine whether the network behavior conform to the extracted association rules and the detection of anomalous behaviors.

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"". To do so, we will take the language which is realized by Jonathan Rouzauld Cornabas to modelize the system's entities to protect. This paper represents only the idea on which we will base on, in order to design an effective IDS in the operating system running in user space.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237318","intrusion detection system;realtime system;security;security properties","Access control;Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","cryptography;firewalls;information systems;operating systems (computers)","IDS;anomaly approach;cryptography;firewalls;information assurance;information systems;intrusion detection system;misuse approach;operating system;security properties","","0","","","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most important features of security devices such as IDSs, AVSs and D-MASs, is how accurately they identify and document threats. By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists. In this paper, we lay out the basis of D-MASs accuracy assessment and we present an evaluation of eight of these systems. We propose test coverage criteria, oracle types and specifications to assess the accuracy of D-MASs.

The experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed new model significantly improves the detection of flood attacks and provides a better understanding of the nature of flood attacks on networks.","","","","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831926","Network security;flood attack pattern;information visualization;receiving density;sending density","Computer hacking;Floods;Internet;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic;Visualization","Internet;computer network security;data visualisation;graph theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication traffic","Internet;attacks patterns;clustering visualization graph;density-pattern based approach;early detection;flood attack detection;intrusion detection system;network traffic analysis;receiving-density coefficients;sending-density coefficients;two-density model;visual analysis","","0","","22","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the base of this, a way to enhance the correct rate of the detection by joint detection mechanism of multi-point cooperation has been introduced in this paper. To distribute the network resource dynamically and reasonably, all nodes are treated dynamically with safety classification.

Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as correlated information and the data set is defined as correlated data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a correlated data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the correlated data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in correlated data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective correlated differential privacy solution by defining the correlated sensitivity and designing a correlated data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the correlated levels between records, the proposed correlated sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The correlated data releasing mechanism correlated iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed correlated differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a correlated data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the correlated differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2368363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949097","Correlated Dataset;Differential Privacy;Non-IID Dataset;Privacy Preserving;Privacy preserving;correlated dataset;differential privacy;non-IID dataset","Correlation;Couplings;Data privacy;Histograms;Noise;Privacy;Sensitivity","data encapsulation;data mining;data privacy;iterative methods","correlated data releasing mechanism;correlated data set;correlated differential privacy solution;correlated information;correlated iteration mechanism;correlated levels;correlated sensitivity;data mining;data release;influential privacy notion;information hiding;iterative method;non-IID data set;privacy guarantee;privacy preserving;privacy violation;traditional global sensitivity","","0","","17","","2014-11-06","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In other words, IDS function is limited to detection as well as response. The IDS is unable to capture the state of the system when an intrusion is detected. Hence, it fails to preserve the evidences against the attack in original form. To maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later examination, new security strategy is very much needed.

Our MCA-based DoS attack detection system employs the principle of anomaly based detection in attack recognition. This makes our solution capable of detecting known and unknown DoS attacks effectively by learning the patterns of legitimate network traffic only. Furthermore, a triangle-area-based technique is proposed to enhance and to speed up the process of MCA.

This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by ""licit"" and ""illicit"" network applications.

This moves automation networks from outdated, proprietary, closed networks to the more current arena of Information Technology (IT). However, while gaining all of the cost and performance benefits of IT, existing IT security challenges are acquired as well. The power grid automation network has inherent security risks due to the fact that the systems and applications in the network were not originally designed for the general IT environment. In this paper, we propose a conceptual layered framework for protecting power grid automation systems against cyber attacks. The following factors are taken into account: 1) integration with existing, legacy systems in a non-intrusive fashion; 2) desirable performance in terms of modularity, scalability, extendibility, and manageability; 3) alignment to the Â¿Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy SectorÂ¿ and the future intelligent power delivery systems.

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. This gives the system administrator or an autonomic controller ample time to take preventive measures.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073270","Autonomic response;HMM;Intrusion prevention;cloud computing;early warning;intrusion prediction;online risk assessment","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Risk management;Security;Vectors","cloud computing;hidden Markov models;probability;risk management;security of data;virtualisation","ACIDF;LLDDoS1.0 attack;adaptive risk metric;autonomic cloud intrusion detection framework;autonomic cloud intrusion prevention systems;autonomic prevention actions;cloud infrastructure;early warnings;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;occurrence probability;online risk assessment model;prediction system;preventive measures;proactive corrective actions;risk measure;security technologies;virtualization","","0","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It does not require installation of any additional hardware and extra communication costs; its computational requirements are negligible. The proposed technique ma be used in both hierarchical and flat WSNs. The paper contains recommendations to the choice of threshold value for each traffic parameter.

A botnet is a group of Internet-connected computer programs communicating with other similar programs in order to perform various attacks. HTTP-based botnet is most dangerous botnet among all the different botnets available today. In botnets detection, in particularly, behavioural-based approaches suffer from the unavailability of the benchmark datasets and this lead to lack of precise results evaluation of botnet detection systems, comparison, and deployment which originates from the deficiency of adequate datasets. Most of the datasets in the botnet field are from local environment and cannot be used in the large scale due to privacy problems and do not reflect common trends, and also lack some statistical features. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any benchmark dataset available which is infected by HTTP-based botnet (HBB) for performing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Web servers by using HTTP-GET flooding method. In addition, there is no Web access log infected by botnet is available for researchers. Therefore, in this paper, a complete test-bed will be illustrated in order to implement a real time HTTP-based botnet for performing variety of DDoS attacks against Web servers by using HTTP-GET flooding method. In addition to this, Web access log with http bot traces are also generated. These real time datasets and Web access logs can be useful to study the behaviour of HTTP-based botnet as well as to evaluate different solutions proposed to detect HTTP-based botnet by various researchers.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779162","Botnet;Cyber attacks;DDoS attacks;HTTP flooding;HTTP-based botnet","Computer crime;Floods;Intrusion detection;Web servers","invasive software","DDoS attacks;HBB testbed;HTTP-GET flooding method;Internet-connected computer programs;Web access log;Web servers;behavioural-based approaches;botnet detection systems;cyber attacks;distributed denial of service attacks;http bot traces;malware;real time HTTP-based botnet","","1","","27","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, the inability to seamlessly burst between internal cloud and external cloud platforms, termed cloud bursting, is a significant shortcoming of current cloud solutions. Furthermore, the absence of a capability that would allow to broker between multiple cloud providers or to aggregate them into a composite service inhibits the free and open competition that would help the market mature.

However, we show that DNS-based selection of CDN servers can be refined to fully deliver on the speedup of CDNs. We propose DNS-Proxy (dp), a client-side process that shares load-balancing functionality with CDNs by choosing from among resolved CDN servers based on last mile network performance. Our measurement study of CDN infrastructure deployed by five major CDN providers shows that dp reduces webpage load time by 29% on average. If dp has already resolved the domain, the reduction in webpage load time is as much as 40%. Finally, dp reduces the load time of individual static Web objects by as much as 43%. We argue that dp enables a more effective use of existing content delivery infrastructure and represents a complementary strategy to a continual increase of geographic content availability.","","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288411","","Asia;Google;IP networks;Image resolution;North America;Servers;Time measurement","Internet;Web sites;client-server systems;resource allocation","DNS-based CDN server selection;Webpage load time reduction;client-assisted CDN server selection Website;content delivery network;load balancing;static Web object","","","","","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel architectural platform that thoroughly analyzes the network traffic behavior in terms of repetitions to identify potential Internet threats. The main idea is to use a two-phase hashing system and small memory units functioning in parallel to achieve a high-throughput and memory efficient behavioral analysis engine. The system performs behavioral analysis on selected information/user(s) and builds a bell-shaped curve for normal traffic using parallel counters. Our traffic behavioral analysis system has been fully prototyped on Altera Stratix FPGA.

In this work we propose a novel distributed node self-monitoring mechanism for wireless sensor networks. Assuming a sensor node can detect the communications (sending message) of its neighboring nodes, we design a one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, in which the selected nodes, named Monitor Nodes (MNs), can monitor their neighboring nodes. A distributed dominating set approximation algorithm is design to obtain the MN set. The cooperation among MNs guarantees all regular nodes (RNs) are monitored. However, the MNs may be compromised by external attackers and produces false alarms. To improve the one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, we design a many-to-one dynamical monitoring approach to take the MNs under surveillance. The neighboring nodes of a MN are dynamically selected to monitor their MN. In the proposed mechanism, a node produces an alert when it detects abnormal behaviors of the node under surveillance. The sink node collects the alert messages to make judgment to the potential abnormal nodes. The proposed self-monitoring mechanism can be used to detect and position multiple inter-network attacks, including selective forwarding, black-hole and DoS. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed node self-monitoring mechanism.","","978-1-4244-7616-9","","10.1109/ICISE.2010.5691634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5691634","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Manganese;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","24","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed procedure a 2D mesh topology is selected first while PCA algorithm is represented in form of a task graph, which can be divided into 2 levels. In the higher level, tasks are matrix-based algorithms, such as mean computation, which in turn will be mapped onto the NoC topology. Since the NoC is scalable, an appropriate size of 2D mesh will be selected so that the timing of each task in the task chain is matched resulting in an effective pipeline in the higher level. The simulation using SystemC with NoC modeled as Cycle-Accurate showed that an average throughput of 2.20 Gbps and latency of 0.025 cycle/flit were achieved while computing the matrix multiplication of size 112×92 with 81 Processing Element (PE) organize as 9×9 while running with clock speed of 100 MHz.","","978-1-4673-1156-4","978-1-4673-1155-7","10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6381018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381018","2D Principal Component Analysis (2D-PCA);Homogeneous Processor;Networks-on-Chip (NoC);Parallel Matrix Multiplication;System-on-Chip (SoC);SystemC","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms","matrix multiplication;network-on-chip;principal component analysis;topology","2D mesh topology;NoC topology;PCA algorithm;SystemC;hardware implementation;matrix based algorithm;matrix manipulation;matrix multiplication;mean computation;networks on chip paradigm;principal component analysis;processing element;task chain;task graph","","0","","9","","","2-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457","Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system","Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines","QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor","","8","4","27","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An organization with hundreds of workstations does not necessarily imply that it has the opportunity to form an ad-hoc computer cluster because different workstations may have different turned-on durations and these workstations may not be available at the same time depending on their users' usage. The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations.
