APT is a combination of past attacks, not a new one. It's different from any one of previous attacks. Predicting the attack path of APT exactly would be a breakthrough for the future defense in Internet of things. Firstly, the paper proposes classifications of attack and defense for game model from the perspective of game theory. Then, we present the OAPG model, which uses attack path of APT as the attacker's strategy. Finally, according to the Nash equilibrium, we compute the optimal attack path for the attacker and best-response strategies for the defender.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945739","Internet of things;attack path;game model;strategy","Buffer overflows;Computational modeling;Correlation;Games;Predictive models;Servers;Telecommunications","Internet of Things;computer network security;game theory","APT;Internet of Things;Nash equilibrium;OAPG model;advanced persistent attack;attack path prediction;game model;game theory;network security;optimal attack path","","0","","8","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to ensure high security this work focuses on multiple classifier fusion technique to increase detection rate. The primary role of classifier is to classify the correct and incorrect instance therefore multiple classifier design that is practical, and detects more attack by means of combining them is preferred here. To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done. Decision based on threshold value and combining the classifiers result based on majority voting rule helps to increase the overall efficiency and accuracy in detecting the various categories of attack.","","978-1-4799-3826-1","","10.1109/ICCPEIC.2014.6915405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915405","Fusion;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Majority Voting Rule;Multiple Classifier","","security of data;sensor fusion","detection methodologies;diversified intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;misuse based attacks;multiple classifier fusion technique;security;sensor fusion;threshold value","","0","","17","","","16-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Basically, in addition to the parameters (such as bandwidth utilization, routing information and packets timing) that are important for network tools, security tools are more sensitive to issues like traffic composition, contents, and session level parameters. Generating a realistic synthetic traffic that keeps all the characteristics of the real traffic has proved to be difficult. For this reason, security testers often use real traffic traces in their test or evaluation. However, the available traces are often limited in number or size. Therefore, it is necessary to merge and manipulate traces to create a test environment that would be representative of the operational environment, and to inject attacks into the traffic. A variety of tools for recording, replaying as well as forging packets can be obtained easily, but there exist very few tools for manipulating traces so as to modify the traffic composition from the networking viewpoint. Among them, surprisingly there is no tool for manipulating traces without destructing their security-relevant characteristics. In this paper, we present a brief survey for trace manipulation and packet forging tools. Then we determine the requirements of tools for manipulating traces and injecting attacks while keeping their original characteristics. Finally, we present the architecture, and the implementation of our tool intended to fill this lack in security testing tools.","","978-1-4244-3999-7","978-0-7695-3639-2","10.1109/WAINA.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136802","","Character generation;Communication system traffic control;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Switches;System testing;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Traffic control","IP networks;bandwidth allocation;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","TCP/IP network;attack injection;bandwidth utilization;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network traffic trace manipulation tool;network-based security testing tool;packet forging tool;packet timing;routing information","","1","","15","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main property we have considered for each behavior is the correlation between the parameters of it. We compute a correlation matrix for normal sessions in the training phase. Then we select effective security parameters for our detection engine using an equivalent class with a graphical illustration namely correlation relation graph (CRG). These extracted parameters among all parameters of each normal behavior have a relation with each other which could be computed by regression relations. Each behavior has some pairs of selected parameters including the independent parameter and the dependent one. As an inline detection process, we look at the value of selected parameters of each current session and put them into their computed regression relation. If the computed value of the dependent parameter of each pair has a value greater then what we compute by their regression relation, it will be considered as a deviation. Number of deviations per session and the combination of them is used to label a session as normal or attack. The results show that our proposed method has suitable detection rate and false alarm.","","978-1-4244-5158-6","978-1-4244-5159-3","10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339579","Anomaly Detection;Confidence Interval;Correlation Coefficient;Correlation Relation Graph;Data Correlation;Regression Relation","Computer networks;Correlation;Data engineering;Data security;Engines;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Sensor systems","graph theory;matrix algebra;regression analysis;security of data","anomaly detection systems;correlation matrix;correlation relation graph;data correlation method;inline detection process;regression relations;security parameters","","0","","15","","","14-17 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA “10. KIDS” core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6598669","Adversarial classification;anomaly detection;intrusion detection systems;secure machine learning","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","KIDS;anomaly detection systems;evasion attacks;key-recovery attacks;keyed anomaly detection system;machine learning algorithms","","0","","23","","2013-09-13","May-June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This complexity made the desire for more sophisticated tools to watch and troubleshoot network traffic. Network traffic monitoring is can be quite a network diagnostic tool that monitors local area networks and provides a graphical display of network statistics. While collecting information through the network's data stream, network monitor displays the source address of the computer that sent a frame onto the network, the destination address of the computer that received the frame and also the protocols employed to send the frame. The procedure through which network monitor collects this information is known as Capturing. Automatically, the network monitor gathers statistics on all of the frames it detects on the network into a capture buffer that is a reserved storage area in memory. To capture statistics on merely a specific subset of frames, we could discriminate these frames by designing a capture filter. To work with network monitor, the computer will need to have a network card that supports promiscuous mode. This paper targets on the usage of packet capturing library Jpcap for monitoring, analyzing and reporting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICCSA.2014.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976660","DDoS Attacks;Intrusion Detection;Jpcap;Packet Capture;Sniffer","Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Libraries;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Protocols","application program interfaces;computer network security;computerised monitoring;graphical user interfaces;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attacks;Jpcap API;capture filter;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;local area networks;network diagnostic tool;network statistic graphical display;network traffic monitoring;packet capturing library;promiscuous mode;protocols;reserved storage area","","0","","11","","","June 30 2014-July 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We construct a process expression for each function to describe its behaviour. Without constructing automata or introducing nondeterminacy, we use algebraic properties and algorithms to obtain a global process expression by combining the process expressions derived from each function.

"Protecting peer-to-peer network with roaming agents","Banik, S.M.; Urey, H.","Dept. of Math. & Comput. Sci., Citadel, Charleston, SC, USA","SoutheastCon 2015","20150625","2015","","","1","6","Peer-to-peer networks are continuously becoming more popular for sharing data and resources. However, a major drawback of this type of network is its ability to maintain security, since there is no centralized server to oversee the network. One way to remedy this problem is through the use of intelligent mobile agents. These agents will act as guards, which will essentially roam the network and periodically check on each node to ensure that it is not under attack. In our previous research, we have proposed algorithms for initial placement of agents in a given peer-to-peer network. As the agents are mobile, the next issue with agent-based security is how the agents should roam around the network to detect attacks. We want the agents to scan the entire network as quickly as possible which will minimize the detection time of attacks. If we run too many agents simultaneously to scan the network, they will consume system resources which will slow down the performance of applications running on the peer-to-peer network. In this paper we have proposed three roaming algorithms for agents. The first algorithm Heavy Scan Algorithm scans the network with minimum time by sacrificing the performance of the application. The second algorithm Light Scan Algorithm takes the maximum time to complete the scan of the entire network with less degradation of the performance of the application. The third algorithm Medium Scan Algorithm balances time to complete the scan with performance of the application. We have illustrated the proposed algorithms with an example. We have also analyzed the complexity of the proposed algorithms.","","","","10.1109/SECON.2015.7132990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7132990","agents;intrusion detection;peer-to-peer networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Delays;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer-to-peer computing","computational complexity;computer network security;mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing","agent-based security;attack detection time;centralized server;data sharing;heavy scan algorithm;intelligent mobile agents;light scan algorithm;medium scan algorithm;peer-to-peer network;resource sharing;roaming agents;roaming algorithms","","1","","9","","","9-12 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel approach to analyse and model network traffic anomalies is presented. The proposed approach individually characterises different aspects of anomalies, such as origin, termination, propagation and changes in duration and volume, with common random processes. These characteristics are then integrated into a single model that successfully captures the overall anomaly behaviours. Characterisation of each anomaly property requires only a few parameters, leading to a concise set of parameters for the entire model. Although the model is calibrated with local measurements made at nodes, it successfully represents the global behaviours of anomalies over the network. The proposed model is applicable both at nodal level and at subnet level. This enables hierarchically analysing large and sophisticated networks. Anomalies are analysed using a multi-scale analysis framework based on which, a real-time monitoring system that efficiently communicate ongoing anomaly information across the network is developed. The system is also used for learning regional model parameters distributively. Internet2 traffic data is analysed using the framework, and the corresponding model parameters are derived.

Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Thus the nodes find a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network. Since the data packets do not reach the destination node on account of this attack, data loss will occur.

To run our algorithm, the network is divided into clusters and three types of nodes called header, monitor and general node are defined in each cluster. Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Misuse detection is the most popular approach to detect intrusions, using a library of signatures to find attacks. The accuracy of the signatures is paramount for an effective IDS, still today's practitioners rely on manual techniques to improve and update those signatures. We present a system, called pSigene, for the automatic generation of intrusion signatures by mining the vast amount of public data available on attacks. It follows a four-step process to generate the signatures, by first crawling attack samples from multiple public cyber security web portals. Then, a feature set is created from existing detection signatures to model the samples, which are then grouped using a biclustering algorithm which also gives the distinctive features of each cluster. Finally the system automatically creates a set of signatures using regular expressions, one for each cluster. We tested our architecture for SQL injection attacks and found our signatures to have a True and False Positive Rates of 90.52% and 0.03%, respectively and compared our findings to other SQL injection signature sets from popular IDS and web application firewalls. Results show our system to be very competitive to existing signature sets.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903566","SQL injection;biclustering;signature generalization;web application security","Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Databases;Feature extraction;Manuals;Portals","SQL;authorisation;data mining;digital signatures;portals","IDS;SQL injection attack;SQL injection signature;Webcrawling;biclustering algorithm;crawling attack;data mining;intrusion detection system;misuse detection;pSigene;public cyber security Web portal","","0","","44","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Black hole attack is a common active and internal attack which can misdirects the routing in reactive protocols. In this paper, a solution is proposed to avoid Black hole attack in AODV. Proposed solution uses a route legitimacy value attached with RREP which ensures that the route is free from black hole node.","","978-1-4799-2053-2","","10.1109/ICOSST.2014.7029341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029341","Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector;Black hole Attack;MANET;Routing Table;Sequence number;TTL","Ad hoc networks;Maintenance engineering;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Vectors","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV-based MANET;RREP;ad hoc on-demand distance vector;black hole attack;internal attack;mobile ad hoc networks;route legitimacy value;routing protocols;wireless networks","","0","","23","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this paper is to survey the various threats facing AMIs and the common attack techniques used to realize them in order to identify and understand the requirements for a comprehensive intrusion detection solution. The threat analysis leads to an extensive “attack tree” that captures the attackers' key objectives (e.g., energy theft) and the individual attack steps (e.g., eavesdropping on the network) that would be involved in achieving them. With reference to the attack tree, we show the type of information that would be required to effectively detect attacks. We also suggest that the widest coverage in monitoring the attacks can be provided by a hybrid sensing infrastructure that uses both a centralized intrusion detection system and embedded meter sensors.","","978-1-4673-0910-3","978-1-4673-0909-7","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486016","","Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mesh networks;Monitoring;Routing;Sensors","metering;power system security;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","AMI threat analysis;advanced metering infrastructures;attack detection;attack tree;centralized intrusion detection system;common attack techniques;comprehensive intrusion detection solution;embedded meter sensors;hybrid sensing infrastructure;mesh networks;smart meters","","11","","14","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated. Furt- ermore, superior configurations can be identified and assessed without endangerment of the productive network.","2325-5366","978-1-4799-0450-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568386","comparative evaluation;intrusion detection;intrusion detection correlation;optimization;real-world evaluation;test environment","Charge coupled devices;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sensors","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IT security;IT systems;NIDS;detection capability;false alarm rates;intrusion detection systems;knowledge based systems;network traffic;periodic performance evaluation studies;real - world networks;real-productive systems;system performance;unaltered live record","","2","","29","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions.

It consists of four significant enhancements: enhanced threshold-based training, dynamic input normalization, feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation, and prediction confidence filtering and forwarding. We test the capability of the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD'99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying ""unknown"" attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates.

Thus, in a SSO based system, robust persistent authentications and secure session termination management are vital for ensuring secure operations. In this paper we propose a novel persistent authentication technique using multiplicative attribute graph model. We use multiple attribute based persistent authentication model using facial biometrics, location and activity specific information. We propose a novel membership (or group affiliations) based session management technique for user initiated SSO global logout management.

Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks.

"Implementation guidelines for a harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model","Valjarevic, A.; Venter, H.S.","Dept. of Comput.

Benefits of achieving a high level of digital forensic investigation readiness include, but are not limited to, higher admissibility of digital evidence in a court of law, better utilisation of resources (including time and financial resources) and higher awareness of forensic investigation readiness. The problem that this paper addresses is that there is no harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model with appropriate implementation guidelines and, thus, there is a lack of an effective and standardised implementation of digital forensic investigation readiness measures within organisations. Valjarevic and Venter have, in their previous work, proposed a harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model. This paper proposes implementation guidelines for such a harmonised digital forensic investigation process model in order to help practitioners and researchers to successfully implement the proposed model. The authors believe that these guidelines will significantly help to properly and consistently implement digital forensic readiness measures in different organisations in a bid to achieve higher admissibility of digital evidence in a court of law, as well as more efficient and effective digital forensic investigations.","","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641041","digital forensics;guidelines;information systems security;mode;process","Digital forensics;Guidelines;Planning;Risk management;Software","digital forensics","digital evidence;financial resources;harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model;implementation guidelines;time resources","","0","","15","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these challenges, we developed a distributed Wi-Fi sniffing program called Saluki. Compared to our previous implementation and to other available sniffing programs, Saluki has the following advantages: (1) its small footprint makes it suitable for a resource-constrained Linux platform, such as those in commercial Wi-Fi access points; (2) the frame-capture rate increased more than three-fold over tcpdump with minimal frame loss; (3) all traffic between this sniffer and the back-end server was secured using 128-bit encryption; and (4) the traffic load on the backbone network was reduced to only 30% of that in our previous implementation. In this paper, we introduce the design and the implementation details of this high-performance sniffing program, along with preliminary evaluation results.","","978-1-4244-7523-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5520341","","Buildings;Computer science;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Network servers;Passive networks;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","","","","0","","22","","","May 31 2010-June 4 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs.

A system call correlating method is proposed to identify the coherent system calls belonging to the same process from the system call sequence. We have developed a prototype of VSyscall and implemented it in two mainstream virtual machine monitors, Qemu and KVM, respectively.

Nevertheless, as shown by recent events, security studies on real SCADA systems are challenging due to the lack of proper experimentation environments. Through this work we develop a method to generate realistic network traffic in laboratory conditions without the need of a real PCS installation. This is indeed our main contribution as the basis of future anomaly detection systems. Such method could support experimentation through the recreation of realistic traffic in simulated environments.

This approach leverages the DRAMA policy based network management system and the Smart Firewall system to meet the above requirement. It allows administrators to specify low-level network access control policies for each INFOCON level using high-level policies (adapted from the Smart Firewalls approach). The high-level policies are securely distributed to all the policy decision points in the network, which evaluate and enforce policies in a distributed manner. As a consequence of enforcing policies in response to INFOCON level changes, appropriate access control policies will be derived and applied to local firewall devices without human intervention.

As the data traffic generation is based on control traffic, the behavior of the two planes is expected to be similar during normal behavior. Therefore, detecting dissimilarity (via cross-correlation) between the traffic of the two planes can indicate an abnormal behavior.

How to quickly perceive the traffic anomaly is a new demand in the network anomaly detection. Due to the shortage of the conventional detection methods in terms of speed, a fast anomaly detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which is based on the iterative estimation of Hurst parameter. The anomaly can be determined through the value of estimation. Meanwhile, by on-line we can estimate continuously and refresh the value of Hurst according to the latest network traffic, and then we can get the latest traffic data and speed up the process of anomaly detection.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.","1930-529X","978-1-4673-0920-2","978-1-4673-0919-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527","","","pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter","","0","","15","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH. Moreover, the additional storage requirement of the technique requires only 4KB additional information per connection as compared to 8KB of ACCH.","","978-1-4244-8454-6","978-1-4244-8455-3","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986030","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Huffman coding;Inspection;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;cellular radio;data compression;hypermedia;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH algorithm;DFA- based Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;SPC;Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm;compressed Web traffic;concurrent connection;content based networking device;real security device signature;shift-based pattern matching;standard GZIP;storage requirement;wireless Web device","","2","","25","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV.

Usually, the network security policy is defined as the collection of service access rules between various network zones. The specification of the security policy is often incomplete since all possible service access paths may not be explicitly covered. This policy is implemented in the network interfaces in a distributed fashion through sets of access control (ACL) rules. Formally verifying whether the distributed ACL implementation conforms to the security policy is a major requirement. The complexity of the problem is compounded as some combination of network services may lead to inconsistent hidden access paths. Further, failure of network link(s) may result in the formation of alternative routing paths and thus the existing security implementation may defy the policy. In this study, an integrated formal verification and fault analysis framework has been proposed which derives a correct ACL implementation with respect to given policy specification and also ensures that the implementation is fault tolerant to certain number of link failures. The verification incorporates boolean modelling of the security policies and ACL implementations and then formulates a satisfiability checking problem.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2009.0174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672444","","","Boolean functions;authorisation;business communication;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;formal verification;network routing;telecommunication network topology","access control rules;alternative routing paths;boolean modelling;enterprise network;fault analysis;fault tolerant;formal approach;formal verification;hidden access paths;integrated security analysis;network interfaces;network link failure;network security policy;network topology;service access rules","","3","","","","","December 2010","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

This paper focuses on the security threats faced by the web lets during their migration between the cloud and the mobile devices. Web let migration is an important task during the implementation of elasticity in the cloud. As a primary step, a secure communication channel is designed for the web let migration by deploying secure shell protocol. Herein, the vulnerabilities in some authentication mechanisms are highlighted and a better way of authenticating the web lets with SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is suggested. Finally, managing the traffic effectively in the designed channel with the aid of back pressure technique is also covered in this paper.","","978-1-4673-1986-7","","10.1109/EIDWT.2012.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354763","Authentication;Backpressure;Channel;Migration;Weblets","Authentication;Cloud computing;Communication channels;Mobile handsets;Protocols;Tunneling","cloud computing;trusted computing","SFTP;Weblets;authentication mechanisms;cloud computing;mobile devices;reduced traffic;secure file transfer protocol;securing authentication;security threats;trusted migration","","0","","14","","","19-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The interesting alerts are always mixed with irrelevant, duplicate and non interesting alerts. Huge volumes of poorly sorted and unclustered alerts frustrate the efforts of analysts when identifying the interesting alerts. Therefore, the unmanageable amount of poorly sorted alerts is a critical issue affecting the performance of IDSs. This paper proposes a better mechanism to compute the similarities of the verified alerts using the distance among the new alert features. Our approach uses the both clustering technique and Supporting Evidence (Vulnerability data) to build a robust Alert Cluster. Our goal was to reduce the unnecessary alert load and improve the quality of alerts sent to the analysts. We can confidently state that our approach significantly reduced the unnecessary alert loads and improved the quality of alerts.","","978-1-4244-5537-9","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563925","Alert Clustering;Alert Reduction;Data Mining;Supporting Evidence;Vulnerability data","Computers;Logic gates","pattern clustering;security of data","IDS alert;alert cluster;intrusion detection system;supporting evidence","","1","","16","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system consists of base-station with laser source and sensor nodes with MEMS CCR as a reflector. As a method to position the sensor node, Time of Flight and direction angle between base-station and sensor node are used. The problem in this system is that the intensity of the laser decreases as it propagates forward because of divergence angle and that the reflect area of MEMS CCR is too small to reflect enough power. This makes it hard to measure the TOF and direction angle and as a result the measured distance is very short. To resolve this problem, convergent beam is introduced. The convergent beam has a characteristic that there exists focal point on the optical axis so the beam can be focused on that point. If the focal length is adjusted far away from the base-station, the cross sectional area of the beam decreases as the beam propagates and the intensity of the beam increases enough to use TOF. After this point, the laser beam propagates as like divergent beam. This has the effect that using more powerful laser at nearer to the sensor node. Also by the theoretical analysis of the convergent beam, the offset from the optical axis which can detect MEMS CCR is obtained. To analyze the effect of convergent beam, the beam propagation function is introduced and by this, simulation is conducted.","2093-7121","978-8-9932-1506-9","","10.1109/ICCAS.2014.6987902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987902","Convergent beam;Localization;MEMS CCR;Positioning;Sensor Node;WSN","Optical sensors;Wireless sensor networks","laser beams;micromechanical devices;optical elements;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks","MEMS CCR;TOF measurement;base-station;convergent beam analysis;corner cube reflector;direction angle;divergence angle;divergent beam;focal length;focal point;laser beam propagation;laser source;microelectromechanical system;optical axis;optics-based WSN;sensor node positioning performance;time of flight;wireless sensor network system","","0","","7","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, peer-to-peer traffic may compromise the performance of enterprise critical networked applications or network-based tasks or may overload the network infrastructure of Internet service providers, being desirable that this traffic be blocked in some situations. However, this task may be difficult to achieve, namely for networks operating at very high-speed bit rates and low latency and/or when the traffic is encrypted. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and blocking encrypted traffic generated by eMule, which is one of the most difficult to detect among popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The proposed method is based on eMule signatures, which are coded as SNORT rules, this system being used to detect and block eMule traffic. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate the proposed method. The contribution of the paper falls within peer-to-peer security or within legal and regulatory issues.","","978-1-4244-5084-8","978-0-7695-3831-0","10.1109/AP2PS.2009.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358988","deep packet inspection;eDonkey Network;legal and regulatory issues;peer-to-peer file sharing applications;peer-to-peer security;traffic identification and classification","Application software;Cryptography;Inspection;Law;Legal factors;Multimedia systems;Payloads;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;cryptography;digital signatures;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","Internet service providers;SNORT rules;application signatures;eDonkey network;eMule signatures;eMule traffic;encrypted traffic detection;network-based tasks;peer-to-peer file sharing applications;peer-to-peer traffic","","0","","25","","","11-16 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To ensure a good level of security, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been widely deployed and many techniques to detect, identify and classify attacks have been proposed, developed and tested either offline or online. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based detection technique using a genetic algorithm named Genetic Clustering for Anomaly-based Detection (GC-AD). GC-AD uses a dissimilarity measure to form k clusters. It, then, applies a genetic process where each chromosome represents the centroids of the k clusters. A two-stage fitness function is proposed. i) We introduce a confidence interval to refine the clusters in order to obtain partitions that are more homogeneous. ii) We compute and maximize the inter-cluster variance over the generations. The accuracy of our technique is tested on different subset from KDD99 dataset. The results are discussed and compared to k-means clustering algorithm.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176182","Anomaly-based IDS;KDD 99;clustering;false negative rate;false positive rate;genetic algorithm","Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Statistics","genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;security of data","GC-AD;IDS;KDD99 dataset;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;clustering-based detection technique;computer systems;dissimilarity measure;genetic algorithm;genetic clustering technique;k-means clustering algorithm;network resources security;two-stage fitness function","","0","","19","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","4","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
