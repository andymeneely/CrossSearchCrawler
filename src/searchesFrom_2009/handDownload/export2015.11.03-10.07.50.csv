"Scalable matching and ranking for network search","Uddin, M.; Stadler, R.; Clemm, A.","ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH R.

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100,000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.","","","","10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727844","Network search;distributed management;distributed query processing;innetwork management;matching and ranking","Databases;Measurement;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Search problems;Semantics;Web search","cloud computing;query processing","distributed query processing;echo protocol;network search queries;parallel processing;scalable matching;scalable ranking;search node","","1","","28","","","14-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"On using multiple classifier systems for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) anomaly detection","Mehta, A.; Hantehzadeh, N.; Gurbani, V.K.; Tin Kam Ho; Sander, F.","","Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on","20121129","2012","","","1101","1106","The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an important multimedia session establishment protocol used on the Internet. It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364010","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms;Vectors","Internet;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;unsupervised learning","Euclidean distance classifier;Internet;SIP message;anomaly detection;feature reduction measurement;machine learning algorithm;message malforming;multimedia session establishment protocol;multiple classifier system;self-learning system;session initiation protocol;text-based protocol","","0","","27","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the design and implementation of VAOFS, a Verifiable Append-Only File System for regulatory compliance. Verifiability is provided by a tamper resistant hardware device cooperating with an instrumented file system. Non-appending operations can be detected in an audit process. A time-based secure deletion method is also proposed to handle file deletion in VAOFS.

By modeling the transition probabilities between the SMP states and the sojourn time of each SMP state, the mean times to compromise (MTTCs) of the normal and penetration attacks are calculated. With increased probabilities of breaker trips resulted from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities (LOLP) are evaluated based on IEEE reliability test system 79 (RTS79).

In particular Single Linkage Hierarchical Clustering (SLHC) is attracting considerable interest. Existing clustering algorithms take no account of uncertainties in the data. In this paper, we derive a statistical model for the estimation of dendrograms, taking into account the uncertainty (through noise or corruption) in the distances among data points. We focus on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this ""dendrogram structure"" under SLHC is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described. The proposed concept is demonstrated by a simple Monte Carlo simulation which demonstrates that the proposed MLE method performs better than SLHC in obtaining the correct structure.","","978-1-4799-8728-3","","10.1109/CYBER.2015.7288035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288035","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Couplings;Maximum likelihood estimation;Measurement;Monte Carlo methods","Monte Carlo methods;maximum likelihood estimation;pattern clustering;statistical analysis","MLE method;Monte Carlo simulation;SLHC;approximate maximum likelihood estimator;data points;data uncertainties;dendrogram structure estimation;distance uncertainty;partition hierarchy estimation;single-linkage hierarchical clustering;statistical estimation","","","","","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe the system architecture and discuss the different cases of attack scenarios involving the mobility of the attacking and victim nodes. Our proposed solution takes into account practical issues such as limited resources of the mobile nodes. It has distinct advantages such as monitoring of the traffic to the victim node and the attack traffic being dropped before reaching the victim, the ability to trace back the attacking node and prevent the attack at the home agent or foreign agent that is closer to the attacking node, and the ability to deal with dynamic changes in attack traffic patterns.

Several analyses show that this process can take up to 75% of the time of processing packets. In this paper, relying on the processing power of general purpose graphics cards - which seem to be a better option compared to other hardware technologies like FPGAs with regard to speed, scalability, flexibility, ease of programming and price - and with the idea of having the signature-based detection engine of NIDS systems run on GPU rather than CPU, it is tried to present an efficient method to increase the speed of intrusion detection systems such as Snort.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","27","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Following a case study approach, we then select four prevalent attacks that are suggested by our methodology, and use our findings to identify the underlying vulnerability, and document statistics showing that these vulnerabilities are responsible for the creation of phishing Websites.

Some data capture critical system events, the arrival of these data will significantly influence the monitoring reaction speed, we call them urgent data. High speed urgent data collection would help system to act in real time when facing fatal error. On the other hand, slowing down the collection speed of others may render more bandwidth.

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., “Atak” worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms. We propose different integrated schemes for fighting different self-disciplinary worms, and evaluate their performance via real-world traffic data.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313807","Worm;anomaly detection.;game theory","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Distributed computing;Forensics;Game theory;Traffic control;Web and internet services","Internet;game theory;invasive software","Internet;detection probability;game theoretic formulation;self-disciplinary worms;worm detection schemes;worm propagation","","4","","61","","2009-11-06","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents an approach to detecting human activity using fluctuations in the received signal strength. These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed system has an accuracy of 86% in detecting human activity.

The state-of-the-art approach for network monitoring and analysis involves storage and analysis of network flow statistic. However, this approach loses much valuable information within the Internet traffic. With the advancement of commodity hardware, in particular the volume of storage devices and the speed of interconnect technologies used in network adapter cards and multi-core processors, it is now possible to capture 10 Gbps and beyond real-time network traffic using a commodity computer, such as n2disk. Also with the advancement of distributed file system (such as Hadoop, ZFS, etc.) and open cloud computing platform (such as OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, etc.), it is practical to store such large volume of traffic data and fully in-depth analyse the inside communication within an acceptable latency. In this paper, based on wellknown TimeMachine, we present TIFAflow, the design and implementation of a novel system for archiving and querying network flows. Firstly, we enhance the traffic archiving system named TImemachine+FAstbit (TIFA) with flow granularity, i.e., supply the system with flow table and flow module. Secondly, based on real network traces, we conduct performance comparison experiments of TIFAflow with other implementations such as common database solution, TimeMachine and TIFA system. Finally, based on comparison results, we demonstrate that TIFAflow has a higher performance improvement in storing and querying performance than TimeMachine and TIFA, both in time and space metrics.","","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6574679","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574679","NoSQL;bitmap database;cloud computing;forensic analysis;hadoop distributed file system;network security;phishing attack;traffic archival","Educational institutions;Forensics;Indexing;Internet;Real-time systems","","","","2","","","","","August 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Virtualization technology brings a new chance to protect operating systems out-of-box in hypervisors. This article proposes a system monitoring and controlling framework, named as BMCS, which monitors low-level states and hardware accessing events of operating system in a hypervisor. BMCS abstracts low-level states and events and profiles OS-level semantics with the help of a hosted daemon. Moreover, it can control the execution of operating system software through the hypervisor. Our out-of box method can collect real run-time operating system profile and control the execution of the OS according some defined rules. As a result, it makes the operating system stronger.

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN tunnel. To address this issue, we propose VGuard, a framework that allows a policy owner and a request owner to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy without the policy owner knowing the request and the request owner knowing the policy. We first present an efficient protocol, called Xhash, for oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, without disclosing their numbers to each other. Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of VGuard is to first convert a firewall policy to nonoverlapping numerical rules and then use Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. Comparing with the Cross-Domain Cooperative Firewall (CDCF) framework, which represents the state-of-the-art, VGuard is not only more secure but also orders of magnitude more efficient. On real-life firewall policies, for processing packets, our experimental results show that VGuard is three to four orders of magnitude faster than CDCF.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557862","Virtual private networks;network security.;privacy","Computers;Encryption;IP networks;Privacy;Protocols;Servers;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;protocols;virtual private networks","VGuard framework;VPN technology;Xhash protocol;cross-domain cooperative firewall;encryption tunnel;firewall policy;privacy preserving collaborative enforcement;virtual private networks","","5","","16","","2010-08-26","May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures.

Being based on a set of rules, i.e., attack signatures, the accuracy and reliability of IDS detection heavily depend on the quality of the employed rule set. In this context, any conflicts that arise between rules create ambiguity in classification of network traffic or host events, not only affecting the performance of IDS, but also putting the system in a vulnerable position. Currently existing techniques for conflict detection focus primarily on the security policy of the network devices: IPSec, routers, firewalls. In this paper we address the conflict detection in host and network-based intrusion detection and response devices and present a rule management framework that allows rule set analysis for potential conflicts. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on three collections of attack signatures: the set provided by the vendor of the commercial IDS and the rule sets of the open source Snort IDS and bleeding edge threats.

Previous research works have shown that combination of different types of classifiers provided a good classification results. We noticed a raising interest to incorporate single Bayesian classifier into the multiple classifiers framework. In this light, this research work explored the possibility of employing multiple classifiers approach, but limited to variations of Bayesian technique, namely NaiÂ¿ve Bayes Classifier, Bayesian Networks, and Expert-elicited Bayesian Network. Empirical evaluations were conducted based on a standard network intrusion dataset and the results showed that the multiple Bayesian classifiers approach gave insignificant increase of performance in detecting network intrusions as compared to a single Bayesian classifier. Naives Bayes Classifier should be considered in detecting network intrusions due to its comparable performance with multiple Bayesian classifiers approach. Moreover, time spent for building a NBC was less compared to others.","","978-1-4244-6079-3","978-1-4244-6080-9","10.1109/ICCEA.2010.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445664","Bayesian Classifiers;Intrusion Detection;Multiple Classifiers","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Computer applications;Computer networks;Data mining;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Niobium compounds","belief networks;security of data","expert-elicited Bayesian network;multiple Bayesian classifiers;naive Bayes classifier;network intrusion detection;single Bayesian classifiers","","0","","16","","","19-21 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At this circumstance, when anyone rings your door bell, naturally you won't mind that, whoever the guest may be. At another instance, if you are tired of attending unwelcomed guests n times, chances are there to neglect the guest at the n+1<sup>th</sup> time more consciously. If the guest at the door is an opportunity, it would be evidently missed. Our innovation to conquer this problem is, the video of the person standing at the door is made appeared at the television screen not by replacing the existing cable signal but as a pop up screen which covers a small portion of the TV screen. So, by noticing the pop up, one can decide which is vital either the TV program or the guest.

Cloud computing has opened up a new frontier of challenges by introducing a different type of trust scenario. Today, the problem of trusting cloud computing is a paramount concern for most enterprises. It's not that the enterprises don't trust the cloud providers' intentions rather, they question cloud computing's capabilities regarding the security. To trust on the cloud, the cloud computing should have the appropriate technologies to tackle the accompanying challenges of trust. In this paper we proposed an algorithm which can increase the trust of the client on the cloud service provider. Different researchers have proposed different algorithms like data encryption and data decryption using private or public key concepts. But trust to cloud is basically based on cloud trust policies, which is not enough for the client to use cloud for the sensitive data. In this paper the proposed algorithm uses a function called key_function and the key which increases the trust to cloud during transmission. The cloud can ensure that the cloud server is providing necessary security for the user's data during transmission. By matching the key which is updated by the key_function, the user can be secured that the data accessed from the cloud server is secured.","","978-1-4799-3447-8","","10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6922015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922015","SAAS;decryption;encryption;key;trust","Availability;Irrigation","cloud computing;cryptography;trusted computing","cloud computing;cloud service provider;cloud trust policy;computing services;data decryption;data encryption;key_function;private key concept;public key concept;trust scenario;user trust","","0","","26","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such algorithms assign tasks to nodes by sequentially selecting the best nodes as leaders. Since the correct functionality of such algorithms depends on the truthfulness of participant nodes, any misbehavior can disrupt the operation of the network due to absence of a centralized monitoring unit. In this paper, we consider the problem of malicious behavior in leader-based MANETs. Current solution analyzes the behavior of the leader by means of some checker nodes. This approach is vulnerable since a malicious checker can ruin the character of a normal behaving leader, and declare it as a malicious one. We propose an efficient self-organizing mechanism which can detect a malicious behaving leader, while protecting a normal behaving leader from being declared as a malicious node. In addition, our mechanism is designed with no constraints on leader selection algorithm, which makes it applicable to any kind of leader-based network. We also provide several simulation results, showing that our proposed mechanism is efficient and effective even for large MANETs.","2156-9711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686475","Leader-Based MANETs;Malicious Behavior;Malicious Detection;Self-Organizing Algorithms","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Lead;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Performance evaluation","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;centralized monitoring unit;checker nodes;leader-based mobile ad-hoc networks;malicious behaving leader;malicious checker;malicious detection;normal behaving leader;participant nodes;task-based self-organizing algorithms","","0","","7","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, security issues have not been treated properly in CAN, although CAN control messages could be life-critical. With the appearance of the connected car environment, in-vehicle networks (e.g., CAN) are now connected to external networks (e.g., 3G/4G mobile networks), enabling an adversary to perform a long-range wireless attack using CAN vulnerabilities. In this paper we show that a long-range wireless attack is physically possible using a real vehicle and malicious smartphone application in a connected car environment.

In order to deal with these threats, the model in terms of the dendritic cells algorithm (DCA) is presented to detect P2P bots on an individual host. The detailed approach to detect P2P bots is also described. The raw data for P2P bots detection are obtained via APITrace tool. The processes ID are mapped into the antigens, and the behavioral data created by the processes are mapped into the signals, which are the time series input data of DCA. These data as the input data of the algorithm are used to implement data fusion and correlation. Through related experiments, the systems using the proposed method in this paper can detect p2p bots. The method should outperform the other existing P2P detection techniques due to its linear computation in the process of detection and analysis, and no training phrase.","","978-1-4799-6417-8","","10.1109/ICEDIF.2015.7280211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280211","P2P bots;anomaly coefficient;correlation;data fusion;dendritic cells algorithm","Servers","computer network security;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;sensor fusion;time series","DCA;P2P botnet;P2P bots detection;P2P detection technique;P2P protocol;data correlation;data fusion;dendritic cells algorithm;linear computation;network security;time series input data","","","","","","","10-11 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to model normal behaviors accurately and improve the performance of intrusion detection, a joint evolutionary neural network (JENN) is presented in this paper. Input features, network structure and connection weights are evolved jointly using genetic algorithm. To evolve all three tasks jointly, a hybrid representation scheme is employed, and penalty factors for the number of input nodes and hidden nodes are introduced into fitness function.

In this paper, we propose a model-based technique for building intrusion detection systems (IDS) for smart meters, that takes these constraints into account.

A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers. We define this mapping for a) various types of tree structures that have been proposed previously for dynamic wireless systems and b) a hypercube structure that presents promising resiliency characteristics.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

Thus, a high-performance signature matching scheme is of great importance for a signature-based IDS. In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

Apart from the advantages the cloud offers, it can also bring in some potential security threats to the organization by not having organization specific firewalls, monitoring mechanisms and physical security. This limits the chances that companies move onto the cloud, which could have otherwise become an extremely attractive alternative for the businesses. The need is to make cloud services more reliable and trustworthy for the businesses by providing a proper security mechanism that addresses the existing drawbacks in cloud computing. The key is a firewall model that constitutes a centralized Cloud Firewall Management Server and Firewall Clients that communicate with the Cloud Firewall Management Server. This enables the organizations to maintain their own control over the firewall and firewall policies. This model does not share any information with the cloud service provider thereby providing a fully trusted solution for the businesses and additionally caters for the audit needs of the businesses by making all the information available at the central Cloud Firewall Management Server.","","978-1-4799-0908-7","","10.1109/ICIInfS.2013.6731960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6731960","Cloud computing;Firewall;Security","Cloud computing;Companies;Computational modeling;Security;Servers","client-server systems;cloud computing;firewalls;organisational aspects;trusted computing","business audit;business world;centralized cloud firewall management server;cloud computing;cloud service provider;cloud services;firewall clients;firewall policies;information sharing;infrastructure maintenance;monitoring mechanisms;organization security threats;physical security;trustworthy computing","","0","","9","","","17-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes application of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for network intrusion detection system. Any action that tries to compromise the confidentially, integrity or availability of resources is termed as intrusion and the detection of such intrusion by the help of a system is called as intrusion detection system (IDS). The proposed GA is a hybrid evolutionary technique specially developed for intrusion detection. The technique developed has been implemented and the experiments have shown the promising results. The evolutionary process of this technique including its parameters and the experimental outcomes are discussed at length in this paper. In this paper we have made the comparison of our technique with the GNN classifier technique and the outcomes from our experiment have given promising results towards applying genetic algorithm for network intrusion detection.","","978-9-3805-4415-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100562","Intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;security;wireless networking","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Statistics;Testing;Training","computer network security;genetic algorithms;radio networks","genetic algorithm;hybrid evolutionary technique;network intrusion detection system;wireless networks","","0","","21","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Of those widely deployed are content adaptation mechanisms whereby the quality level of the content is adapted dynamically to mitigate overload conditions. Serving degraded content reduces strain on resources and enables them to cater for a larger set of clients. To that end, this paper studies adversarial exploits of dynamic content adaptation mechanisms to a new instantiation of reduction of quality (RoQ) attacks. The RoQ attack pattern is orchestrated to cause different forms of damage such as longer response time for legitimate clients, degraded content being served and underutilization of resources. We assess the impact of RoQ attacks via the potency metric which reflects the tradeoffs between the damage inflicted and the cost in mounting the attack. We validate our results through numerical analysis as well as real Internet experiments.","","978-1-4244-3470-1","978-0-7695-3552-4","10.1109/ICN.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976714","Content Adaptation;Security;Server Overload","Capacitive sensors;Computer networks;Computer science;Costs;Degradation;Delay;Internet;Numerical analysis;Waste materials;Web server","content management;resource allocation;security of data","RoQ attack pattern;RoQ attacks;computing systems;dynamic content adaptation;numerical analysis;potency metric","","1","","21","","","1-6 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-Government sites often contain data that must remain available to its users with as little interruption as possible. In case an intrusion into such a system is detected, quick damage assessment and recovery of data is vital for maintaining system functionality. Conventional log based damage assessment methods require that the log of an affected database must be scanned from the occurrence of the attacking transaction to the end of the log. Hence, these methods result in slow recovery time since they have to unnecessarily process large volume of data, a lot of which may be unaffected by the attack. In this paper, we have provided a model that can expedite the damage assessment and recovery process by using minimal log access. Our approach uses multiple agents to perform damage assessment and recovery processes in parallel and, as a result, minimizes system down time.","1530-1605","","","10.1109/HICSS.2015.272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070086","Cyber Attack;Data Recovery;Database Transactions;Dependency Relationships","Aging;Databases;Electronic government;History;Security;System recovery","database management systems;government data processing;security of data;software agents","agent based approach;critical information;cyber attack;data damage assessment;data damage recovery;data processing;data recovery time;e-government database security;e-government sites;minimal log access;system down time minimization;system functionality maintenance;system intrusion detection","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mechanism of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is normally used to protect the wireless networks for security purposes in MANETs. In case of MANETs, intrusion detection system is favored since the first day of their invention. Communication is restricted to the transmitters within a radio frequency range. Owing to the superior technology that reduces the cost of infrastructure services to gain more importance in autonomous topology of mobile nodes. A novel IDS, EAACK is mainly a secure authentication method using acknowledgment for MANETs to transmit packets in mobility nodes. In this case, out of range in mobile nodes cases security issues while transmitting data from source to destination nodes. This results that the communication of each mobility nodes takes place in radio frequency range and the out of range in communication leads the parties to relay data transmissions to reach the destination node.","","978-1-4799-6084-2","","10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226169","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK);Hybrid Cryptographic Key Exchange Algorithm","Access control;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Conferences;Cryptography;Mobile computing","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;safety systems;telecommunication security","EAACK;mobile ad hoc network;mobile nodes;secure authentication method;secure intrusion detection system;wireless MANET","","0","","15","","","5-7 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sophisticated attackers can, however, employ a number of obfuscation techniques to confuse the alert correlation engine or classifier. Recognizing the need for a systematic analysis of the impact of attack obfuscation, this paper models attack strategies as general finite order Markov models, and treats obfuscated observations as noises. Taking into account that only finite observation window and limited computational time can be afforded, this work develops an algorithm to efficiently inference on the joint distribution of clean and obfuscated attack sequences. The inference algorithm recovers the optimal match of obfuscated sequences to attack models, and enables a systematic and quantitative analysis on the impact of obfuscation on attack classification.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903567","","Computational modeling;Dynamic programming;Hidden Markov models;Inference algorithms;Markov processes;Probabilistic logic;Vectors","Markov processes;computer network security;invasive software","Markov models;attack obfuscation;diverse network attack strategies;finite observation window;limited computational time;obfuscated attack sequences;obfuscated network attack sequences;observed malicious events;probabilistic inference;sophisticated attackers;systematic analysis","","0","","27","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
