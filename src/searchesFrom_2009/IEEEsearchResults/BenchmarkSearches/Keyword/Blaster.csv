These worms attack pattern are further analyzed to form the general worms' attack pattern which describes the process of worms' infection.

Our network features mainly consist of characteristics of IP address, port, protocol and some flags of packet header. These features are used to detect and classify behavior of internet worm by using 3 different data mining algorithms which are Bayesian Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In addition, our approach not only can classify internet worm apart from the normal data, but also can classify network attacks that have similar behaviors to the internet worm behaviors.

An Information-Theoretic View of Network-Aware Malware Attacks,Zesheng Chen; Chuanyi Ji,"Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Florida Int. Univ., Miami, FL, USA","Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Transactions on",20090818,2009,4,3,530,541,"This work provides an information-theoretic view to better understand the relationships between aggregated vulnerability information viewed by attackers and a class of randomized epidemic scanning algorithms. In particular, this work investigates three aspects: 1) a <i>network</i> <i>vulnerability</i> as the nonuniform vulnerable-host distribution, 2) <i>threats</i>, i.e., intelligent malwares that exploit such a vulnerability, and 3) <i>defense</i>, i.e., challenges for fighting the threats. We first study five large data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new metric, referred to as the <i>nonuniformity</i> <i>factor</i>, that quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the Renyi information entropy that unifies the nonuniformity of a vulnerable-host distribution with different malware-scanning methods. Next, we draw a relationship between Renyi entropies and randomized epidemic scanning algorithms. We find that the infection rates of malware-scanning methods are characterized by the Renyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a nonunform vulnerable-host distribution extracted by a randomized scanning algorithm. Meanwhile, we show that a representative network-aware malware can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a nonuniformity factor when compared to a random-scanning malware at an early stage of malware propagation. This quantifies that how much more rapidly the Internet can be infected at the early stage when a malware exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a network-wide vulnerability. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network-aware malwares. Our results demonstrate that counteracting network-aware malwares is a significant challenge for the strategies that include host-based defenses and IPv6.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2009.2025847,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5153282,Attack models;network security;performance metrics,,IP networks;Internet;computer networks;entropy;invasive software,IPv6;Internet;Renyi information entropy;information-theoretic view;intelligent malwares;malware propagation;malware-scanning methods;network vulnerability;network-aware Malware attacks;nonuniform vulnerable-host distribution;nonuniformity factor;random-scanning malware;randomized epidemic scanning algorithms;vulnerability information,,8,,44,,6/30/2009,Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks.

Conventional detection systems using signature-based and/or rule-based anomaly detection techniques no longer suffice. It is difficult to predict what form the next malware attack will take and these pose a great challenge to the design of a robust intrusion detection system. We focus on the anomalous behavioral characteristics between attack and victim when they undergo sequences of compromising actions and that are inherent to the classes of vulnerability-exploit attacks. A new approach, Gestalt, is proposed to statefully capture and monitor activities between hosts and progressively assess possible network anomalies by multilevel behavior tracking, cross-level triggering and correlation, and a probabilistic inference model is proposed for intrusion assessment and detection. Such multilevel design provides a collective perspective to reveal more anomalies than individual levels.

By means of netflow, packets were collected from Internet. Analyzing these data, four addresses (source IP/port and destination IP/port) were abstracted to form information entropy, which was extended from thermodynamic. Based on information entropy, risk coefficient was defined to describe the whole condition of network security. To forecast the change of risk coefficient, a model was set up according to grey theory. Using a few data, the model can forecast risk coefficient accurately. Simulation and experiments were completed by MATLAB and in LAN. The experiments in LAN prove that information entropy can reflect anomaly traffic caused by DDoS attacks and Internet worms in time and effectively. The simulation by MATLAB shows that by GM(1,1) information entropy and risk coefficient can be forecasted accurately.

Using a dataset containing hundreds of variants for several major malware families, our method achieves 98.6% classification accuracy using the signatures generated by the DBN.

However, most existing network-based signatures are specific to exploit and can be easily evaded. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching.
