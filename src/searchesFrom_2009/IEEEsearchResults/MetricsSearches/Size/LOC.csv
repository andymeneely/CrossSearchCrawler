Open-Flow as a major API for SDN applies <;match, action> rules to every packet. However, it only supports a few actions that are all predefined. We extend this limitation of OpenFlow and propose User-Defined Actions (UDAs) for SDN. We discuss usecases of UDAs and propose an architecture to realize UDAs. Using our architecture we conduct a series of tests. We indicate that our UDAs can elevate millisecond-scale running time of current proposals to nanosecond-scale (including proposals from northbound applications of SDN community and virtual appliances of Network Function Virtualization or NFV community). Also, regarding ease of programmability, we show that our proposal decrease the lines of code of by 72.9% and 79.3% compared to implementing the same functionality as a northbound application and as a standalone middlebox, respectively.

Software Crash Analysis for Automatic Exploit Generation on Binary Programs,Shih-Kun Huang; Min-Hsiang Huang; Po-Yen Huang; Han-Lin Lu; Chung-Wei Lai,"Inf. Technol. Service Center, Nat. Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20140227,2014,63,1,270,289,"This paper presents a new method, capable of automatically generating attacks on binary programs from software crashes. We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt.

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms.

IEEE Symposium on",20090515,2009,,,83,90,"In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for database intrusion detection which combines evidences from current as well as past behavior of users. It consists of four components, namely, rule-based component, belief combination component, security sensitive history database component and Bayesian learning component. The rule-based component consists of a set of well-defined rules which give independent evidences about a transaction's behavior. An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed.

In this paper, we advocate content parsing to empower SDN with finer grained control ability over traffic. Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace.

We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier. In this configuration, Snap is able to forward 40 million packets per second, saturating four 10 Gbps NICs at packet sizes as small as 128 byes.

In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM.

Packets everywhere: The great opportunity for field programmable technology,"Brebner, G.","Xilinx Res. Labs., San Jose, CA, USA","Field-Programmable Technology, 2009. FPT 2009. International Conference on",20100112,2009,,,1,10,"The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification.

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards.

This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.",0098-5589,,,10.1109/TSE.2010.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528,Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing,Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server,Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing,ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols,,5,,34,,6/17/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection,Jiang Ming; Haibin Zhang; Debin Gao,"Coll. of Inf. Sci. & Technol., Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","Network and System Security (NSS), 2011 5th International Conference on",20111027,2011,,,25,32,"Anomaly detection has been attracting interests from researchers due to its advantage of being able to detect zero-day exploits. A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.",,978-1-4577-0458-1,,10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956,anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis,Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training,security of data,file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits,,2,,24,,,6-8 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Vetting SSL Usage in Applications with SSLINT,"Boyuan He; Rastogi, V.; Yinzhi Cao; Yan Chen; Venkatakrishnan, V.N.; Runqing Yang; Zhenrui Zhang",,"Security and Privacy (SP), 2015 IEEE Symposium on",20150720,2015,,,519,534,"Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols have become the security backbone of the Web and Internet today. Many systems including mobile and desktop applications are protected by SSL/TLS protocols against network attacks. However, many vulnerabilities caused by incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs have been uncovered in recent years. Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs. SSLINT is capable of performing automatic logic verification with high efficiency and good accuracy. To demonstrate it, we apply SSLINT to one of the most popular Linux distributions -- Ubuntu. We find 27 previously unknown SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in Ubuntu applications, most of which are also distributed with other Linux distributions.",1081-6011,,,10.1109/SP.2015.38,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163045,,Accuracy;Libraries;Protocols;Security;Servers;Software;Testing,Linux;application program interfaces;formal verification;program diagnostics;protocols;security of data,API design;Linux distributions;SSL usage vetting;SSL-TLS protocols;SSLINT;Ubuntu;application program interfaces;automatic logic verification;code quality;logic correctness;network attacks;secure sockets layer;static analysis system;transport layer security,,0,,52,,,17-21 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
A forensic hypervisor for process tracking and exploit discovery,"Kuhn, S.; Taylor, S.","Thayer Sch. of Eng., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2012 - MILCOM 2012",20130128,2012,,,1,5,"Real-time forensic reconstruction of a processes memory and interaction history is impractical in modern computing environments because the volume of data processed by a typical server is immense. Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts. This paper describes a novel forensic hypervisor design that provides coarse-grained process tracking and utilizes next generation Intel virtualization technology, leveraging extended page tables and enforcing MULTICS style protection techniques. Custom forensic introspection techniques are used to walk the extended page tables to inspect a virtual machines state and track the associated processes. A description of the steps necessary to perform tracking are presented; the real-time performance impact is quantified at less than 11μs for each system call.",2155-7578,978-1-4673-1729-0,,10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415817,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415817,Forensics;Introspection;Operating Systems;Virtualization,Forensics;Hardware;Kernel;Program processors;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization,digital forensics;formal verification;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation,MULTICS style protection technique;computing environment;custom forensic introspection;data verification;exploit discovery;forensic hypervisor design;forensic information;interaction history;intrusion;memory;next generation Intel virtualization technology;operating system;page table;process tracking;real-time forensic reconstruction;server;system component;system recovery;virtual machine,,1,,22,,,Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A Survey on Security for Mobile Devices,"La Polla, M.; Martinelli, F.; Sgandurra, D.","Ist. di Inf. e Telematica, Consiglio Naz. delle Ric., Pisa, Italy","Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE",20130205,2013,15,1,446,471,"Nowadays, mobile devices are an important part of our everyday lives since they enable us to access a large variety of ubiquitous services. In recent years, the availability of these ubiquitous and mobile services has significantly increased due to the different form of connectivity provided by mobile devices, such as GSM, GPRS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools.

Security in MPSoCs: A NoC Firewall and an Evaluation Framework,"Grammatikakis, M.D.; Papadimitriou, K.; Petrakis, P.; Papagrigoriou, A.; Kornaros, G.; Christoforakis, I.; Tomoutzoglou, O.; Tsamis, G.; Coppola, M.","Technol. Educ. Inst. of Crete, Heraklion, Greece","Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20150724,2015,34,8,1344,1357,"In multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), a CPU can access physical resources, such as on-chip memory or I/O devices. Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.",0278-0070,,,10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504,Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security,Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip,firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip,AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests,,0,,28,,6/23/2015,Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
