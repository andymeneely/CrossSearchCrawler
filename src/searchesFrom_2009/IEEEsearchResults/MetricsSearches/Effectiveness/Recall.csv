Decision making is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the whole dataset is divided into some predetermined arbitrary subgroups. The proposed algorithm selects representative samples from these subgroups such that the samples reflect the entire dataset. An optimum allocation scheme is developed based on the variability of the observations within the subgroups. In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted samples to detect intrusions. We call the proposed algorithm as optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine (OA-LS-SVM) for IDS.

This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module.

BriGuard: a lightweight indoor intrusion detection system based on infrared light spot displacement,Leibo Liu; Weilong Zhang; Chenchen Deng; Shouyi Yin; Shaojun Wei,"Nat. Lab. for Inf. Sci. & Technol., Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Science, Measurement & Technology, IET",20150423,2015,9,3,306,314,"Indoor intrusion detection systems are widely implemented in many special departments and environments. Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.",1751-8822,,,10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380,,,CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance,BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate,,0,,,,,5 2015,,IET,IET Journals & Magazines,,,

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2012.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739,Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness,Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates,computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic,Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design,,1,,40,,5/29/2012,Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Center, Herzliya, Israel","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20140417,2014,22,2,415,428,"A central component in all contemporary intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is their pattern matching algorithms, which are often based on constructing and traversing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that represents the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357,Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM),,IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data,DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory,,1,,34,,4/4/2013,Apr-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

In this paper, we address the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous networks consisting of nodes with different noncorrelated security assets. In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to configure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means.

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased.

However the attacker is likely to attempt to reenter the system, and if the attacker succeeds in reentering, it might take some time for the defender's intrusion detection system (IDS) to re-detect the attacker's presence. In this interaction, both the attacker and defender are learning about each other - their vulnerabilities, intentions, and methods. Moreover, during periods when the attacker has reentered the system undetected, he is likely learning faster than the defender. The more the attacker learns, the greater the chance that he succeeds in his objective - whether it be stealing information, inserting malware, or some other objective. Conversely, the greater the defender's knowledge, the more likely that the defender can prevent the attacker from succeeding. In this setting, we study the defender's optimal strategy for expelling or not expelling an intruder. We find that the policy of always expelling the attacker can be far from optimal. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), we find how the optimal decision depends on the state variables and model parameters that characterize the IDS's detection rate and the attacker's persistence.",,978-1-4244-5870-7,,10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394923,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394923,,Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection,Markov processes;decision theory;information systems;invasive software,Markov decision process;attacker detection;attacker expelling;information system;intrusion detection system;malware,,0,,12,,,Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics.

Kangaroo: Accelerating String Matching by Running Multiple Collaborative Finite State Machines,Xiaofei Wang; Bin Liu; Junchen Jiang; Yang Xu; Yi Wang; Xiaojun Wang,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20141127,2014,32,10,1784,1796,"String matching is a key technique for network security applications such as network intrusion detection systems and antivirus scanners, where the payload of every packet is inspected against thousands of patterns in real time. As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731,Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine,Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput,deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching,ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching,,1,,30,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes.

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack.

Furthermore, due to their popularity and users ability to create content, Web 2.0 applications have become particularly attractive targets. These trends clearly illustrate the need for better understanding of malicious cyber activities based on both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes.

TFA: A Tunable Finite Automaton for Pattern Matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Yang Xu; Junchen Jiang; Rihua Wei; Yang Song; Chao, H.J.","Polytech.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778,Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion,Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management,finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data,Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton,,0,,25,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,
One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier,"Al Naqshbandi, S.M.; Samawi, V.W.","Tilburg centre for Cognition & Commun., Tilburg Univ., Tilburg, Netherlands","Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE), 2012 IEEE International Conference on",20120820,2012,2,,204,208,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the widely used tools for defending computer networks. Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible.

Robust and Fast Pattern Matching for Intrusion Detection,"Namjoshi, K.; Narlikar, G.","Bell Labs., Alcatel-Lucent, Paris, France","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE",20100506,2010,,,1,9,"The rule language of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a critical role in its effectiveness. A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149,,Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness,backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data,Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language,,4,1,36,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks.

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

Background Modeling Through Statistical Edge-Segment Distributions,"Ramirez Rivera, A.; Murshed, M.; Jaemyun Kim; Oksam Chae","Dept. of Comput. Eng., Kyung Hee Univ., Yongin, South Korea","Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on",20130731,2013,23,8,1375,1387,"Background modeling is challenging due to background dynamism. Most background modeling methods fail in the presence of intensity changes, because the model cannot handle sudden changes. A solution to this problem is to use intensity-robust features. Despite the changes of an edge's shape and position among frames, edges are less sensitive than a pixel's intensity to illumination changes. Furthermore, background models in the presence of moving objects produce ghosts in the detected output, because high quality models require ideal backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a robust statistical edge-segment-based method for background modeling of non-ideal sequences. The proposed method learns the structure of the scene using the edges' behaviors through the use of kernel-density distributions. Moreover, it uses segment features to overcome the shape and position variations of the edges. Hence, the use of segments gives us local information of the scene, and that helps us to predict the objects and background precisely. Furthermore, we accumulate segments to build edge distributions, which allow us to perform unconstrained training and to overcome the ghost effect. In addition, the proposed method uses adaptive thresholding (in the segments) to detect the moving objects. Therefore, this approach increases the accuracy over previous methods, which use fixed thresholds.",1051-8215,,,10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2242551,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423877,Background modeling;edge-segments;motion detection;object detection,Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Integrated circuit modeling;Kernel;Lighting;Robustness;Shape,edge detection;image segmentation;image sequences,background dynamism;background modeling;intensity changes;kernel-density distributions;nonideal sequences;statistical edge-segment distributions,,4,,33,,1/30/2013,Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the “big-dataism”. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud.

The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469,Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion,,Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion,Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning,,10,,27,,7/7/2009,Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks.

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals).

The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field.

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts.

It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality.

Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes.

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds.

Therefore, additional steps must be taken to ensure data security and integrity of the applications.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA “10. KIDS” core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties.

Sci., Towson Univ., Towson, MD, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110314,2011,8,3,377,390,"Active worms pose major security threats to the Internet. This is due to the ability of active worms to propagate in an automated fashion as they continuously compromise computers on the Internet. Active worms evolve during their propagation, and thus, pose great challenges to defend against them. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, referred to as Camouflaging Worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm is different from traditional worms because of its ability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time. Thereby, the C-Worm camouflages its propagation from existing worm detection systems based on analyzing the propagation traffic generated by worms. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and nonworm traffic (background traffic). We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain. However, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the Power Spectral Density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from background traffic. Using a comprehensive set of detection metrics and real-world traces as background traffic, we conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed spectrum-based detection scheme. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation. Furthermore, we show the generality of our spectrum-based scheme in effectively detecting not only the C-Worm, but traditional worms as well.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.13,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444887,Worm;anomaly detection.;camouflage,Computer networks;Computer worms;Density measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Internet;Large-scale systems;Power measurement;Recruitment;Telecommunication traffic;Volume measurement,Internet;invasive software,C-Worm propagation detection;Internet;active worms;background traffic;camouflaging worm detection;camouflaging worm modeling;nonworm traffic;power spectral density distribution;propagation traffic;security threats;spectral flatness measure;spectrum-based scheme,,7,,65,,4/8/2010,May-June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process.

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., “Atak” worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms.

We focus on the early detection of behavioral patterns of malware families rather than the detection of malware binary signatures.

The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes.

To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected.

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH.

An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers,"Danhua Guo; Bhuyan, L.N.; Bin Liu","Microsoft Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20121011,2012,20,5,1426,1439,"L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors.

We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes.

The cognitive nodes in the network can dynamically adapt to changing network environments by adjusting their design parameter settings over time to establish an acceptable trust level with other nodes.

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks.

Hierarchical Trust Management for Wireless Sensor Networks and its Applications to Trust-Based Routing and Intrusion Detection,Fenye Bao; Ing-Ray Chen; MoonJeong Chang; Jin-Hee Cho,"Dept. of Comput.

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead.

Data preprocessing for distance-based unsupervised Intrusion Detection,"Said, D.; Stirling, L.; Federolf, P.; Barker, K.","Dept. of Comput.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2010.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493,Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation,,digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures,NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering,,7,,36,,6/17/2010,Apr-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Classification of Disturbances and Cyber-Attacks in Power Systems Using Heterogeneous Time-Synchronized Data,"Shengyi Pan; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.","Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS, USA","Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on",20150602,2015,11,3,650,662,"Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults.

These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on ""traditional"" graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures.

Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic.

While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.",,978-1-4799-6452-9,,10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039,,Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing,graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management,CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance,,0,,31,,,26-28 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
Towards an Information-Theoretic Approach for Measuring Intelligent False Alarm Reduction in Intrusion Detection,Yuxin Meng; Lam-for Kwok,"Dept. of Comput.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.",,,,10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847,Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection,Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement,information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation,,1,,24,,,16-18 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks.

"Intrusion detection in distributed systems, an approach based on taint marking","Hauser, C.; Tronel, F.; Fidge, C.; Me, L.","CIDre Team, Supelec, Rennes, France","Communications (ICC), 2013 IEEE International Conference on",20131107,2013,,,1962,1967,"This paper presents a new framework for distributed intrusion detection based on taint marking. Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel.

In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.",,,,10.1109/ARES.2013.42,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258,Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security,Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology,mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security,MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols,,1,,9,,,2-6 Sept. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users.

The architecture's approach to naming and addressing fundamentally differs from the approach used in the current Internet. Great care is taken to distinguish between names and addresses. Names are used to identify entities and generally have a large scope. Addresses, however, are used to locate entities within a limited scope and are consequently not necessarily globally significant.

Anomaly Detection via Online Oversampling Principal Component Analysis,"Lee, Yuh-Jye; Yeh, Yi-Ren; Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank","National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei","Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20130521,2013,25,7,1460,1470,"Anomaly detection has been an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",1041-4347,,,10.1109/TKDE.2012.99,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273,Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis,Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis,,,,4,,26,,5/15/2012,Jul-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Several localization approaches have been proposed but most of them omit to consider that WSNs could be deployed in adversarial settings, where hostile nodes under the control of an attacker coexist with faithful ones. Verifiable multilateration (VM) was proposed to cope with this problem by leveraging on a set of trusted landmark nodes that act as verifiers. Although VM is able to recognize reliable localization measures, it allows for regions of undecided positions that can amount to the 40 percent of the monitored area. We studied the properties of VM as a noncooperative two-player game where the first player employs a number of verifiers to do VM computations and the second player controls a malicious node. The verifiers aim at securely localizing malicious nodes, while malicious nodes strive to masquerade as unknown and to pretend false positions. Thanks to game theory, the potentialities of VM are analyzed with the aim of improving the defender's strategy. We found that the best placement for verifiers is an equilateral triangle with edge equal to the power range R, and maximum deception in the undecided region is approximately 0.27R.

For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory. This analysis is done for GPUs with one I/O channel to the host as well as those with 2. Experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU that has 240 cores running off of a Xeon 2.8 GHz quad-core host CPU show that, for the GPU-to-GPU case, our Aho-Corasick GPU adaptation achieves a speedup between 8.5 and 9.5 relative to a single-thread CPU implementation and between 2.4 and 3.2 relative to the best multithreaded implementation.

In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches.

The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features.

In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively.

Both signature matching and a variety of feature-based pattern recognition methods have been applied to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied.

The first generation of AISs which is inspired only by the adaptive immune system has some weak points and suffers from excessive amount of false alarms. The next generation of AISs is inspired by “Danger Theory” and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters.

CompactDFA: Generic State Machine Compression for Scalable Pattern Matching,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

A number of computerized systems-including ATM networks, web servers, and intrusion detection systems-systematically track every atomic action we perform, thus generating massive streams of timestamped observation data, possibly from multiple concurrent activities. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently detecting occurrences of high-level activities from such interleaved data streams. A solution to this important problem would greatly benefit a broad range of applications, including fraud detection, video surveillance, and cyber security. There has been extensive work in the last few years on modeling activities using probabilistic models. In this paper, we propose a temporal probabilistic graph so that the elapsed time between observations also plays a role in defining whether a sequence of observations constitutes an activity. We first propose a data structure called “temporal multiactivity graph” to store multiple activities that need to be concurrently monitored. We then define an index called Temporal Multiactivity Graph Index Creation (tMAGIC) that, based on this data structure, examines and links observations as they occur. We define algorithms for insertion and bulk insertion into the tMAGIC index and show that this can be efficiently accomplished. We also define algorithms to solve two problems: the “evidence” problem that tries to find all occurrences of an activity (with probability over a threshold) within a given sequence of observations, and the “identification” problem that tries to find the activity that best matches a sequence of observations. We introduce complexity reducing restrictions and pruning strategies to make the problem-which is intrinsically exponential-linear to the number of observations.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load.

However, research on security metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling zero-day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because a more secure configuration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our metric counts how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security because the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will be significantly lower.

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution.

Incorporating Attack-Type Uncertainty Into Network Protection,"Garnaev, A.; Baykal-Gursoy, M.; Poor, H.V.","Wireless Inf. Network Lab., Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ, USA","Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Transactions on",20140711,2014,9,8,1278,1287,"Network security against possible attacks involves making decisions under uncertainty. Not only may one be ignorant of the place, the power, or the time of potential attacks, one may also be largely ignorant of the attacker's purpose. To illustrate this phenomenon, this paper proposes a simple Bayesian game-theoretic model of allocating defensive (scanning) effort among nodes of a network in which a network's defender does not know the adversary's motivation for intruding on the network, e.g., to bring the maximal damage to the network (for example, to steal credit card numbers or information on bank accounts stored there) or to infiltrate the network for other purposes (for example, to corrupt nodes for a further distributed denial of service botnet attack on servers). Due to limited defensive capabilities, the defender faces the dilemma of either: 1) focusing on increasing defense of the most valuable nodes, and in turn, increasing the chance for the adversary to sneak into the network through less valuable nodes or 2) taking care of defense of all the nodes, and in turn, reducing the level of defense of the most valuable ones. An explicit solution to this dilemma is suggested based on the information available to the defender, and it is shown how this information allows the authorities to increase the efficiency of a network's defense. Some interesting properties of the rivals' strategies are presented. Notably, the adversary's strategy has a node-sharing structure and the adversary's payoffs have a discontinuous dependence on the probability of the attack's type. This discontinuity implies that the defender has to take into account the human factor since some threshold values of this inclination in the adversary's behavior could make the defender's policy very sensitive to small perturbations, while in other situations it produces minimal impact.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2014.2329241,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827188,Bayesian equilibrium;computer networks;infrastructure networks;network protection;scan;search,Bayes methods;Computers;Forensics;Games;Jamming;Security;Uncertainty,Bayes methods;computer network security;decision making;game theory;human factors;probability,Bayesian game-theoretic model;adversary behavior;adversary motivation;adversary strategy;attack-type uncertainty;decision making;defensive capabilities;defensive effort;distributed denial of service botnet attack;human factor;network defender;network protection;network security;node-sharing structure,,4,,36,,6/6/2014,Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Hardware implementation for scalable lookahead Regular Expression detection,"Bando, M.; Artan, N.S.; Mehta, N.; Yi Guan; Chao, H.J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Polytech.

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine.

When a cyber security incident occurs, the critical question that security administrators are concerned about is: What has happened? Cyber situation assessment is critical to making correct and timely defense decisions by the analysts. STIX ontology, which was developed by taking advantage of existing cyber security related standards, is used to represent cyber threat information and infer important features of the cyber situation that help decision makers form their situational awareness. However, due to the widespread application of information technology, security analysts face a challenge in information overload. There are still huge volumes of low level observations captured by various sensors and network tools that need to be used to derive the high level intelligence queries such as potential courses of action and future impact. Therefore, identification of the relevant cyber threat information for a specific query is a crucial procedure for cyber situation assessment. In this paper, we leverage the STIX ontology to represent cyber threat information in a logical framework.

When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way.

It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems.

However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers. In a previous work, we proposed a cryptographic approach called “conditional data sharing”, devised to permit disclosure of cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets of network monitoring data, only when a threshold number of domains are ready to reveal their data.

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer).

Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think,"Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.",,"Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,185,190,"A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.",,,,10.1109/SPW.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302,,Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches,Internet;finite state machines;protocols,FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications,,0,,9,,,17-18 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.249,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538,Keywords—Local monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.,Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication,,6,,39,,12/30/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

In this paper, we derive a statistical model for the estimation of dendrograms, taking into account the uncertainty (through noise or corruption) in the distances among data points. We focus on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this ""dendrogram structure"" under SLHC is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described.

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures.

Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan.

The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based.

Rough set theory is used for feature reduction and Naive Bayes theorem is used for classification of documents into the predefined categories by means of the probabilistic values. The deployment of the proposed model is planned through an enhanced method of the utilization of the Naive Bayes approach and rough set theory to overcome the imprecision and vagueness in data set thus improving the classification accuracy. In Naive Bayes model, the word probabilities for a class are estimated by calculating the likelihood in the entire training documents where the training and test data are split randomly into k-subsets like 2/3 for training and 1/3 for test data. In addition, it also utilizes two level hierarchy structures for training documents like features from title, keywords and content with the predefined knowledge available. The rough set model includes the feature reduction technique through which the number of features for classification is reduced aiming at an optimal classification of text document.",,978-1-4244-5585-0,978-1-4244-5586-7,10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5451965,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451965,Feature Reduction;Feature Selection;Naïve Bayes;Rough sets;Text Mining,Computer science;Data mining;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Probability;Rough sets;Set theory;Testing;Text mining,Bayes methods;classification;data mining;information retrieval;probability;rough set theory;text analysis,feature reduction;hybrid text mining model;information retrieval;naive Bayes;probabilistic value;rough set theory;text document classification;training document;word probability,,1,,22,,,26-28 Feb. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Along with new techniques such as SDN come lots of new network security challenges. Conventional network security mechanisms are incompetent to overcome these challenges, since they are built on a static network configuration that facilitates attackers in finding the weaknesses of a network. In this article, we conceive a novel conceptual network security mechanism, the evolving defense mechanism (EDM), to resolve current and future security problems. EDM is based on a bio-inspired idea of network configuration variations. According to the security requirements of the system, the user, and the network security state, EDM selects an efficient network configuration variation strategy to prevent corresponding security threats. Combined with SDN implementation, EDM resolves security problems from a new angle and is capable of evolving with new network security technology. We sketch a way to implement EDM and present its reference framework, which serves as an ecosystem and coexisting environment for various kinds of network configuration variations.

However, user credentials can be stolen and an attacker (using a stolen credential) can masquerade as the legitimate user and penetrate the system as an insider. This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen.

The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then use our vulnerability metric to evaluate a data structure which is commonly used in network mechanisms-the Hash table data structure. We show that Closed Hash is much more vulnerable to DDoS attacks than Open Hash, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent by traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queuing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Furthermore, we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2012.49,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158635,Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;DDoS;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers;hash;malicious;metric;queue;vulnerability,Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers,Internet;computer network security;cryptography,DDoS attacks;Distributed Denial of Service attacks;Internet;closed hash;computer-network designs;hash table data structure;malicious users;network mechanism vulnerability;open hash;queuing mechanisms;vulnerability metric,,2,,26,,2/27/2012,May-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Accordingly, we pose the evaluation and the deployment problems; the former is to evaluate the new coverage measure of a given sensor network, and the latter is to find an optimal placement of k additional sensor nodes to improve the coverage for a given positive integer k. We present several algorithms solving the problems that are either centralized or localized with theoretical proofs and simulation results, showing that our algorithms are efficient and easy to implement in practice while the quality of outputs is guaranteed by formal proofs.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information.

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field.

Scalable NIDS via Negative Pattern Matching and Exclusive Pattern Matching,"Kai Zheng; Xin Zhang; Zhiping Cai; Wang, Z.; Baohua Yang","Res.

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152,,Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils,content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data,NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories,,1,,12,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata,"Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-9919-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986,Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching,NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,,11,,26,,,10-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as ""it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal"" can be integrated in classification tasks.

Scalable Solutions of Markov Games for Smart-Grid Infrastructure Protection,"Ma, C.Y.T.; Yau, D.K.Y.; Rao, N.S.V.","Adv. Digital Sci.

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.",1949-3053,,,10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437,Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks,Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids,Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids,Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter,,2,,32,,2/7/2013,Mar-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

IEEE 6th International Conference on",20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",,978-1-4244-5113-5,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections.

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo.

Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode.

Most existing approaches have focused on intrusion detection and post-attack responses in a similar fashion to fault detection and recovery. However, attack behaviors are much more complex and less predictable than fault behaviors as an attacker often changes his course of actions during the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach that can incorporate behaviors of attackers into the decision analysis of security management. This is especially crucial as attackers can keep advancing their techniques to outsmart security technologies. Our research aims to enhance the science of security that enables behavioral modeling as well as model extensibility.

MPC: Mitigating Stealthy Power Control Attacks in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks,"Khalil, I.","Coll. of Inf. Technol., United Arab Emirates Univ., Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates","Global Telecommunications Conference, 2009. GLOBECOM 2009. IEEE",20100304,2009,,,1,6,"Local monitoring has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for mitigating security attacks in multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality. We show through analysis and simulation that the basic local monitoring (BLM) fails to efficiently mitigate stealthy power control attacks while MPC successfully mitigates them.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-4148-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425559,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425559,,Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power control;Protocols;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless sensor networks,ad hoc networks;power control;protocols;security of data;wireless channels,MPC;basic local monitoring;malicious behavior;mitigating security attacks;mitigating stealthy power control attacks;multihop ad-hoc networks;partial neighborhood communication;protocol;stealthy packet dropping;wireless ad hoc networks,,0,,18,,,Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
SIMD parallelization of applications that traverse irregular data structures,"Ren, B.; Agrawal, G.; Larus, J.R.; Mytkowicz, T.; Poutanen, T.; Schulte, W.","Dept. of Comput.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.",,978-1-4673-5524-7,,10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989,Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD,Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation,data structures;optimisation;parallel programming,SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach,,1,,37,,,23-27 Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

In response, ShanghaiGrid (SG) aims to providing abundant information services to the public. With fixed schedule and urban-wide coverage, an appealing service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to the public using buses, which allows mobile device users to send messages to locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in realizing this service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside adversaries.

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming.

We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations.

Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall ""network behavior"" of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored.

In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM.

The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies.

Testing the effects of recency and inertia on cyber threat detection through Instance-Based Learning,"Reddy, R.; Kanaparthi, B.R.; Dutt, V.","Sch. of Comput. & Electr.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.",,978-1-4673-4527-9,,10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428,Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency,Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model,computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence),IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency,,0,,10,,,22-23 Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.",,,,10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240,Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection,Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training,Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data,Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access,,0,,19,,,19-20 Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

To better defend these PoIs, the design of the bistatic radar network is investigated in two stages. First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.",1536-1276,,,10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889,Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game,Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors,,,,0,,21,,1/22/2013,Mar-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations.

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle.

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling.

The intruder, on the other hand, would like to enter this sensitive part of the network and wants to spend as much time there as possible. The state of the intruder evolves in discrete time; also there are a limited number of opportunities for the security system to make state observations over the finite horizon of the problem. This model can be used to capture the essence of intrusion detection in a variety of situations such as hackers in a network or physical intruders in a spatial area where there is a constraint on the number of observations one may make due to power limitations.

Scalable matching and ranking for network search,"Uddin, M.; Stadler, R.; Clemm, A.","ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH R.

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

On using multiple classifier systems for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) anomaly detection,"Mehta, A.; Hantehzadeh, N.; Gurbani, V.K.; Tin Kam Ho; Sander, F.",,"Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on",20121129,2012,,,1101,1106,"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an important multimedia session establishment protocol used on the Internet. It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.",1550-3607,978-1-4577-2052-9,978-1-4577-2051-2,10.1109/ICC.2012.6364010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364010,,Accuracy;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms;Vectors,Internet;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;unsupervised learning,Euclidean distance classifier;Internet;SIP message;anomaly detection;feature reduction measurement;machine learning algorithm;message malforming;multimedia session establishment protocol;multiple classifier system;self-learning system;session initiation protocol;text-based protocol,,0,,27,,,10-15 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Privacy Preserving Collaborative Enforcement of Firewall Policies in Virtual Private Networks,"Liu, A.X.; Fei Chen","Dept. of Comput.

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN tunnel. To address this issue, we propose VGuard, a framework that allows a policy owner and a request owner to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy without the policy owner knowing the request and the request owner knowing the policy. We first present an efficient protocol, called Xhash, for oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, without disclosing their numbers to each other. Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of VGuard is to first convert a firewall policy to nonoverlapping numerical rules and then use Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. Comparing with the Cross-Domain Cooperative Firewall (CDCF) framework, which represents the state-of-the-art, VGuard is not only more secure but also orders of magnitude more efficient.

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks.

A Passivity Framework for Modeling and Mitigating Wormhole Attacks on Networked Control Systems,"Lee, P.; Clark, A.; Bushnell, L.; Poovendran, R.","Dept. of Electr.

The use of an open wireless medium and unattended deployment leaves these systems vulnerable to intelligent adversaries whose goal is to disrupt the system performance. In this paper, we study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary establishes a link between two geographically distant regions of the network by using either high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing constraints of real-time control systems by first creating low-latency links, which attract network traffic, and then delaying or dropping packets. Since the wormhole attack reroutes and replays valid messages, it cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling and mitigating the wormhole attack. We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. By integrating existing mitigation strategies into our framework, we analyze the throughput, delay, and stability properties of the overall system. Through simulation study, we show that, by selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the physical system.",0018-9286,,,10.1109/TAC.2014.2351871,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882790,Cyber-physical systems;networked control systems;passivity;wireless networks;wormhole attack,Cryptography;Delays;Networked control systems;Resource management;Routing;Silicon,computer network security;cryptography;delays;networked control systems;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN,cryptographic mechanisms;delay constraints;network flows;network traffic;networked control systems;packet delays;passivity framework;wireless network;wormhole attacks,,1,,19,,8/28/2014,Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

In this study, we propose a simple and uniform framework for the assessment of security, availability, and reliability that arbitrary compositions of security measures can provide. Our methodology facilitates system modeling in a decision-theoretic manner, which makes the models easily understandable even for specialists from fields other than security.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.",1550-3607,978-1-4577-2052-9,978-1-4577-2051-2,10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985,,Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement,Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic,Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering,,0,,13,,,10-15 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

This extended model can be configured to reach a wide variety of different security goals. Particularly, it allows for information flow checking based on users and/or programs dependent policy rules. Furthermore, suspicious modification of binary programs can be detected to avoid malware execution.

Scalable multi-pipeline architecture for high performance multi-pattern string matching,"Weirong Jiang; Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.",1530-2075,978-1-4244-6442-5,,10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374,DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching,Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput,field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching,Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture,,2,,21,,,19-23 April 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

In dynamic and decentralized settings where the traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents. In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information.

Within this framework, it becomes possible to quantify, e.g., the robustness of a user's proof of authorization to possible perturbations in the system, how close an unauthorized user is to satisfying a particular policy, and relative “top-k” style rankings of the best users to carry out a particular task. To this end, we explore several interesting classes of scoring functions for assessing the robustness of authorization decisions, and develop criteria under which these types of functions can be composed with one another.

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade.

Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential.

This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks.

Zigzag: Partial mutual revocation based trust management in tactical ad hoc networks,"Xin Chen; Patankar, H.; Sencun Zhu; Srivatsa, M.; Opper, J.","Dept. of Comput.

To achieve these goals, several papers have explored the concept of mutual revocation (sometimes termed suicide) wherein the trust value of both the accuser and the accused node are temporarily set to zero without involving a quorum. In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.",,,,10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971,Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management,Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors,ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing,Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority,,1,,18,,,24-27 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

The common method used to rank the alerts is scoring function, the higher the score, the more risky of the alert. Our motivation is that many times, user can not precisely specify the weights for the scoring function as their preference in order to get the preferable Ranking.

Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies.

Bypassing Space Explosion in High-Speed Regular Expression Matching,"Patel, J.; Liu, A.X.; Torng, E.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20141218,2014,22,6,1701,1714,"Network intrusion detection and prevention systems commonly use regular expression (RE) signatures to represent individual security threats. While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms.

Enforcement of Security Properties for Dynamic MAC Policies,"Briffaut, J.; Lalande, J.-F.; Toinard, C.; Blanc, M.","LIFO - EA 4022, ENSI de Bourges, Bourges, France","Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies, 2009. SECURWARE '09. Third International Conference on",20090821,2009,,,114,120,"This paper focuses on the enforcement of security properties fitting with dynamic mandatory access control policies. It adds complementary results to previous works of the authors in order to better address dynamic policies. Previous works of the authors provide several advances for enforcing the security of MAC system.An administration language for formalizing a large set of security properties is available to system administrators. That language uses several flow operators and ease the formalization of the required security properties. A solution is also available for computing the possible violations of any security property that can be formalized using our language. That solution computes several flow graphs in order to find all the allowed activities that can violate the requested properties. That paper addresses remaining problems related to the enforcement of the same kind of properties but with dynamic MAC policies. Enforcement is more much complex if we consider dynamic policies since the states of those policies are theoretically infinite. A new approach is proposed for dynamic MAC policies. The major idea is to use a meta-policy language for controlling the allowed evolutions of those dynamic policies. According to those meta-policy constraints, the computation problem becomes easier. The proposed solution adds meta-nodes within the considered flow graphs. A general algorithm is given for computing the required meta-nodes and the associated arcs. The proposed meta-graphs provide an overestimation of the possible flows between the different meta-nodes. The computation of the possible violations within the allowed dynamic policies is thus allowed. Several concrete security properties are considered using regular expressions for identifying the requested meta-contexts. The resulting violations, within the allowed meta-graphs, are computed and real violations are presented.",,978-0-7695-3668-2,,10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211030,,Access control;Concrete;Flow graphs;Information security;Linux;Mechanical factors;Operating systems;Permission;Protection;Safety,authorisation;graph theory;telecommunication security,dynamic mandatory access control policies;flow graphs;meta-policy constraints;security properties fitting,,0,,16,,,18-23 June 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
Decompression-free inspection: DPI for shared dictionary compression over HTTP,"Bremler-Barr, A.; David, S.T.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Interdiscipl. Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,1987,1995,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576,,Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers,Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols,Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression,,2,,25,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Variants of malware and exploits are emerging on the global canvas at an ever-increasing rate. There is a need to automate their detection by observing their malicious footprints over network streams. In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets. This technique is then evaluated using a large dataset and the correctness of the classifier is verified by using `area under the receiver operating characteristic curves'(ROC AUC) measures across various string metric-based classifiers.,1930-529X,978-1-4673-0920-2,978-1-4673-0919-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503226,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503226,,,invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence),honeynets;machine learning method;malicious footprints;malicious network streams;malware;misuse based intrusion detection system;receiver operating characteristic curves measures;security threats;string metric based classifiers,,2,,16,,,3-7 Dec. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
