However, the training and testing time to build the model is very high. To address this, we proposed feature selection based on information gain, which can contribute to detect several attack types with high accurate result and low false rate.

An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule.

In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed.

The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold.

This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible.

Towards an Information-Theoretic Approach for Measuring Intelligent False Alarm Reduction in Intrusion Detection,Yuxin Meng; Lam-for Kwok,"Dept. of Comput.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.",,,,10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847,Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection,Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement,information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation,,1,,24,,,16-18 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

Thus, it is of paramount importance to protect the networks from attackers. Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT.

Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer.

We use the bus nodes as the cluster-heads to gather the routing control messages and data packets transmitted among the vehicles. The bus nodes first transmit the original network behavior information to the access points deployed along the road sides.

But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks.

Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task.

To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done.

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment.

In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns.

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way.

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal.

Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined.

A Novel Framework of Dynamic Learning Based Intrusion Detection Approach in MANET,"Shirbhate, S.V.; Sherekar, S.S.; Thakare, V.M.",,"Computing Communication Control and Automation (ICCUBEA), 2015 International Conference on",20150716,2015,,,209,213,"With the growth of security and surveillance system, a huge amount of audit or network data is being generated. It is immense challenge for researcher to protect the mobile ad hoc network from the malicious node as topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious node can easily inject false routes into the network. A traditional method to detect such malicious nodes is to establish a base profile of normal network behavior and then identify a node's behavior to be anomalous if it deviates from the established profile. As the topology of a MANET constantly changes over time, the simple use of a static base profile is not efficient. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to detect the malicious node in MANET. In proposed method k-means clustering-based anomaly detection approach is used in which the profile is dynamically updated. The approach consists of three main phases: training, testing and updating. In training phase, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in order to establish a normal profile. In testing phase, check whether the current traffic of the node is normal or anomalous. If it is normal then update the normal profile otherwise isolate the malicious node and ignore that node from the network. To update the normal profile periodically, weighted coefficients and a forgetting equation is used.",,,,10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.46,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155836,Dynamic Intrusion Detection System;K-means clustering;MANET,Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Testing;Training,mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,MANET;anomaly detection approach;dynamic learning;intrusion detection approach;k-means clustering;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc network;network data;novel framework;security system;static base profile;surveillance system;topology node,,0,,16,,,26-27 Feb. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Opportunistic Adversaries: On Imminent Threats to Learning-Based Business Automation,"Tatsubori, M.; Hido, S.","IBM Res. - Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","SRII Global Conference (SRII), 2012 Annual",20120924,2012,,,120,129,"False positives and negatives are inevitable in real-world classification problems. In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"".

Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability.

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.",,978-1-4673-6320-4,,10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581,,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training,Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection,Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction,,0,,20,,,19-21 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.",,978-1-4799-7324-8,,10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469,Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward,Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles,access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks,MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection,,0,,19,,,4-8 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks.

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network.

Runtime Defense against Code Injection Attacks Using Replicated Execution,"Salamat, B.; Jackson, T.; Wagner, G.; Wimmer, C.; Franz, M.","Qualcomm, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110519,2011,8,4,588,601,"The number and complexity of attacks on computer systems are increasing. This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks.

Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal.

Architecture for evaluating and correlating NIDS in real - World networks,"Koch, R.; Golling, M.","Fac. of Comput.

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated.

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.",0742-1303,978-1-4673-1565-4,,10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689,Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models,Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis,autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols,DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks,,0,,47,,,22-25 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy.

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties.

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.",,978-1-4799-5062-1,,10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823,Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen,Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization,cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines,IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection,,0,,26,,,June 27 2014-July 2 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

However, there is a weak anomaly detection problem among the existing system call based intrusion detection systems: the pattern value range of abnormal system call sequences generated by attacks always overlaps to that by normal behaviors so it is difficult to accurately classify the sequences falling into the overlap area by a unique threshold. Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.",,978-1-4799-2763-0,,10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958,Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training,computer network security;pattern classification,TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation,,0,,16,,,16-18 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general.

Log files are generated from servers and network devices to record operations that occur in the computers and networks. As log files are too enormous to manualize, we develop a tool to maximize accuracy as well as efficiency while high speed processing is the goal. Firstly, we must improve the accuracy by using learning algorithms to classify the normal operations from the abnormal ones such algorithms include tf-idf, association rules, k-means clustering, and decision tree. Secondly, we may adapt for less accuracy in order to gain speed for both with and/or without parallel processing techniques. We also construct an adaptive learning algorithm to update the model.

Towards dynamic self-tuning for intrusion detection systems,"Sun-il Kim; Nwanze, N.; Kintner, J.","Electr. & Comput. Syst.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs.

One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier,"Al Naqshbandi, S.M.; Samawi, V.W.","Tilburg centre for Cognition & Commun., Tilburg Univ., Tilburg, Netherlands","Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE), 2012 IEEE International Conference on",20120820,2012,2,,204,208,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the widely used tools for defending computer networks. Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic.

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic.

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden layer. We investigate the use of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in optimizing interconnection weights of a MLP network. Our proposed GSA-based flow anomaly detection system (GFADS) is trained with a flow-based data set. The trained system can classify benign and malicious flows with 99.43% accuracy.

Prediction of normal and abnormal request is problematic due to large number of false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems (IDS). SS-IDS derives automatically the parameter profiles from the analyzed data thereby generating the statistical signatures. Statistical signatures are based on modeling of normal requests and their distribution value without explicit intervention. Several attributes are used to calculate the behavior of the legitimate request on the web server. SS-IDS is best suited for the newly installed web servers which doesnpsilat have large number of requests in the data set to train the IDS and can be used on top of currently used signature based IDS like SNORT.

The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality.

A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack.

Network level attack detection solutions focus on the information in the headers of network packets.

By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them.

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., “Atak” worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms.

An Intrusion Detection Architecture for Clustered Wireless Ad Hoc Networks,"Sen, J.","Innovation Lab., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Kolkata, India","Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks (CICSyN), 2010 Second International Conference on",20101101,2010,,,202,207,"Intrusion detection in wireless ad hoc networks is a challenging task because these networks change their topologies dynamically, lack concentration points where aggregated traffic can be analyzed, utilize infrastructure protocols that are susceptible to manipulation, and rely on noisy, intermittent wireless communications. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection.

How to detect cloned tags in a reliable way from incomplete RFID traces,"Lehtonen, M.; Michahelles, F.; Fleisch, E.","Inf.

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.",,978-1-4244-3337-7,978-1-4244-3338-4,10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190,,Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management,probability;radiofrequency identification,RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain,,7,5,23,,,27-28 April 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

IEEE 6th International Conference on",20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",,978-1-4244-5113-5,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes.

Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection,Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou,"Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat. Central Univ., Jungli, Taiwan","World Telecommunications Congress (WTC), 2012",20120315,2012,,,1,6,"Accompanied by the invention of information and communication of technologies, e-government has become a prominent feature of modern governance in every country. The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.",,978-1-4577-1459-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432,,Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training,Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing,CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs,,1,,18,,,5-6 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters.

Many of the existing approaches either are rigid, inflexible designs tailored to a specific situation or require manual setting of design parameters such as the initial number of clusters. In this paper we allow the design parameters to be determined dynamically by adopting a layered hybrid architecture, hence resolving the aforementioned shortcomings. The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user.

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%.

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives.

Specifically,we introduce a set of measurements that characterize the potential costs associated with the intrusion handling process, and propose an intrusion response evaluation method with respect to the risk of potential intrusion damage, the effectiveness of the response action and the response cost for a system.

Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats.

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection.

We demonstrate that our approach can achieve greater accuracy in non-homogeneous sensing environments than existing methods, while achieving low communication and computational overhead in the network.",,978-1-4244-3517-3,978-1-4244-3518-0,10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416818,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416818,,Base stations;Computer science;Costs;Ellipsoids;Event detection;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Software engineering;Wireless sensor networks,distributed algorithms;wireless sensor networks,anomaly detection;clustering ellipsoids;distributed algorithm;wireless sensor networks,,8,,13,,,7-10 Dec. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Exhaust: Optimizing Wu-Manber pattern matching for intrusion detection using Bloom filters,"Aldwairi, M.; Al-Khamaiseh, K.","Coll. of Technol.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.",,978-1-4799-8171-7,,10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081,Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber,Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads,data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data,Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems,,0,,19,,,21-23 March 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Traditional hardware solutions are intended for firewall routers. However, the solutions in the literature for firewalls are not scalable, and they do not address the difficulty of an antivirus with an ever-larger pattern set. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory.

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235,,Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols,Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes,DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol,,21,,15,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naïve Bayes classification scheme.

Mobile ad hoc networks do not use any predefined infrastructure during the communication so that all the present mobile nodes which are want to communicate with each other immediately form the topology and initiates the request for data packets to send or receive. In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s). This paper developed an anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system to detect the packet dropping attack from mobile ad hoc networks and this proposed solution also save the resources of mobile nodes in respect to remove the malicious nodes. For implementation point of view, qualnet simulator 6.1 and sugeno-type fuzzy inference system are used to make the fuzzy rule base for analyzing the results.

A Biologically Modeled Intrusion Detection System for Mobile Networks,"Williams, B.C.; Fulp, E.W.","Dept. of Comput.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup.

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance.

Collaborative architecture for distributed intrusion detection system,"Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can deliver satisfactory system performance with less network load.",,978-1-4244-3763-4,978-1-4244-3764-1,10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356567,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356567,,Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis,security of data,DARPA dataset;attack tools;collaborative architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;network technologies;noncentral analyzer;one-level hierarchy dIDS;security,,3,,31,,,8-10 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"".

The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods.

This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood.

The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS.

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration.

Collabra: A Xen Hypervisor Based Collaborative Intrusion Detection System,"Bharadwaja, S.; Weiqing Sun; Niamat, M.; Fangyang Shen","Univ. of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA","Information Technology: New Generations (ITNG), 2011 Eighth International Conference on",20110711,2011,,,695,700,"In this paper, we introduce Collabra, a distributed intrusion detection platform based on Xen hyper visors to maintain the security of the cloud based on virtualized network. While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.",,978-1-61284-427-5,978-0-7695-4367-3,10.1109/ITNG.2011.123,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321,cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine,Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors,application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks,Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network,,10,,24,,,11-13 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.",1751-8822,,,10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380,,,CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance,BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate,,0,,,,,5 2015,,IET,IET Journals & Magazines,,,

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths.

Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output.

High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling,"Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly.

To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections.

However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process.

Performance Evaluation of Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS for MANET,"Agrawal, A.; Patidar, M.; Sharma, M.K.","Dept. of CSE, SIMS, Indore, India","IT in Business, Industry and Government (CSIBIG), 2014 Conference on",20150312,2014,,,1,6,"MANET is an infrastructure less network and can work without any devices dependencies. These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues.

MKL methods combined with support vector machines (SVMs) can overcome some practice difficulties of IDS such as irregular data, non-flat distribution of the samples, etc. Experiments on the KDD Cup (1999) intrusion detection data set show that MKL methods have a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate compared to single kernel methods.",,978-1-4244-6791-4,,10.1109/ISKE.2010.5680860,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680860,Intrusion Detection System;feature selection;kernel method;multiple kernel learning;support vector machine,Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines,learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines,SVM;data representation;intrusion detection system;kernel learning method;network anomaly detection;support vector machines,,1,,10,,,15-16 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN.

Different from the general server, once the cloud environment suffered from malicious attacks, people or companies will get caught in extreme dangers. Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix. Using the information in Alert Correlation Matrix, we can extract high level attack strategies and construct attack graphs.

An automatic portscan detection system with adaptive threshold setting,"Kim, Sang Kon; Lee, Seung Ho; Seo, Seung Woo","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science &#x0026; Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Korea","Communications and Networks, Journal of",20121220,2010,12,1,74,85,"For the purpose of compromising hosts, attackers including infected hosts initially perform a portscan using IP addresses in order to find vulnerable hosts. Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners.

Accelerating snort NIDS using NetFPGA-based Bloom filter,"Al-Dalky, R.; Salah, K.; Otrok, H.; Al-Qutayri, M.","Electr. & Comput. Eng.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer.

In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol.

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).",1550-6002,978-1-4244-8078-4,978-0-7695-4131-0,10.1109/QSIC.2010.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949,Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression,Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing,computer network security;program testing,IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing,,3,,21,,,14-15 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

IDSs play an important role in monitoring traffic behaviors in a computer network, identifying the anomalous activity and notifying the security analyst with current network status. Unfortunately, one of the IDSs' drawbacks is they produce a large number of false positives and non-relevant positives alerts that could overwhelm the security analyst. Therefore, the process of analyzing alerts in order to provide a more synthetic and high-level view of the attempted intrusions is needed. This process is called Alert Correlation.

To understand the interplay underlying this problem, we formulate a Bayesian model, where the IDS faces a scanning allocation dilemma: if the intruder has no knowledge, then all the bands are under equal threat, while if the intruder has complete knowledge, then less-protected bands are more likely to be threatened. We solve this dilemma and show the optimal IDS strategy switches between the optimal response to these threats.

We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant.

Port scanning detection has received a lot of attention by researchers. However a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we present a new, simple, and efficient method for detecting slow port scans. Our proposed method is mainly composed of two phases: (1) a feature collection phase that analyzes network traffic and extracts the features needed to classify a certain IP as malicious or not. (2) A classification phase that divides the IPs, based on the collected features, into three groups: normal IPs, suspicious IPs and scanner IPs. The IPs our approach classify as suspicious are kept for the next (K) time windows for further examination to decide whether they represent scanners or legitimate users. Hence, this approach is different than the traditional approach used by IDSs that classifies IPs as either legitimate or scanners, and thus producing a high number of false positives and false negatives. A small Local Area Network was put together to test our proposed method. The experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method in correctly identifying malicious scanners when both normal and slow port scan were performed using the three most common TCP port scanning techniques.

DNS-IDS: Securing DNS in the Cloud Era,"Satam, Pratik; Alipour, Hamid; Al-Nashif, Youssif; Hariri, Salim",,"Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC), 2015 International Conference on",20151029,2015,,,296,301,"Recently, there has been a rapid growth in cloud computing due to their ability to offer computing and storage on demand, its elasticity, and significant reduction in operational costs. However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.",,,,10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172,Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training,Cloud computing,,,,,,,,,21-25 Sept. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.",,978-1-4244-2769-7,,10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096,,Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning,graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data,Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory,,0,,23,,,March 30 2009-April 2 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
Robust Correlation of Encrypted Attack Traffic through Stepping Stones by Flow Watermarking,"Xinyuan Wang; Reeves, D.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110314,2011,8,3,434,449,"Network-based intruders seldom attack their victims directly from their own computer. Often, they stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones” in order to conceal their identity and origin. To identify the source of the attack behind the stepping stone(s), it is necessary to correlate the incoming and outgoing flows or connections of a stepping stone. To resist attempts at correlation, the attacker may encrypt or otherwise manipulate the connection traffic. Timing-based correlation approaches have been shown to be quite effective in correlating encrypted connections. However, timing-based correlation approaches are subject to timing perturbations that may be deliberately introduced by the attacker at stepping stones. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based-correlation scheme that is designed specifically to be robust against timing perturbations. Unlike most previous timing-based correlation approaches, our watermark-based approach is “active” in that it embeds a unique watermark into the encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. The unique watermark that is embedded in the encrypted flow gives us a number of advantages over passive timing-based correlation in resisting timing perturbations by the attacker. In contrast to the existing passive correlation approaches, our active watermark-based correlation does not make any limiting assumptions about the distribution or random process of the original interpacket timing of the packet flow. In theory, our watermark-based correlation can achieve arbitrarily close to 100 percent correlation true positive rate (TPR), and arbitrarily close to 0 percent false positive rate (FPR) at the same time for sufficiently long flows, despite arbitrarily large (but bounded) timing perturbations of any distribution by the attacker. Our paper is the first that identifies 1) accurate quantitative tradeoffs between the achievable correlation effectiveness - nd the defining characteristics of the timing perturbation; and 2) a provable upper bound on the number of packets needed to achieve a desired correlation effectiveness, given the amount of timing perturbation. Experimental results show that our active watermark-based correlation performs better and requires fewer packets than existing, passive timing-based correlation methods in the presence of random timing perturbations.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.35,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551157,Network-level security and protection;correlation;intrusion tracing;stepping stone.,Correlation;Cryptography;Decoding;Delay;Robustness;Watermarking,cryptography;random processes;watermarking,encrypted attack traffic;false positive rate;flow watermarking;network based intruder;random timing perturbation;stepping stones;true positive rate;watermark based correlation scheme,,1,,37,,8/19/2010,May-June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software.

Data preprocessing module is the process of preparing and adjusting the raw data in order to feed into the classification algorithms. Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not.

This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and difference distance map are used for selection of significant features. This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain.

A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching.

In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes.

Event Correlation for Intrusion Detection Systems,"Dwivedi, N.; Tripathi, A.",,"Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), 2015 IEEE International Conference on",20150402,2015,,,133,139,"Intrusion Detection System (IDS) have grown into a mature and feature rich technology that provides advanced features to detect intrusion and provide responses. It also allows the management system for security analysis by monitoring, configuring and analyzing the intrusion data. A better understanding of alerts by using a general framework and infrastructure for detecting intrusions through event correlation strategy minimizes the amount of data generated. Event correlation techniques are needed for two reasons. First, network attack detection is usually based on information or data received from distributed sensors, e.g. intrusion detection systems. During attacks, the generated amount of events is hard to handle and so it is difficult to evaluate the current attack situation for a larger network. Thus, the concept of event or alert correlation has been introduced. Event correlation paints a picture of what is now being called as network or cyber situational awareness and tries to guide the security administrator on the actions that he can take to mitigate the crisis. The aim of the event correlation for intrusion detection system (IDS) is to improve security by correlating events and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. This correlation has been achieved by getting together similar alerts, thus allowing the analyst to only look at a few alerts instead of hundreds or thousands of alerts. In this paper, we correlate the results of SNORT Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with SEC (Simple Event Correlator) by taking the input from the MIT DARPA (Defense advanced Research Projects Agency) dataset. The alerts generated from Snort are very large and so it is difficult for the administrators to identify them. Here we correlate the alerts based on same name coming from different IP address.

A lightweight hybrid security framework for wireless sensor networks,"Sedjelmaci, H.; Senouci, S.M.","DRIVE Lab., Univ. of Bourgogne, Nevers, France","Communications (ICC), 2014 IEEE International Conference on",20140828,2014,,,3636,3641,"On the one hand, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have shown their ability to detect internal and external attacks with a high accuracy. On the other hand, cryptography techniques have proved their ability to assure the privacy of communication, i.e. data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected.

A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX).

IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs.

To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost).

Allowing white spaces to be used in a deregulated manner exposes the radio spectrum to anomalous usage, which in turn may intentionally or unintentionally cause interference to primary users (PUs) as well as secondary users (SUs). In this paper we propose a subspace-based spectrum guarding detector (SSGD) to address the security of unauthorized spectrum usage. In particular, we consider the scenario where ongoing authorized transmissions by PUs have to be preserved from concurrent unauthorized emissions in the same frequency bands. The detector operates in two phases: a training phase where SSGD collects samples of the authorized transmissions, and a detection (on-line) phase where the spectrum is guarded against anomalous emissions. The performance of SSGD is analyzed in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities highlighting the effects of the propagation scenario, the PU characteristics, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the duration of both training and on-line phases.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead.

Dynamic forensics using IDS or honeypot are all based on a common hypothesis that the system is still in a reliable working situation and collected evidences are believable even if the system is suffered from intrusion. In fact, the system has already transferred into an insecurity and unreliable state, it is uncertain that whether the intrusion detectors and investigators could run as normal and whether the obtained evidences are credible. Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics. The work presented in this paper is based on an idea to integrate intrusion tolerance into dynamic forensics to make the system under control, ensure the reliability of evidences and aim to gather more useful evidences for investigation. A mechanism of dynamic forensics based on intrusion forensics is proposed.

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks.

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.",,978-1-4244-8183-5,,10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031,energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network,Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks,principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks,WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks,,2,,14,,,4-6 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

At present the presence of such a potential threat agitates a greater and greater interest in various possibilities for enhancing its security. Currently exerted defence system based on the use of firewall, antivirus software and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) represents a necessary minimum. This traditional approach to security of computer systems is primarily oriented to the defence against already existing threats. It is essential to adapt the security system to this trend as the current threats have much more aggressive forms. The use of decoy based security technology - Honeypot - represents an adequate form of defence. However, even this technology is not a “security panacea” as its 100% functionality is proportionally dependent on the specific installation process. This article is focused on the technology called Honeypot and the issue of implementation process of its autonomous version, which is able to create virtual Honeypots and thus rapidly increase a security level of distributed heterogeneous computer systems.

Among hardware approaches, memory-based architecture has attracted a lot of attention because of its easy reconfigurability and scalability. In order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful network intrusion detection system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set.

We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds.

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means.

With booming number of intruders and hackers in todays vast and sophisticated computerized world, it is unceasingly challenging to identify unknown attacks in promising time with no false positive and no false negative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy.

Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server.

In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS).

Improving cyber-security of smart grid systems via anomaly detection and linguistic domain knowledge,"Linda, O.; Manic, M.; Vollmer, T.","Univ. of Idaho, Idaho Falls, ID, USA","Resilient Control Systems (ISRCS), 2012 5th International Symposium on",20120924,2012,,,48,54,"The planned large scale deployment of smart grid network devices will generate a large amount of information exchanged over various types of communication networks. The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack.

By interacting with a system, an insider plays games with the security mechanisms employed to protect it. We apply game theory to model these interactions in an extensive form game, that is being played repeatedly with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The outcomes of the game are quantified by specifying players' preferences and by assigning numbers to reflect these preferences. Examining players' best responses, the solution of the game follows by locating all the Nash Equilibria (NE). We extend the NE notion to the logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), to capture players' bounded rationality. The QRE results are more realistic and show that the solution of the game might be significantly different than the corresponding NE solution.

DFA-Based Regular Expression Matching on Compressed Traffic,Yan Sun; Min Sik Kim,"Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on",20110728,2011,,,1,5,"Many network security applications in today's networks are based on deep packet inspection, checking not only the header portion but also the payload portion of a packet. For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system.

Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the “normal behavior DNA sequence” through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed.

In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naïve Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.",,,,10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918792,Classification;Data Pre-processing;Feature Selection;Malware Detection,Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic,data mining;feature selection;invasive software,FP rate;IDS;RA attribute;TP rate;UCI KDD CUP;Weka data mining;chi squared attribute;consistency subset;correlation feature selection;feature selection techniques;filtered attribute;filtered subset evaluation;gain ratio attribute;information gain attribute;intrusion detection system;machine learning tool;malware detection;network traffic dataset,,0,,21,,,21-23 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character. We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.",,978-1-4244-5334-4,978-0-7695-3823-5,10.1109/CSE.2009.149,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168,anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain,Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems,data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data,anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics,,0,,28,,,29-31 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Malware Clearance for Secure Commitment of OS-Level Virtual Machines,Zhiyong Shan; Xin Wang; Tzi-Cker Chiueh,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20130307,2013,10,2,70,83,"A virtual machine(VM) can be simply created upon use and disposed upon the completion of the tasks or the detection of error. The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2012.88,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643,Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment,Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining,invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines,OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping,,1,,39,,11/30/2012,March-April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

None has focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time.

Existing IDPSs do not seem to provide a satisfactory method of achieving these two conflicting goals. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications.

As with any computer application, installation of a Trojan leaves a ldquofootprintrdquo on the systems resources. However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems.

Proposed Intrusion Detection on ZRP based MANET by effective k-means clustering method of data mining,"Sumit, S.; Mitra, D.; Gupta, D.","Dept. of CSE/IT, Manipal Univ.

As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network.

An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis,"Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual",20100115,2009,,,494,503,"Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.",1063-9527,978-0-7695-3919-5,,10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706,intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty,Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty,inference mechanisms;security of data,Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty,,3,,22,,,7-11 Dec. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS).

A Watchdog extension scheme considering packet loss for a reputation system in wireless mesh network,"Dromard, J.; Khatoun, R.; Khoukhi, L.","Troyes Univ. of Technol., Troyes, France","Telecommunications (ICT), 2013 20th International Conference on",20131017,2013,,,1,5,"Most trust and reputation systems in wireless mesh networks are based on the intrusion detection system (IDS) Watchdog. This IDS enables nodes to detect whether their next node on a path flow forwards correctly packets or not by overhearing its transmissions. However, as Watchdog does not consider the packet loss ratio, it can lead to false positives. Indeed, a node can accuse another node of misbehaving whereas in reality it suffers from link loss. In order to overcome this issue, we propose an extension scheme to the Watchdog IDS which enables a node to determine whether it does not overhear its next node due to packet loss issue or due to misbehavior. To reach this goal, we assume that malicious nodes drop both acknowledgements and forwarded packets with different frequencies. Thus, our scheme compares the distribution of a node's acknowledgment with its distribution of forwarded packets of data to detect misbehaving nodes. Furthermore, we extend our scheme so that it enables a node to monitor both its next node and its previous node on a flow path.",,978-1-4673-6425-6,,10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632124,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632124,,Mobile computing;Multiaccess communication;Packet loss;Random variables;Vectors;Wireless mesh networks,security of data;trusted computing;wireless mesh networks,Watchdog IDS;Watchdog extension;intrusion detection system;link loss;malicious nodes;packet loss;reputation system;trust system;wireless mesh network,,1,,11,,,6-8 May 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training.

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms.

An Adaptive Growing Hierarchical Self Organizing Map for Network Intrusion Detection,"Ippoliti, D.; Xiaobo Zhou","Dept. of Comput.

However, existing approaches based on GHSOM are not able to adapt online to the ever-changing problem domain of network intrusion. This results in low accuracy in identifying network intrusions, particularly ""unknown"" attacks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive GHSOM based approach (A-GHSOM) to network intrusion detection. It consists of four significant enhancements: enhanced threshold-based training, dynamic input normalization, feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation, and prediction confidence filtering and forwarding. We test the capability of the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD'99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying ""unknown"" attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates.

In this paper we address this issue by investigating effective solutions to automatically identify compromised machines in a network. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised.

For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels.

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing.

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences.

The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system.

In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic.

The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS).

An important issue that has not been well studied so far is the selection of normal training data for network anomaly detection algorithm, which is highly related to the detection performance and computational complexity. Based on our previous proposed TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) anomaly detection method, which can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false positive rate, we develop an instance selection mechanism for TCM-KNN based on EFCM (Extended Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm in this paper, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of TCM-KNN and boosting its detection performance.

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative.

In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine.

A novel adaptive intrusion detection approach based on comparison of neural networks and idiotypic networks,Linhui Zhao; Xin Fang; Yaping Dai,"Sch. of Mechatron., Beijing Union Univ., Beijing, China","Nonlinear Dynamics and Synchronization, 2009. INDS '09. 2nd International Workshop on",20090901,2009,,,203,208,"Although neural networks and idiotypic networks are similar in functions, they are different in many aspects. This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.",1866-7791,978-1-4244-3844-0,,10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228006,idiotypic networks;intrusion detection;neural networks;pattern recognition,Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Learning systems;Mechatronics;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Pattern recognition,multilayer perceptrons;security of data,Fisher Iris dataset;KDD-CUP-99 database;adaptive detection approach;adaptive intrusion detection approach;antigens;idiotypic networks;initializing ways;learning methods;multilayer perception network;neural networks;pattern recognition technology;topological structures,,5,,11,,,20-21 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Moreover, it is very difficult to find a real origin of attackers because DoS/DDoS attacker uses spoofed IP addresses. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic route selection algorithm to trace the attacker's real origin. This algorithm uses three types of packets such as an alert packet, an agent packet and a reply agent packet. The alert packet is in use to notify to a victim that DDoS attacks occur. The agent packet is in use to find the attacker's real origin and the reply agent packet is in use to notify to a victim that the agent packet is reached the edge router of the attacker. When source-end detector and victim-end detector detect attacks, the victim-end detector sends the alert packet to the victim. The victim received the alert packet generates the agent packet and sends it to a victim's edge router. The attacker's edge router received the agent packet generates the reply agent packet and send it to the victim. The agent packet and the reply agent packet is forwarded refer to probabilistic packet forwarding table by routers. The probabilistic route selection algorithm runs on the distributed routers and probabilistic packet forwarding table is stored and managed by routers.

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates.

When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s.

Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data.

An optimal filter is then designed for the purpose of detection. We show that using a Wavelet Transform (WT), the colored noise with complex Power Spectral Density (PSD) in our case can be approximately whitened. Since a larger Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate, the SNR is maximized by analyzing the signal at specific frequency ranges.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods.

Layered Higher Order N-grams for Hardening Payload Based Anomaly Intrusion Detection,"Hubballi, N.; Biswas, S.; Nandi, S.","Dept. of Comput.

ARES '10 International Conference on",20100325,2010,,,321,326,Application based intrusion detection involves analysis of network packet payload data. Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching.

To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform.

An effective network-based Intrusion Detection using Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm augmented with near-deterministic detector generation,"Senhua Yu; Dasgupta, D.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA","Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security (CICS), 2011 IEEE Symposium on",20110711,2011,,,17,24,"The Human Immune System (HIS) employs multilevel defense against harmful and unseen pathogens through innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step.

Redundancy Management of Multipath Routing for Intrusion Tolerance in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Al-Hamadi, H.; Ing-Ray Chen","Dept. of Comput.

The key concept of our redundancy management is to exploit the tradeoff between energy consumption vs. the gain in reliability, timeliness, and security to maximize the system useful lifetime. We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized.

Driven by the miniaturization and integration of sensing, communication, and computation in cost-efficient devices, CPSs are bound to transform industries such as aerospace, transportation, built environments, energy, health care, and manufacturing, to name a few. This great opportunity, unfortunately, is matched by even greater challenges. Taming the complexity of design and analysis of these systems poses a fundamental problem as a new paradigm is needed to bridge various scientific domains, which, through the years, have developed significantly different formalisms and methodologies. In addition, while the use of dedicated communication networks has so far sheltered systems from the outside world, use of off-the-shelf networking and computing, combined with the unattended operation of a plethora of devices, provides several opportunities for malicious entities to inject attacks on CPSs. A wide variety of motivations exists for launching an attack on CPSs, ranging from economic reasons, such as obtaining a financial gain, all the way to terrorism, for instance, threatening an entire population by manipulating life-critical resources. Any attack on safety-critical CPSs may significantly hamper the economy and lead to the loss of human lives. While the threat of attacks on CPSs tends to be underplayed at times, the Stuxnet worm provided a clear example of the possible future to come. This malware, targeting a uranium enriching facility in Iran, managed to reach the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system controlling the centrifuges used in the enrichment process.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2011.59,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881,Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization,Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers,SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation,Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management,,4,,52,,11/15/2011,July-Aug. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

Distributed Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks: An Overlapping Coalition Formation Approach,"Tianyu Wang; Lingyang Song; Zhu Han; Saad, W.","State Key Lab. of Adv. Opt. Commun. Syst. & Networks, Peking Univ., Beijing, China","Communications, IEEE Transactions on",20140919,2014,62,9,3144,3160,"Cooperative spectrum sensing has been shown to yield a significant performance improvement in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.",0090-6778,,,10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693,Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing,Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors,cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection,cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user,,0,,37,,8/21/2014,Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources.

In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes.

Signature Tree Generation for Polymorphic Worms,Yong Tang; Bin Xiao; Xicheng Lu,"Coll. of Comput., Nat.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2010.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493,Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation,,digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures,NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering,,7,,36,,6/17/2010,Apr-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

The aim of virtualization is to centralize the information system for facilitating administrative task while improving scalability. Virtualization technology which allows more efficient use of existing physical hardware, as well as some advantages including cost reduction, labor loss and performance improvement, contains several innovations in security, especially in system security. Software applications such as antivirus, firewall, end point security installed on the servers to ensure system security causes performance loss on the network and servers.

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months.

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications.

A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used.

However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods.

International Conference on",20100112,2009,4,,307,311,"This paper dedicates to develop an improved perceptron tree (PT) learning model based intrusion detection approach. The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a Â¿gray boxÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.",,978-1-4244-3835-8,978-0-7695-3816-7,10.1109/AICI.2009.176,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342,decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning,Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons,learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics),binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure,,1,,16,,,7-8 Nov. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series. This method mines structural behavior patterns of the associated graph and detects anomaly traffic through data mining and entropy-based information theoretic techniques.

Eng., Kyung Hee Univ., Yongin, South Korea","Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on",20130731,2013,23,8,1375,1387,"Background modeling is challenging due to background dynamism. Most background modeling methods fail in the presence of intensity changes, because the model cannot handle sudden changes. A solution to this problem is to use intensity-robust features. Despite the changes of an edge's shape and position among frames, edges are less sensitive than a pixel's intensity to illumination changes. Furthermore, background models in the presence of moving objects produce ghosts in the detected output, because high quality models require ideal backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a robust statistical edge-segment-based method for background modeling of non-ideal sequences. The proposed method learns the structure of the scene using the edges' behaviors through the use of kernel-density distributions. Moreover, it uses segment features to overcome the shape and position variations of the edges. Hence, the use of segments gives us local information of the scene, and that helps us to predict the objects and background precisely. Furthermore, we accumulate segments to build edge distributions, which allow us to perform unconstrained training and to overcome the ghost effect. In addition, the proposed method uses adaptive thresholding (in the segments) to detect the moving objects.

Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.",,,,10.1109/TST.2014.6787363,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363,Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid,Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks,,,,1,,,,,Apr-14,,TUP,TUP Journals & Magazines,,,

To protect these networks, intrusion detection systems are used. Signature-based intrusion detection cannot find previously unknown attacks, which is why anomaly detection is needed. However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible.

The overhead network packets can greatly reduce the effectiveness of such detection systems and heavily consume computer resources. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient signature matching algorithm is desirable. In this paper, we therefore develop an adaptive character frequency-based exclusive signature matching scheme that can be implemented in a signature-based NIDS to help improve the performance of signature matching.

The classification is based on the number of file server and mail server attacks observed during a fixed window. The spammer naively attacks (with a known distribution) his main target: the mail server. The spy strategically selects the number of attacks on his main target: the file server. The defender strategically selects his classification policy: a threshold on the number of file server attacks. We model the interaction of the two players (spy and defender) as a nonzero-sum game: The defender needs to balance missed detections and false alarms in his objective function, while the spy has a tradeoff between attacking the file server more aggressively and increasing the chances of getting caught. We give a characterization of the Nash equilibria in mixed strategies, and demonstrate how the Nash equilibria can be computed in polynomial time. Our characterization gives interesting and non-intuitive insights on the players' strategies at equilibrium: The defender uniformly randomizes between a set of thresholds that includes very large values.

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets.

However, with the significant development of network technologies, the current IDS architecture does not support high-speed communications. Therefore, improving the performance of IDS is a major concern for researchers. In this paper, we present a model of intrusion detection based on the classification of network connections. Our approach is based on the principle of an intelligent loss. We propose a classification model based on the principle that a connection is either malicious or not. In the first case, the connection must be handled by the IDS; otherwise we can ignore it. This method reduces significantly the network flow sent to the IDS with a tolerance of an error threshold.

Each new proposal and technique arrives with great promise and anticipated success as research teams struggle to develop new and innovative responses to emerging threats. Unfortunately, these techniques frequently fall short of expectation when deployed due to difficulties with false alarms, trouble operating in a non-idealized or new domain, or flexibility limiting assumptions which are only valid with specific input sets. We believe these failures are due to fundamental problems with the experimental method for evaluating the effectiveness of new ideas and techniques. This work explores the effect of a poorly understood data synthesis process on the evaluation of IA devices. The point of an evaluation is to independently determine what a detector can and cannot detect, i.e. the metric of detection. This can only be done when the data contains carefully controlled ground truth. We broadly define the term “similarity class” to facilitate discussion about the different ways data (and more specifically test data) can be similar, and use these ideas to illustrate the pre-requisites for correct evaluation of anomaly detectors. We focus on how anomaly detectors function and should be evaluated in 2 specific domains with disparate system architectures and data: a sensor and data transport network for air frame tracking and display, and a deep space mission spacecraft command link. Finally, we present empirical evidence illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in these domains, and introduce the entropy of a time series sensor as a critical measure of data similarity for test data in these domains.",,978-1-4244-6047-2,,10.1109/THS.2010.5655105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655105,data generation;experimental method;information assurance;similarity classes,Detectors;Entropy;Generators;Markov processes;Measurement;Radar tracking;Space vehicles,aerospace computing;data handling;security of data,IA devices;air frame tracking;anomaly detector;data synthesis process;data transport network;information assurance technique,,0,,16,,,8-10 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

To evaluate the performance of this approach, we first introduce an analytical model. The results of this model reveal that the detection time of misbehaved nodes is reduced, and the impact of false positives and false negatives is minimised (that is, the overall accuracy is increased).

Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification.

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer.

Sci., Towson Univ., Towson, MD, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110314,2011,8,3,377,390,"Active worms pose major security threats to the Internet. This is due to the ability of active worms to propagate in an automated fashion as they continuously compromise computers on the Internet. Active worms evolve during their propagation, and thus, pose great challenges to defend against them. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, referred to as Camouflaging Worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm is different from traditional worms because of its ability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time. Thereby, the C-Worm camouflages its propagation from existing worm detection systems based on analyzing the propagation traffic generated by worms. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and nonworm traffic (background traffic). We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain. However, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the Power Spectral Density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from background traffic. Using a comprehensive set of detection metrics and real-world traces as background traffic, we conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed spectrum-based detection scheme. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation. Furthermore, we show the generality of our spectrum-based scheme in effectively detecting not only the C-Worm, but traditional worms as well.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.13,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444887,Worm;anomaly detection.;camouflage,Computer networks;Computer worms;Density measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Internet;Large-scale systems;Power measurement;Recruitment;Telecommunication traffic;Volume measurement,Internet;invasive software,C-Worm propagation detection;Internet;active worms;background traffic;camouflaging worm detection;camouflaging worm modeling;nonworm traffic;power spectral density distribution;propagation traffic;security threats;spectral flatness measure;spectrum-based scheme,,7,,65,,4/8/2010,May-June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks.

This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

To achieve these goals, several papers have explored the concept of mutual revocation (sometimes termed suicide) wherein the trust value of both the accuser and the accused node are temporarily set to zero without involving a quorum. In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation.

Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots.

The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features.

Scalable Hypergrid k-NN-Based Online Anomaly Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks,Miao Xie; Jiankun Hu; Song Han; Hsiao-Hwa Chen,"Sch. of Eng. & Inf. Technol., Univ. of New South Wales (UNSW), Canberra, ACT, Australia","Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20130626,2013,24,8,1661,1670,"Online anomaly detection (AD) is an important technique for monitoring wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which protects WSNs from cyberattacks and random faults. As a scalable and parameter-free unsupervised AD technique, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has attracted a lot of attention for its applications in computer networks and WSNs. However, the nature of lazy-learning makes the kNN-based AD schemes difficult to be used in an online manner, especially when communication cost is constrained. In this paper, a new kNN-based AD scheme based on hypergrid intuition is proposed for WSN applications to overcome the lazy-learning problem. Through redefining anomaly from a hypersphere detection region (DR) to a hypercube DR, the computational complexity is reduced significantly. At the same time, an attached coefficient is used to convert a hypergrid structure into a positive coordinate space in order to retain the redundancy for online update and tailor for bit operation.

Cyber attacks could block the connection between SCADA Control Centre and its remote devices or insert fake commands and/or measurements in the equipment communications.

Modeling is in charge of predicting consequences of cyber attacks on SCADA and the electrical grid, while the test bed is in charge to reproduce cyber attacks and their propagation more realistically then modeling.

However, most of them have difficulties such as high dependency to predefined correlation rule definitions and domain knowledge, huge volume of computing workload in some cases and limited capability in discovering new attack scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a new alert correlation method to automatically extract multi-step attack scenarios. This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets.

This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen.

Based on the information extracted from network flows a model of normal user behavior is discovered with the help of several clustering techniques. This model is then used to detect anomalies within recent time intervals. Since this approach is based on normal user behavior, it can potentially detect zero-day intrusions.

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event.

Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds for Malware Campaign Discovery,"Jialong Zhang; Saha, S.; Guofei Gu; Sung-Ju Lee; Mellia, M.",,"Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on",20150723,2015,,,630,641,"HTTP is a popular channel for malware to communicate with malicious servers (e.g., Command & Control, drive-by download, drop-zone), as well as to attack benign servers. By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives.

Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.).

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign.

By using a reasonable clustering algorithm, our scheme can integrate efficiently with the cluster-based intrusion detection scheme and can, hence, improve the whole security of a wireless sensor network.

Basically, Internet was built with the focus on its functionality and not with the focus on the security tasks. This has led to discovering embedded weaknesses in Internet architecture, which can be misused by attackers with malicious purposes. This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server.

We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency.

A Generic Scheme for the Construction of Contextual Signatures with Hash Function in Intrusion Detection,Yuxin Meng; Lam-for Kwok,"Comput. Sci.

But the suffering problem of these systems is that a large amount of non-critical alarms will be generated during the detection process which increase the analysis burden and lower the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems in real deployment. We argue that this bottleneck stems primarily from the lack of information related to the actual settings. To mitigate this limitation, we advocate that the way of combining intrusion detection signatures with contextual information is a promising and effective solution. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the construction of contextual signatures in intrusion detection systems by means of hash function to identify and filter out non-critical alarms.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life.

Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection.

Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities.

Outdoor perimeter security sensors a forty year perspective,"Harman, K.; Messner, W.K.","Harman Analytics, Almonte, ON, Canada","Security Technology (ICCST), 2012 IEEE International Carnahan Conference on",20121231,2012,,,1,9,"Outdoor perimeter security sensors have played, and continue to play, an important role in the security of critical assets and VIP residents over the past 40 years. In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as “Slow-Tech” in a “High-Tech” world. In “High-Tech” we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the “Slow-Tech” world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the “real world” of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This “mil-spec” environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small “spin-off” one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited. More recently most of one product companies have merged into larger “one-stop-shopping” companies.

Analyzing the data collected from smart meters can expose habits and can be potentially used to predict consumers' behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the confidentiality of information in the AMI consisting of nodes with interdependent correlated security assets. On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the expected behavior of a rational attacker?; 2) What is the optimal strategy of the defender?; and 3) Can we configure the security modes on each node to discourage the attacker from launching any attacks? In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI. Using our model, we derive the minimum defense resources required and the optimal strategy of the defender.

This centralized center may be an outsourced company that provides an intrusion detection management service to organizations or a system of the National Computer Emergency Response Team that probes the attacks targeting organizations that have critical information systems. For reasons of ensuring privacy, we adopt the notion of l-Diversity in the course of collecting intrusion logs from organizations. Within our framework, an organization ensures the people in the center cannot discern the exact origin of any intrusion log among the other l-1 organizations. Also, it is not possible to precisely identify the classification type of an intrusion log from among other l-1 types. Within this framework, the intrusion log management center can analyze the anonymous data, since the proposed privacy preserving solution creates little information loss.

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system.

In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge.

Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations.

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection.

In this paper, a novel IP traceback approach based on packet logging and deterministic packet marking (LDPM) is proposed, that significantly improves IP traceback in several aspects: (1) LDPM is built on a distributed hierarchical IP traceback system, and is simple to deploy. (2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers. Compared with previous traceback schemes, LDPM improves the performance and practicability of IP traceback.",,978-0-7695-3825-9,,10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.40,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341555,IP traceback;deterministic packet marking;distributed denial of service;network security;packet logging,Computer crime;Computer networks;Embedded computing;Encoding;IP networks;Information security;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Privacy;Protection,IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security,DoS attack;IP header encoding scheme;IP spoofing attack;IP traceback mechanism;attack ingress router;deterministic packet logging;deterministic packet marking;distributed hierarchical IP traceback system;network topology privacy protection;single packet router,,3,,24,,,25-27 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Therefore, packet analysis systems examine network traffic to detect active botnets and spreading worms. However, with the advent of multi-gigabit link speeds, capturing and analysing header and payload of every packet requires enormous amounts of computational resources and is therefore not feasible in many situations. We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets.

Nonlinear Dynamic Process Monitoring Using Canonical Variate Analysis and Kernel Density Estimations,"Odiowei, P.-E.P.; Yi Cao","Dept. of Process & Syst.

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively.

However, the security mechanism for WSNs has to be considered differently from traditional network. Firstly, there are severe constraints on WSNs devices such as minimal energy, computational and communicational capabilities. Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack.

LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm has already been proven as the most promising outlier detection method for detecting network intrusions. To improve the performance of detection, LOF needs a complete set of normal behaviors of business applications, which is usually not available in cloud computing.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA “10. KIDS” core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties.

Classification of SIP messages by a syntax filter and SVMs,"Ferdous, R.; Lo Cigno, R.; Zorat, A.","Univ. of Trento, Trento, Italy","Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2012 IEEE",20130422,2012,,,2714,2719,"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is at the root of many sessions-based applications such as VoIP and media streaming that are used by a growing number of users and organizations. The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.",1930-529X,978-1-4673-0920-2,978-1-4673-0919-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527,,,pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing,SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter,,0,,15,,,3-7 Dec. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows.

Based on the large samples, we report on a preliminary proof-of-concept approach, that's logistic regression analysis, to evaluate the probability of host that run into insecure status. The evaluation results are regarded as the normalized abnormality value to evaluate the network traffic of hosts. Experiments and testing show that this method can reasonably evaluate the host network abnormal traffic.",,978-1-4244-2909-7,978-1-4244-2910-3,10.1109/EBISS.2009.5138070,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5138070,,Computer science;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Probability;Regression analysis;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,computer networks;probability;regression analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,abnormal network traffic pattern;fixed time window;host security evaluation;logistic regression analysis;probability;proof-of-concept approach,,0,,13,,,23-24 May 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

A multiagent-based IDS (ABIDS) inspired by the danger theory of human immune system is proposed. The intelligence behind ABIDS is based on the functionality of dendritic cells in human immune systems and the danger theory, while dentritic cells agents (DC agent) are emulated for innate immune subsystem and artificial T-cell agents (TC agent) are for adaptive immune subsystem. Antigens are profiles of system calls while corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses.

A Dynamic Anomaly Detection Scheme for AODV-Based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Nakayama, H.; Kurosawa, S.; Jamalipour, A.; Nemoto, Y.; Kato, N.","Grad. Sch. of Inf. Sci., Tohoku Univ., Sendai","Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on",20090508,2009,58,5,2471,2481,"Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are usually formed without any major infrastructure. As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks.

These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm.

The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one.

In the worst case, simultaneous intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations.

However, most of the current security technologies do not provide early warnings about such attacks. This paper presents a Finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that uses an adaptive risk approach to predict multi-staged cloud attacks. The risk model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The attacks prediction model was integrated with our autonomous cloud intrusion detection framework (ACIDF) to raise early warnings about attacks to the controller so it can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments on DARPA 2000 dataset, the proposed prediction model has successfully fired the early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack.

The proposed QSV method is based on quick sampling of the input stream against fixed-length pattern prefixes, and on-demand verification of variable-length pattern suffixes. Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases. Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC. A pattern with distinct 16-byte prefix only occupies up to three lookup table entries in QSV. The overall memory cost of our system is about 1.4 Mbyte, i.e., 1.4 bit per character of the ClamAV pattern set.

We show that a simple approach based on cascading classification leads to the classification cost of 0.2079. Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples. We argue that cascading classification is a viable alternative in scenarios where less complex machine learning approaches are favorable, for example due to possible performance degradation in resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems or sensors.",2166-0662,978-1-4799-3857-5,,10.1109/ISMS.2014.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280878,Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH);KDD99 classifier learning contest;cascading classification;intrusion detection;k-nearest-neighbor classification,Accuracy;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Probes;Training data,learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,cascading classification;clustering approach;machine learning;network intrusion detection,,,,,,,27-29 Jan. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism.

Since MFs are transmitted without encryption or authentication, attackers can easily launch various attacks by forging the MFs. In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics.

In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications.

It is difficult to prevent because DDoS attacker send spoofing packets to victim which makes the identification of the origin of attacks very difficult. A series of techniques have been studied such as pattern matching by learning the attack pattern and abnormal traffic detection. However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks. Moreover, the amount of traffic flowing through the Internet increase rapidly and thus packet analysis should be done within considerable amount of time.

In many applications, it is important to take into account some extra knowledge in addition to the one encoded by the classifier. For example, in spam filtering which can be seen as a classification problem, it can make sense for a user to require that the spam filter predicts less than a given rate or number of spams. In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as ""it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal"" can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise classifiers' outputs in order to fit the expert knowledge.

This approach converts all the profiles composing the training database into 2-dimensional geometric points such that these points lie on the the same line y = n-x.

Outside the Closed World: On Using Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection,"Sommer, R.; Paxson, V.","Int. Comput. Sci. Inst., Lawrence Berkeley Nat.

However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational ""real world"" settings.

EliMet: Security metric elicitation in power grid critical infrastructures by observing system administrators' responsive behavior,"Zonouz, S.; Houmansadr, A.; Haghani, P.","Univ. of Miami, Miami, FL, USA","Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 2012 42nd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on",20120809,2012,,,1,12,"To protect complex power-grid control networks, efficient security assessment techniques are required. However, efficiently making sure that calculated security measures match the expert knowledge is a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we present EliMet, a framework that combines information from different sources and estimates the extent to which a control network meets its security objective. Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Our experimental results show that EliMet can optimally make use of prior knowledge as well as automated inference techniques to minimize human involvement and efficiently deduce the expert knowledge regarding individual states of that particular system.",1530-0889,978-1-4673-1624-8,978-1-4673-1623-1,10.1109/DSN.2012.6263941,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263941,Power grid critical infrastructure;intrusion detection and response;security metric;situational awareness,Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Security,control engineering computing;inference mechanisms;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system protection;power system security,EliMet;automated inference techniques;bulk electricity delivery system;complex power-grid control network protection;power grid critical infrastructures;security assessment techniques;security incidents;security measures;security metric elicitation,,4,,42,,,25-28 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection.

Unveiling flat traffic on the Internet: An SSH attack case study,"Jonker, M.; Hofstede, R.; Sperotto, A.; Pras, A.","Centre for Telematics & Inf. Technol.

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.",,,,10.1109/INM.2015.7140301,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301,,Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes,Internet;computer network security;security of data,IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks,,0,,14,,,11-15 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials.

These trends can make control systems vulnerable to cyber attack, which in the case of control systems may impact physical processes causing environmental harm or injury. We present some results of the DATES (Detection and Analysis of Threats to the Energy Sector) project, wherein we adapted and developed several intrusion detection technologies for control systems. The suite of detection technologies was integrated and connected to a commercial security event correlation framework from ArcSight. We demonstrated the efficacy of our detection and correlation solution on two coupled testbed environments.

Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164,Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security,Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages,Web sites;security of data,BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site,,4,,36,,,Aug-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,
An Intrusion Detection Approach Based on System Call Sequences and Rules Extraction,Ye Qing; Wu Xiaoping; Yan Bo,"Depart. of Inf.

Anomaly detection is an approach of intrusion detection that constructs models of normal behavior of users or systems and detects the behaviors that deviate from the model. Monitoring the sequences of system calls generated during the execution of privileged programs has been known to be an effective means of anomaly detection. In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined. And the detection algorithm is given for the application of rough set theory in intrusion detection. The illustrative example shows that it is feasible and effective.",,978-1-4244-5893-6,978-1-4244-5895-0,10.1109/EBISS.2010.5473675,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473675,,Computer networks;Data mining;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Monitoring;Protection;Set theory;Statistics,rough set theory;security of data,anomaly detection;information security threats;intrusion detection approach;rough set theory;rules extraction;system call sequences,,2,,14,,,22-23 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.",,,,10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240,Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection,Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training,Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data,Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access,,0,,19,,,19-20 Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Biologically inspired risk assessment in cyber security using neural networks,"Ionita, M.-G.; Patriciu, V.-V.","Mil. Tech. Acad., Bucharest, Romania","Communications (COMM), 2014 10th International Conference on",20140726,2014,,,1,4,"The only suitable option for risk assessment systems designed with real-time constraints in mind, in the present seems to be the one based on attack graphs. Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.",,,,10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746,attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment,Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management,computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management,Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data,,2,,10,,,29-31 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers. Thus, we conclude that estimating the information entropy and the relevant inference risk using a pre-processor can yield a simpler and more accurate classification tree.",1082-3409,978-1-4244-5619-2,978-0-7695-3920-1,10.1109/ICTAI.2009.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362617,,Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Facebook;Information entropy;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Risk analysis;Social network services,decision trees;entropy;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;mobile computing;pattern classification;risk analysis,Web2.0 applications;classification tree analysis;data training;decision tree;information entropy;knowledge representation;large mobile phone field;location-aware application;low-entropy situations;preprocessor;social inference risk estimation method;unwanted social inference function;user privacy,,2,,29,,,2-4 Nov. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

However, behavior of applications running in embedded systems is relatively known, and profiling the correct behavior and comparing it with the runtime behavior is accounted as an effective approach for anomaly detection with no such interferences.

Quantifying resiliency and detection latency of intrusion detection structures,"Striki, M.; Manousakis, K.; Kindred, D.; Sterne, D.; Lawler, G.; Ivanic, N.; Tran, G.",,"Military Communications Conference, 2009. MILCOM 2009. IEEE",20100115,2009,,,1,8,"A network intrusion detection (ID) system detects malicious behavior by analyzing network traffic. Malicious behavior may target the disruption of communications, infrastructure services, and applications. A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers. We define this mapping for a) various types of tree structures that have been proposed previously for dynamic wireless systems and b) a hypercube structure that presents promising resiliency characteristics.

This limits the chances that companies move onto the cloud, which could have otherwise become an extremely attractive alternative for the businesses. The need is to make cloud services more reliable and trustworthy for the businesses by providing a proper security mechanism that addresses the existing drawbacks in cloud computing. The key is a firewall model that constitutes a centralized Cloud Firewall Management Server and Firewall Clients that communicate with the Cloud Firewall Management Server.

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers.

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider.

PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic.

First International Conference on",20100112,2009,,,13,20,"Data mining is the use of algorithms to extract the information and patterns derived by the knowledge discovery in databases process. Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models.

The sheer volume of the data prohibits efficient detection from a pure algorithmic approach. However timely detection of such sophisticated scanning attacks is critical since the attacker employing these approaches is usually well-resourced and potentially can bring high impact to the network than a naive attacker can. To detect such sophisticated scans we propose the integration of algorithmic detection and visualization for human detection to simultaneously optimize computational complexity and human analyst time. The proposed approach provides real world detection capabilities without excessive computation overhead. We characterize the features of scanning attacks in a graph theory context, propose efficient graph algorithms to extract these features in real time, employ visualization techniques to show the relevant multidimensional characteristics, and provide test scenarios to show that the proposed work is more efficient and effective than previous approaches.",1550-3607,,,10.1109/ICC.2013.6654827,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654827,,Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Feature extraction;IP networks;Ports (Computers);Probes;Visualization,computer network security;graph theory,graph theory;sophisticated scanning attack;sophisticated stealthy network;visualization technique,,0,,9,,,9-13 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes.

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior.

Accurate mine detection in such application is very important otherwise it may lead to loss of life. Prompted by this we propose an adaptive sensor placement algorithm where sensor placement is dynamically determined based on existing mine concentration in a given area thus ensuring that sensors are localized in the region of higher mine concentration. We further use clustering algorithm for data aggregation from sensor nodes reported from high mine density region; this ensures optimum utilization of sensor batteries which is one of the major determinants in sensor lifetime and hence system reliability.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives.

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.74,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654513,Sensor networks;local monitoring;malicious nodes.;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna,Antennas;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Sleep;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,ELMO;WSN;energy aware local monitoring;energy constrained system;energy consumption;local monitoring based security algorithm;sleep wake management;wireless sensor network,,3,,40,,12/3/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.",,978-1-4799-8098-7,,10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618,Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System,Hafnium;IP networks,Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing,AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback,,0,,18,,,28-30 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended.

A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs.

The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals.

Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams,"Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on",20100524,2010,,,1,8,"In this work we consider the problem of monitoring information streams for anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies.

Accelerating network applications on X86-64 platforms,Gao Xia; Bin Liu,"Dept. of Comput.

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.",,978-1-4673-2433-5,,10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514,,Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors,decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks,base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary,,2,,,,,8-11 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.",,,,10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947,Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis,Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines,Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines,Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine,,0,,21,,,24-26 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks.

As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share.

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.",,,,10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958,,Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training,computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics),CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method,,0,,30,,,13-15 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Our approach introduces the relevant theories of label switching path in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and makes use of routing path to set up a Trace back Path (TP). During the trace back process, we can reconstruct the attack path on the basis of label switching mechanism. We use mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation results show that compared to HIT and SPIE, two state-of-art single-packet trace back approaches, the storage overhead in our approach is only related to the number of routing paths, no matter how many packets traverse on the paths, and the number of queried routers during the trace back process is only related to the number of hops in an attack path.",1066-6192,978-1-4673-0226-5,,10.1109/PDP.2012.40,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169557,,Computer crime;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Switches,IP networks;multiprotocol label switching;telecommunication network routing,HIT;MPLS;SPIE;demand routers;label switching path;multi-protocol label switching;routing path;single-packet IP traceback;trace back path,,1,,14,,,15-17 Feb. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because a more secure configuration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our metric counts how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security because the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will be significantly lower. We formally define the metric, analyze the complexity of computing the metric, devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and finally demonstrate through case studies that applying the metric to existing network security practices may generate actionable knowledge.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2013.24,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529081,Security metrics;attack graph;network hardening;network security,,computer network security,computational complexity;heuristic algorithms;k zero day safety;network security metric;software flaws,,2,,43,,6/11/2013,Jan.-Feb. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

The proliferation of smart devices has led to an emergence of various services such as messengers, SNS and smart banking, and brought convenience in using the services. However, the threat called security vulnerabilities is being faced on the other side. The damages suffered from such a threat are personal information leakage, unreasonable charging, root permission acquisition and so on. In addition, it is said that Android, which is considered as the most vulnerable operating system among the smart devices' operating systems, has the greatest damage of malware codes. Accordingly, this paper proposes a technique to detect malicious codes based on Android devices by using the multivariate time-series analysis. A variety of resource information is integrated into a resource to organize data, and an autoregressive moving average model of the time-series models is used to carry out the modeling.

GATS integrates the concept of tabu list which may increase local search performance. Then, an incremental SVM with reserved set method (R-ISVM) is developed to deal with the problem of intrusion detection. Thirdly, according to the variations of classification hyperplane in incremental training, R-ISVM utilizes a concentric-circle model based reserved set strategy to maintain the samples that are most likely to be support vectors in future computation.

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns.

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own.

To better defend these PoIs, the design of the bistatic radar network is investigated in two stages. First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.",1536-1276,,,10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889,Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game,Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors,,,,0,,21,,1/22/2013,Mar-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts. Besides that, a optimizer called Firefly Algorithm was also used to enhance the results by optimizing both Apriori and SOM parameters and a comparative study was performed on both optimized and non-optimized models. The OHM showed to be superior to a non-optimized model for both eMule and Skype applications, reaching levels superior to 94% for correctness rate. The OHM was also validated against another model based on computational intelligence, named Realtime, and the OHM proposed in this work presented better results when tested in real time.",,,,10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755057,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755057,Association Rules;Firefly Algorithm;Network Traffic Measurement;Self-Organizing Maps,Association rules;Computational modeling;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems;Training,Internet;computer network management;cryptography;data mining;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;self-organising feature maps,Apriori;DPI;Internet;OHM;Realtime computational intelligence;SOM;Skype;association rules;deep packet inspection;eMule;encrypted data;firefly algorithm;hybrid model;network traffic classification;network traffic identification;optimized hybrid model;port-based inspection;rule-based model;self-organizing map;traffic volume,,1,,24,,,7-10 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Multi-Core Architecture on FPGA for Large Dictionary String Matching,"Qingbo Wang; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.",,978-0-7695-3716-0,,10.1109/FCCM.2009.43,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944,FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching,Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput,DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching,Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance,,5,,19,,,5-7 April 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

In DPI the packet payload is compared against a set of predefined patterns which can be specified using regular expressions (regexes). It is well-known that mapping regexes to deterministic finite automata (DFA) will suffer from the state explosion problem. Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided. Further, it achieves a fully automated signature compilation with polynomial running time and space.",1550-3607,978-1-4244-6402-9,,10.1109/ICC.2010.5501976,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501976,,Automata;Communications Society;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;History;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Polynomials,,,,1,1,14,,,23-27 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations.

Preliminary evaluation of imaging sonars for high-security underwater assessment,"Burnett, D.C.; Sheaffer, D.","Sandia Nat.

Tested systems included the BlueView ProViewer P450E-15, BlueView ProViewer P900E-20, and RESON SeaBat 7128, which were chosen for the good balance of resolution and range provided by their frequency of operation (450 kHz, 900 kHz, and 400 kHz, respectively) revealed during a prior study. Video clips were recorded from these systems while observing swimmers, open-circuit scuba divers, and closed-circuit rebreather divers in a marine harbor in St. Petersburg, FL. Clips were randomized and presented to 18 volunteer evaluators who were asked to identify which clips contained divers and which did not. The highest scoring system also had the highest operating frequency. However, the same high-scoring sonar in a different configuration scored similar to the system with the lowest frequency. This indicates that signal frequency, and therefore image resolution, is not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. After noticing many evaluators performed poorly with cluttered clips or clips with low acoustic target strength, results were recalculated to remove swimmers and surface swim routes such that only uncluttered, clearly-reflecting targets were included. Some sonar scores were moderately improved by this change, while others significantly decreased. This indicated that target clarity is also not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. Further analysis is recommended to reveal all major factors affecting assessment to maximize quality and eventually bring underwater security assessment to a high level.",,978-1-4244-4332-1,,10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664320,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664320,,Acoustic beams;Acoustics;Book reviews;Humans;Imaging;Security;Sonar,sonar imaging;underwater acoustic communication,high security underwater assessment;human recognizable images;imaging sonars;preliminary evaluation;surface swim routes,,0,,1,,,20-23 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
Mitigating Packet Dropping Problem in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: Proposals and Challenges,"Djahel, S.; Nait-abdesselam, F.; Zonghua Zhang","Dept. of Comput.

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them.

Exploits are many times used by worms to fast propagate across the full Internet being Web servers one of their main targets. New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.",1060-9857,978-0-7695-3826-6,,10.1109/SRDS.2009.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421,exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware,Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server,Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security,HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit,,1,1,36,,,27-30 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large.

By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists.

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack.

On the inefficacy of Euclidean classifiers for detecting self-similar Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages,"Mehta, A.; Hantehzadeh, N.; Gurbani, V.K.; Tin Kam Ho; Koshiko, J.; Viswanathan, R.","Southern Illinois Univ., Carbondale, IL, USA","Integrated Network Management (IM), 2011 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on",20110818,2011,,,329,336,"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an important multimedia session establishment protocol used on the Internet. Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, most deployments over UDP, limited use of message encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level. To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages.

In this paper, we propose a new framework for real-time alert correlation which consists of two phases: Alert Preprocessing Phase and Scenario Constructing Phase. In our structure, we aggregate alerts into graph structures and then we extract unknown attack scenarios with mining frequent structure patterns. This method is based on the observation that most alerts have frequent and sequential characteristic, since we can use frequent item set mining methods for extracting attack scenarios.

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN). In CMN we first cluster the benign training data and then from each cluster we build a separate markov network to model the benign behavior. During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data.

Third International Conference on",20091110,2009,,,107,114,"Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.",,978-1-4244-5087-9,978-0-7695-3838-9,10.1109/NSS.2009.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955,P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation,Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing,P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm,,0,,14,,,19-21 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules. One uses a bloom filter to filter the duplicate packets and store the source addresses. The other uses two-dimensional bit arrays to process packets. The offline estimates the cardinality.

Automated Discovery of Credit Card Data Flow for PCI DSS Compliance,"Hizver, J.; Tzi-cker Chiueh","Dept. of Comput.

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code.

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS.

A Reputation-Based Clustering Mechanism for MANET Routing Security,"Ben Chehida, A.; Abassi, R.; El Fatmi, S.G.","Higher Sch. of Commun., Univ. of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia","Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES), 2013 Eighth International Conference on",20131107,2013,,,310,315,"A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes having no fixed topology and cooperating with each other. Due to these particularities, classical routing protocols cannot be used and some specific ones have been proposed. Because routing process is fundamental in a MANET deployment, it constitutes a privileged target of attackers. In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.",,,,10.1109/ARES.2013.42,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258,Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security,Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology,mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security,MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols,,1,,9,,,2-6 Sept. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability.

These targeted attacks use special-crafted malware and infrequent activity to avoid detection, so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time. In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported.

Here all the resources are at one place in data centers. Cloud uses public and private APIs (Application Programming Interface) to provide services to its consumers in multitenant environment. In this environment Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS), especially HTTP, XML or REST based DDoS attacks may be very dangerous and may provide very harmful effects for availability of services and all consumers will get affected at the same time. One other reason is that because the cloud computing users make their request in XML then send this request using HTTP protocol and build their system interface with REST protocol such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure. So the threaten coming from distributed REST attacks are more and easy to implement by the attacker, but to security expert very difficult to resolve.

In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically. In addition, violations of security requirements at runtime are monitored. We show how decisions related to those security requirements can be identified through the documentation and updated manually. Overall, our approach improves the quality and completeness of security decision documentation to support the engineering and evolution of security requirements.",,,,10.1109/ESPRE.2014.6890520,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890520,Security requirements engineering;decision documentation;decision knowledge;heuristic analysis;knowledge carrying software;software evolution;user mon-itoring,Context;Documentation;IEEE Potentials;Knowledge engineering;Monitoring;Security;Software,formal specification;security of data;system documentation,end user monitoring;heuristic analysis;heuristic assessment method;organization;security decision documentation;security decisions;security issues;security knowledge;semiautomatic security requirements engineering;software engineers;software evolution;vulnerability,,0,,18,,,25-25 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, widespread usage over UDP, limited use of encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level to launch denial of service attacks. To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances. We present our analysis on a new dataset that has minimal difference between normal and anomalous messages.

Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks.

Fifth International Conference on",20091006,2009,,,401,409,"Automated animal monitoring with energy efficient wireless devices mounted on the animals can improve efficiency of farming industry and increase its profitability by decreasing reliance on human labor. We discuss the practical deployment of delay tolerant store and forward cattle monitoring architecture that provides data retention, detecting custom events, notification issuing, remote and in-situ queries answering. The core of this architecture, a novel energy efficient, disruption tolerant, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocol (EERD), provides offloading data for long term storage by sending data to farm servers via sinks that are a part of a MANET and handles in-situ queries issued by users collocated with the animals. The energy efficiency is achieved by dynamic adaptation to the current behavior of the animals carrying the monitoring devices.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units.

RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications.

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters.

Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature.

In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it. The proposed event collector framework can collect all posted information and store it in a relational database for further analysis. Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour.

Firewalls provide a false sense of security because they have inherent flaws that are continuously exploited by hackers. Current firewalls lack in providing adequate security against insiders. Literature suggests that these limitations arise from the deficiencies in firewall design. This paper presents a model of a firewall called disarming firewall. The model is composed of different components, each serving different purpose. The firewall protects against malicious insiders by limiting the attacking capabilities of each internal host. Knowing that obtaining knowledge of end systems is a precursor of an attack, the firewall hides the identity of OS and server software placed in DMZ from internal as well as external users. Another problem solved by the firewall is the general laziness in applying patches to the software. The auditing system of firewall actively monitors all systems in the perimeter and applies patches as soon as they are released.",,978-1-4244-8001-2,,10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625739,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625739,Disarmed Host;Firewall;Network Security,Authentication;Fires;Internet;Monitoring;Servers;Software,authorisation;computer crime;operating systems (computers),auditing system;disarming firewall;hackers;network security;operating system;server software,,0,,22,,,14-16 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve overtime. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime. We propose a new methodology to associate the novelty patterns detected by the algorithm, in an unsupervised fashion, with the true classes.

Security Incident Origin Discovery (SIOD): IP Transaction Tracking for Centralized Cyber Defense,"Charbonneau, N.; Newman, B.; Pecelli, D.","MITRE Corp., Bedford, MA, USA","Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,30,39,"In many enterprise Internet Protocol networks, Network Address Translation and other traffic forwarding techniques protect interior assets from exterior threats by minimizing exposure to just a single, hardened point. Complex networks may incorporate several layers of such protection. However, this obfuscation also hinders legitimate cyber security functions, discovering the complete path of a suspicious traffic flow requires inspecting forwarders' logs, unraveling one layer of concealment at a time. These challenges are compounded when centralized cyber-defense teams must pursue suspicious activity across numerous regional and individual site networks. Identifying a single host at the end of a dubious transaction may require coordination among central, regional, and local administrators, as well as human review of many intermediary devices' activity logs. In this paper, we describe an approach to automate the investigation process by correlating details of alerts and forwarder records to iteratively discover the chain of forwarders implicated in a given transaction. By rapidly revealing a suspicious transaction's true endpoints, incident response times can be dramatically reduced, allowing for rapid intervention and analysis. We present our prototype tracing algorithm in pseudo-code, describe the diverse lab environment in which it was developed, and detail specific trace scenarios for both web and Domain Name Service traffic. We address unique log formats and behaviors of different forwarders and recommend practices for specific units.

As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses.

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different.

This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples.

Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)).

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions.

Misuse detection is the most popular approach to detect intrusions, using a library of signatures to find attacks. The accuracy of the signatures is paramount for an effective IDS, still today's practitioners rely on manual techniques to improve and update those signatures. We present a system, called pSigene, for the automatic generation of intrusion signatures by mining the vast amount of public data available on attacks. It follows a four-step process to generate the signatures, by first crawling attack samples from multiple public cyber security web portals. Then, a feature set is created from existing detection signatures to model the samples, which are then grouped using a biclustering algorithm which also gives the distinctive features of each cluster. Finally the system automatically creates a set of signatures using regular expressions, one for each cluster. We tested our architecture for SQL injection attacks and found our signatures to have a True and False Positive Rates of 90.52% and 0.03%, respectively and compared our findings to other SQL injection signature sets from popular IDS and web application firewalls.

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution.

Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers.

This paper studies distributed combined authentication and intrusion detection with data fusion in such MANETs. Multimodal biometrics are deployed to work with intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to alleviate the shortcomings of unimodal biometric systems. Since each device in the network has measurement and estimation limitations, more than one device needs to be chosen, and observations can be fused to increase observation accuracy using Dempster-Shafer theory for data fusion. The system decides whether user authentication (or IDS input) is required and which biosensors (or IDSs) should be chosen, depending on the security posture. The decisions are made in a fully distributed manner by each authentication device and IDS. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",0018-9545,,,10.1109/TVT.2010.2103098,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678662,Authentication;biometrics;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);security,,authorisation;biometrics (access control);distributed processing;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;sensor fusion;telecommunication security,Dempster-Shafer theory;IDS;MANET;biosensor;data fusion;distributed combined authentication;high-security mobile ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;multimodal biometric technology;user-to-device authentication,,8,,27,,12/30/2010,Mar-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,
Obfuscation: The Hidden Malware,"O'Kane, P.; Sezer, S.; McLaughlin, K.","Centre for Secure Inf. Technol., Queen's Univ. Belfast, Belfast, UK","Security & Privacy, IEEE",20110926,2011,9,5,41,47,"A cyberwar exists between malware writers and antimalware researchers. At this war's heart rages a weapons race that originated in the 80s with the first computer virus. Obfuscation is one of the latest strategies to camouflage the telltale signs of malware, undermine antimalware software, and thwart malware analysis. Malware writers use packers, polymorphic techniques, and metamorphic techniques to evade intrusion detection systems. The need exists for new antimalware approaches that focus on what malware is doing rather than how it's doing it.",1540-7993,,,10.1109/MSP.2011.98,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975134,computer security;malware;metamorphism;obfuscation;packer;polymorphism,Computer security;Databases;Handwriting recognition;Malware;System-on-a-chip,computer viruses,Cyberwar;Obfuscation malware;antimalware software;computer virus;intrusion detection system;malware writer;metamorphic technique;polymorphic technique;thwart malware analysis,,8,,16,,8/4/2011,Sept.-Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,,
