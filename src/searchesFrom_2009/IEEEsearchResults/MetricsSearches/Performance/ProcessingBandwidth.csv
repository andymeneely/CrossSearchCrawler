A Bray-Curtis Weighted Automaton for Detecting Malicious Code Through System-Call Analysis,"Pungila, C.","Comput. Sci. Dept., West Univ. of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania","Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC), 2009 11th International Symposium on",20100506,2009,,,392,400,"Malicious code detection is one of the top subjects of interest for intrusion detection systems in today's computer security research areas. In this paper we propose a new heuristic method for detecting malicious code through system call matching, which also takes in consideration the time of the system call, by using an adaptive search for an extended Aho-Corasick automaton supporting a subset of the regular expressions language, through the use of a normalization technique known as the Bray-Curtis (Sorensen) distance. We will also discuss how this technique can be applied to enrich the set of existing rules from the knowledge base for improving the detection rate.",,978-1-4244-5910-0,978-1-4244-5911-7,10.1109/SYNASC.2009.41,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460823,Aho-Corasick automata;Bray-Curtis distance;Sorensen distance;dynamic analysis;intrusion detection system;malicious code detection;normalization;static analysis;system call timing,Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Scientific computing;Viruses (medical),automata theory;formal languages;security of data,Aho-Corasick automaton;Bray-Curtis distance;Bray-Curtis weighted automaton;Sorensen distance;computer security;detection rate;intrusion detection;knowledge base;malicious code detection;normalization technique;regular expression language;system call matching;system call time;system-call analysis,,1,,23,,,26-29 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A Survey on the Application of FPGAs for Network Infrastructure Security,"Hao Chen; Yu Chen; Summerville, D.H.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., State Univ. of New York (SUNY) - Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA","Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE",20111103,2011,13,4,541,561,"Given the rapid evolution of attack methods and toolkits, software-based solutions to secure the network infrastructure have become overburdened. The performance gap between the execution speed of security software and the amount of data to be processed is ever widening. A common solution to close this performance gap is through hardware implementation of security functions. Possessing the flexibility of software and high parallelism of hardware, reconfigurable hardware devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), have become increasingly popular for this purpose. FPGAs support the performance demands of security operations as well as enable architectural and algorithm innovations in the future. This paper presents a survey of the state-of-art in FPGA-based implementations that have been used in the network infrastructure security area, categorizing currently existing diverse implementations. Combining brief descriptions with intensive case-studies, we hope this survey will inspire more active research in this area.",1553-877X,,,10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00075,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556740,FPGA;Hardware-based Application;Network Infrastructure Security;Network Security,Computer crime;Field programmable gate arrays;Internet;Network security;Protocols,Internet;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays,FPGA;Internet;field programmable gate arrays;network infrastructure security;reconfigurable hardware devices;security software;software-based solutions,,10,,118,,8/23/2010,Fourth Quarter 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
Optimization of Massive Pattern Queries by Dynamic Configuration Morphing,"Laptev, N.; Zaniolo, C.","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Data Engineering (ICDE), 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on",20120702,2012,,,917,928,"Complex pattern queries play a critical role in many applications that must efficiently search databases and data streams. Current techniques support the search for multiple patterns using deterministic or non-deterministic automata. In practice however, the static pattern representation does not fully utilize available system resources, subsequently suffering from poor performance. Therefore a low overhead auto-reconfigurable automaton is needed that optimizes pattern matching performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration. This is accomplished only with a modest increase in amortized memory usage.",1063-6382,978-1-4673-0042-1,,10.1109/ICDE.2012.52,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228144,,Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Dynamic scheduling;Engines;Equations;Optimization;Pattern matching,data structures;deterministic automata;pattern matching;query processing,autoreconfigurable automaton;data stream;database searching;deterministic automata;dynamic automaton reconfiguration;dynamic configuration morphing;massive pattern query optimization;nondeterministic automata;pattern matching;query pattern representation;resource constrained system;static pattern representation,,1,,29,,,1-5 April 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle and so the technology advancement which proved to be a miracle of the miracles. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one such miracle of the wireless technology which opens up the new dimensions for the researchers to write the technology of the future i.e. ubiquitous computing and intelligence. Nevertheless nature has played its ultimate role as well to give an idea of perfection in optimizing the teething issues in any field and so in WSN. Design and deployment, localization, routing and clustering, QoS management, security etc are few scenarios in WSN. The computational intelligence paradigm (CI) inspired by nature, comprising artificial neural network (ANN), artificial immune system (AIS), evolutionary algorithm (EA), swarm intelligence (SI) and fuzzy logic (FL). These are different flavors for increasing efficiency in terms of memory and computational power which alternatively affects other issues towards perfection i.e. convenience and intelligence. Hybrid and non hybrid algorithms optimizes the issues through CI paradigms, which are presented in this research article relevant to Wireless Sensor Network.
