Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents.

Network anomaly detection tools based on association rules,"Othman, Z.A.; Eljadi, E.E.","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules.

An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis,"Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual",20100115,2009,,,494,503,"Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.",1063-9527,978-0-7695-3919-5,,10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706,intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty,Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty,inference mechanisms;security of data,Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty,,3,,22,,,7-11 Dec. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

To support segmentation of network traffic and to detect fragmented attacks, we propose a method which performs both 'partial' and 'full' pattern matching using the data structure CDAWG (Compact Direct Acyclic Word Graph).

However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized.

Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique.

This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased.

This paper thus brings out some of the in-efficiencies in the existing network monitoring systems and justifies an alternate method for doing the same. It presents a suggestive fresh view on the factors that could prove instrumental in improving monitoring of enterprise data networks by re-using some of the forwarding capabilities in the network nodes. The material also attempts to provide an extended outlook on the immense possibilities offered by the new method.",,978-1-4244-5272-9,,10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374596,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374596,,Engines;Filters;Intrusion detection;Mirrors;Network servers;Pattern analysis;Probes;Remote monitoring;Switches;Telecommunication traffic,business communication;computer network security;packet switching,enterprise data networks;hardware component regeneration TAP;network monitoring systems;node capabilities;packet duplication,,0,,6,,,18-20 Jan. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Using Search Methods for Selecting and Combining Software Sensors to Improve Fault Detection in Autonomic Systems,"Shevertalov, M.; Lynch, K.; Stehle, E.; Rorres, C.; Mancoridis, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Drexel Univ., Philadelphia, PA, USA","Search Based Software Engineering (SSBSE), 2010 Second International Symposium on",20101111,2010,,,120,129,"Fault-detection approaches in autonomic systems typically rely on runtime software sensors to compute metrics for CPU utilization, memory usage, network throughput, and so on. One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

FN-DFE: Fuzzy-Neural Data Fusion Engine for Enhanced Resilient State-Awareness of Hybrid Energy Systems,"Wijayasekara, D.; Linda, O.; Manic, M.; Rieger, C.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Univ. of Idaho, Idaho Falls, ID, USA","Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on",20141013,2014,44,11,2065,2075,"Resiliency and improved state-awareness of modern critical infrastructures, such as energy production and industrial systems, is becoming increasingly important. As control systems become increasingly complex, the number of inputs and outputs increase. Therefore, in order to maintain sufficient levels of state-awareness, a robust system state monitoring must be implemented that correctly identifies system behavior even when one or more sensors are faulty. Furthermore, as intelligent cyber adversaries become more capable, incorrect values may be fed to the operators. To address these needs, this paper proposes a fuzzyneural data fusion engine (FN-DFE) for resilient state-awareness of control systems. The designed FN-DFE is composed of a three-layered system consisting of: 1) traditional threshold based alarms; 2) anomalous behavior detector using self-organizing fuzzy logic system; and 3) artificial neural network-based system modeling and prediction. The improved control system stateawareness is achieved via fusing input data from multiple sources and combining them into robust anomaly indicators. In addition, the neural network-based signal predictions are used to augment the resiliency of the system and provide coherent state-awareness despite temporary unavailability of sensory data. The proposed system was integrated and tested with a model of the Idaho National Laboratory's hybrid energy system facility known as HYTEST. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed FNDFE provides timely plant performance monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities. It was shown that the system is capable of identifying intrusive behavior significantly earlier than conventional threshold-based alarm systems.",2168-2267,,,10.1109/TCYB.2014.2323891,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823672,Artificial neural networks;data fusion;fuzzy logic systems;resilient control systems;state-awareness,Artificial neural networks;Control systems;Monitoring;Robustness;Sensor systems;Vectors,control engineering computing;fuzzy neural nets;power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;sensor fusion,FN-DFE engine;HYTEST facility;Idaho National Laboratory;anomalous behavior detector;artificial neural network-based system;control system state-awareness;control systems;critical infrastructure;energy production system;enhanced resilient state-awareness;fuzzy-neural data fusion engine;hybrid energy systems;industrial system;intelligent cyber adversaries;neural network-based signal predictions;self-organizing fuzzy logic system;system modeling;system prediction;system state monitoring;threshold based alarms;threshold-based alarm systems,,3,,41,,5/30/2014,Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Increases in electricity demand with inadequate delivery infrastructure and cyber-physical attack threats due to technological interdependencies introduce more complex events. Accurate and timely power system event identification and detection have great significance in system operation, monitoring, and control processes. Insufficient and slow event information may lead to catastrophes. Significant research effort is being made toward developing robust monitoring systems using advanced state of the art technologies such as synchrophasor technologies. This paper extends our previous work [1] and proposes a model that leverages the causal relationship between devices in cyber physical systems. Causal event graphs (CEG), a modified version of Bayesian networks, are used to create unique paths that model deterministic signatures of each cyber-physical event. The CEG and Bayesian network can be incorporated to event detection systems (EDS) to classify cyber physical events. A causal event graph for each scenario can be created using a sequence of power system events, measureable states, and logs from different sources. A modified IEEE 9 bus system with multi zone distance protection schemes for two transmission lines is used to demonstrate the proposed concept.

With such a feature, the proposal system can identify whether each communication flow can be trusted or not by checking the querier's IP address and the DNS query target domain name. Then based on the result of checking, the firewall system adaptively decides specific operation for specific connection.

Indeed, the security of guest virtual machines and of the applications and services they host can be improved by leveraging the additional architectural layer introduced by such a technology. This paper discusses security management for virtualized environments and provides several contributions. First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls.

This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it.

However, in comparison to wired network or infrastructure-based wireless network, MANET is particularly vulnerable to security attacks due to its fundamental characteristics, e.g., the open medium, dynamic network topology, autonomous terminal, lack of centralized monitoring and management. The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network. The simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed method as throughput of the network does not deteriorate in presence of the back holes.",,978-1-4673-2172-3,,10.1109/TrustCom.2012.78,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296067,AODV;Ad-hoc network;Black Hole Attack;Malicious node;Secured Routing,Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security,mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security,AODV routing protocol;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;autonomous terminal;black hole problem prevention;centralized management;centralized monitoring;dynamic network topology;infrastructure-based wireless network;malicious node detection;mobile ad-hoc network;mobile devices;open medium;promiscuous mode;security attacks;wired network,,6,,21,,,25-27 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.",,978-1-4673-2708-4,,10.1109/THS.2012.6459829,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829,Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing,Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors,safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing,CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing,,1,,18,,,13-15 Nov. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

As a result of this paradigm shift, many key concerns such as the transparency of data transfer and access within the cloud, and the lack of clarity in data ownership were surfaced. To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud.

Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors. We conduct our experiments in the campus-wide data center, and the results show our detection system can promptly and accurately response to DoS attacks.",,978-1-4799-8086-4,,10.1109/CBD.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176094,Attack Detection;Cloud Data Center;DoS Attack;Information Entropy,,cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;data flow analysis;entropy;system monitoring;virtual machines,CPU usage;DoS attack;attack behavior;attack identification;campus-wide data center;cloud data center;cloud resources;cloud service quality degradation;data center subnets;data flow based detection;data flow pattern;entropy-based denial of service attack detection;information entropy;malicious VM;malicious tenants;malicious virtual machines;network resource isolation;network usage;virtual machine status monitoring,,0,,21,,,20-22 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
VMDriver: A Driver-Based Monitoring Mechanism for Virtualization,Guofu Xiang; Hai Jin; Deqing Zou; Xinwen Zhang; Sha Wen; Feng Zhao,"Cluster & Grid Comput. Lab., Huazhong Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Wuhan, China","Reliable Distributed Systems, 2010 29th IEEE Symposium on",20101109,2010,,,72,81,"Monitoring virtual machine (VM) is an essential function for virtualized platforms. Existing solutions are either coarse-grained - monitoring in granularity of VM level, or not general - only support specific monitoring functions for particular guest operating system (OS). Thus they do not satisfy the monitoring requirement in large-scale server cluster such as data center and public cloud platform, where each physical platform runs hundreds of VMs with different guest OSes. In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes. We implement VMDriver on Xen and our experimental study shows that it introduces very small performance overhead. We demonstrate its generality by inspecting four aspects information about the target virtual machines with different guest OSes. The unified interface of VMDriver brings convenience to develop complex monitoring tools for distributed virtualization environment.",1060-9857,978-0-7695-4250-8,,10.1109/SRDS.2010.38,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623381,Driver-based Monitroing;Event Interception;Generality;Semantic Reconstruction;VM Monitoring;Virtualization,Driver circuits;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Semantics,distributed processing;operating systems (computers);system monitoring;virtual machines,VMDriver;data center;distributed virtualization environment;driver-based monitoring mechanism;event interception point;guest OS semantic reconstruction;guest operating system;large-scale server cluster;performance overhead;public cloud platform;variant monitoring driver;virtual machine;virtualization monitoring;virtualized platform,,3,1,24,,,Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Controlling malware HTTP communications in dynamic analysis system using search engine,"Aoki, K.; Yagi, T.; Iwamura, M.; Itoh, M.","NTT Inf. Sharing Platform Labs., NTT Corp., Musashino, Japan","Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS), 2011 Third International Workshop on",20111024,2011,,,1,6,"Malware is one of the most serious threats on the Internet. Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.",,978-1-4577-1034-6,,10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563,dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine,Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines,Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols,HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine,,3,,20,,,8-8 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
A hybrid artificial immune system for IDS based on SVM and belief function,"Singh, S.; Singh, J.P.; Shrivastva, G.","Dept. of Comput.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security system that monitors computer systems and network traffic, analyze that traffic to identify possible security breaches and raise alerts. An IDS triggers thousands of alerts per day which is difficult for human users to analyze them and take appropriate actions. It is important to reduce the false alarm alerts, intelligently integrate and correlate them in order to present a high level view of the detected security issue to the administrator. In this paper an hybrid model has been proposed in which intrusion detection takes place with the help Dendritic Cell Algorithm and Dempester belief theory along with SVM classification algorithms. It made the Intrusion Detection System much more efficient and accurate as compared to the existing System. It also seems to be an improvement in precise value of proper alarm generation to enhance the performance of the system.",,978-1-4799-3925-1,,10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726835,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726835,DCA;Dempster-belif theory;IDS;SVM,Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Filtering;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines,Internet;artificial immune systems;authorisation;belief networks;inference mechanisms;pattern classification;support vector machines,Dempster belief theory;IDS;Internet;SVM classification algorithms;alarm generation;belief function;communication network;computer system monitoring;dendritic cell algorithm;hybrid artificial immune system;information system;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;network traffic monitoring;security breaches;security system;unauthorized access,,0,,13,,,4-6 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Security Enhancement in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Machine Learning,"Raj, A.B.; Ramesh, M.V.; Kulkarni, R.V.; Hemalatha, T.","Amrita Center for Wireless Networks & Applic., Vidyapeetham, India","High Performance Computing and Communication & 2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems (HPCC-ICESS), 2012 IEEE 14th International Conference on",20121018,2012,,,1264,1269,"Ensuring the security of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is vital for monitoring real-time systems. One of the major security flaws experienced by WSNs is denial of service (DoS) which can even lead to the breakdown of the complete system or to wrong decisions being made by the system that can cause adverse results. This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.",,978-1-4673-2164-8,,10.1109/HPCC.2012.186,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332322,Denial of Service;Neural Network;Security;Support Vector Machine;Wireless Sensor Networks,Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;real-time systems;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,DoS attack probability detection;MAC;SVM;WSN;denial of service;machine learning;medium access control;neural network;real-time system monitoring;security enhancement;security flaw;support vector machine;wireless sensor network,,1,,14,,,25-27 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
