	Tests both functions main.validateCSVLine and main.parseCSVLine.

	Occasionally, when there are multiple commas within an entry or 
	there were originally quotation marks within an entry, the way 
	that the IEEE export citations module works inserts quotation marks 
	into entries in a way that messes with a normal CSV parser.

	To solve this problem, main.validateCSVLine was implemented to 
	remove any inner quoation marks in entries. By removing these
	quotation marks, a normal CSV parser is able to effectively parse 
	the lines of CSV data.

	This test ensures that this functionality is in correct working order.

The first section states the main advantages of the cloud computing environment together with its biggest challenges that can introduce significant risks within a company. In order to assess properly the cloud computing adoption, we developed a web based tool that assists the internal auditor in the pre-migration process. Section II describes in details the Migration Assessment Tool (MAT). Starting with its architecture, we presented the main objects manipulated by our application in order to implement a cloud adoption assessment. In order to compute the impact, we classified the questions in different domains and we defined the dependencies between the questions. At the end of section II, we presented the process implemented in MAT when assessing a cloud migration. The paper ends with conclusions that state the main benefits of our approach and future improvements for MAT.","","","","10.1109/SACI.2014.6840073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840073","","Best practices;Cloud computing;Companies;Computational modeling;Computer architecture","auditing;business data processing;cloud computing","MAT;Web based tool;cloud adoption assessment;cloud computing migration auditing;company;internal auditor;migration assessment tool;premigration process","","0","","8","","","15-17 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"'

Previous work by the authors proposed so-called logical consensus approach, by which a network of agents, that can exchange binary values representing their local estimates of the events, is able to reach a unique and consistent decision. The approach therein proposed is based on the construction of an iterative map, whose computation is centralized and guaranteed under suitable conditions on the input visibility and graph connectivity. Under the same conditions, we extend the approach in this work by allowing the construction of a logical linear consensus system that is globally stable in a fully distributed way. The effectiveness of the proposed method is showed through the real implementation of a wireless sensor network as a framework for the surveillance of an urban area.","2153-0858","978-1-4244-6674-0","","10.1109/IROS.2010.5650096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5650096","","","decision making;graph theory;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;routing protocols;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","decision making problem;dynamic agents network;iterative map;logical consensus approach;logical linear consensus system;self-routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","0","","20","","","18-22 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"'

SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) are one of the most significant of such threats. Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.",,978-1-4244-4678-0,978-0-7695-3760-3,10.1109/LADC.2009.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325,Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks,Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes,security of data,Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach,,3,,24,,,1-4 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications'
