The first section states the main advantages of the cloud computing environment together with its biggest challenges that can introduce significant risks within a company. In order to assess properly the cloud computing adoption, we developed a web based tool that assists the internal auditor in the pre-migration process. Section II describes in details the Migration Assessment Tool (MAT). Starting with its architecture, we presented the main objects manipulated by our application in order to implement a cloud adoption assessment. In order to compute the impact, we classified the questions in different domains and we defined the dependencies between the questions. At the end of section II, we presented the process implemented in MAT when assessing a cloud migration. The paper ends with conclusions that state the main benefits of our approach and future improvements for MAT.","","","","10.1109/SACI.2014.6840073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840073","","Best practices;Cloud computing;Companies;Computational modeling;Computer architecture","auditing;business data processing;cloud computing","MAT;Web based tool;cloud adoption assessment;cloud computing migration auditing;company;internal auditor;migration assessment tool;premigration process","","0","","8","","","15-17 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A self-routing protocol for distributed consensus on logical information","Fagiolini, A.; Martini, S.; Di Baccio, D.; Bicchi, A.","Interdept. Res.

Previous work by the authors proposed so-called logical consensus approach, by which a network of agents, that can exchange binary values representing their local estimates of the events, is able to reach a unique and consistent decision. The approach therein proposed is based on the construction of an iterative map, whose computation is centralized and guaranteed under suitable conditions on the input visibility and graph connectivity. Under the same conditions, we extend the approach in this work by allowing the construction of a logical linear consensus system that is globally stable in a fully distributed way. The effectiveness of the proposed method is showed through the real implementation of a wireless sensor network as a framework for the surveillance of an urban area.","2153-0858","978-1-4244-6674-0","","10.1109/IROS.2010.5650096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5650096","","","decision making;graph theory;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;routing protocols;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","decision making problem;dynamic agents network;iterative map;logical consensus approach;logical linear consensus system;self-routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","0","","20","","","18-22 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
