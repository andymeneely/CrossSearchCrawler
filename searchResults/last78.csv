We first present a trade-off model for performance and security on NCS using a networked DC Motor system as an example. Then, a framework of performance-security trade-off optimization based on Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (CGA) for this networked DC motor system is proposed.

Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is the basic data structure to scan input traffic byte by byte. Though DFA meets the requirement of real-time processing of network traffic, constructing a combined DFA for a set of regular expression signatures is very time-consuming, especially when the signature set is large. To attack this problem, we propose new strategies to accelerate DFA construction. The basic idea of our method is to construct the combined DFA by hierarchical merging of the DFAs of each single regular expression.

We discover that the traffic at one time is similar to that at the same time in different days under no attacks but its abrupt changes will occur under attacking. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a model for detecting DDOS attacks automatically. In order to reduce the error to identify attacks, we use discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique.

In the last years these threats have reached a new quality of automatization and sophistication, rendering most defenses ineffective. Conventional security measures that rely on the manual analysis of security incidents and attack development inherently fail to provide a timely protection from these threats. As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses. In this paper, we reconsider the problems, challenges and advantages of combining machine learning and computer security. We identify factors that are critical for the efficacy and acceptance of learning methods in security.

In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886","Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions).

The key of this approach is to model the components of the system as autonomous agents and to simulate their behavior for evaluating the system as a whole. That is very useful for observing the emergence of properties in social, biological, environmental or financial systems, among others. Artificial immune systems, which is a sub field of artificial intelligence, comprises systems modeled by simplifying models from the biological immune system. If agent-based modeling and simulation is used as a laboratory for understanding the biological immune system then, it can also be used for transferring the observed principles into artificial immune system models or for evaluating models that have been already adapted for solving technical problems. This paper presents first, a methodology for transferring principles of the biological immune system into the field of artificial immune systems.

Our design is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. By exploiting this heterogeneity, expensive operations can be delegated to mesh routers, which help alleviate the overhead of mesh clients during key establishment. The new scheme possesses two desirable features: (1) Neighbor mesh clients can directly establish pairwise keys; and (2) Communication and storage costs at mesh clients are significantly reduced.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654744","Deployment knowledge;Matrix;Pairwise key;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Knowledge engineering;Security;Symmetric matrices;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","matrix algebra;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","WMN;adversarial activities;communication costs;deployment knowledge;eavesdropping;matrix-based pairwise key establishment scheme;mesh routers;neighbor mesh clients;security issue;storage costs;wireless mesh networks;wireless transmission","","1","","16","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference. Compared with LLF, our algorithm costs about 5% memory to get the same performance.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425276","","Computer architecture;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Parallel processing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Web server","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;file servers;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","CMP architecture;FPGA technology;LLF algorithm;NIDS;communication overhead;flow-based load balancing;flow-based parallel processing;load balancing;multi-core system;network intrusion detection system;scheduling algorithm;web servers","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Smart home is one of the emerging examples for pervasive computing applications. In a smart home scenario, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can potentially provide information about device activities and their status. This information can be useful for variety of purposes like monitoring home security, examining status of nodes, and replacing nodes that are malfunctioning or dead. The sensor network needs to be protected from intrusions and anomalies. Over the years, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed for preventing WSNs from intrusions. Although some mobile agent based IDS are proposed, anomaly detection for wireless smart home sensor network (WSHSN) is not fully exploited. In this article, we have proposed a mobile agent based anomaly detection mechanism for WSHSNs. The proposed scheme takes advantage from heterogeneous nature of devices in smart home for effectively detecting anomalies. The anomaly detection infrastructure is installed at resource rich nodes such as Cluster Heads (CHs).The mobile agent takes only few bytes of data to further assess the anomalous behavior of suspicious node. The analysis and comparative study show several advantages of the proposed scheme, such as efficient utilization of memory, reducing network load, and reduction in overall computational cost of the network. The nature of our proposed solution is generic, so that as it is, or with slight modifications, it can be implemented on other heterogeneous wireless sensor networks.","","978-1-4673-3084-8","","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332015","anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;mobile Agent;pervasive computing;wireless smart home sensor network","","home computing;mobile agents;security of data;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","CH;IDS;WSHSN;WSN;cluster heads;device activities;home security;intrusion detection systems;memory utilization;mobile agent based anomaly detection;network load reduction;node replacement;node status examination;overall computational cost reduction;pervasive computing applications;suspicious node anomalous behavior;wireless smart home sensor networks","","3","","23","","","4-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Malicious nodes can attack the network by jamming, selectively forwarding packets, black-hole attack and spoofing. In the case of statically deployed, dense Wireless Sensor Networks which use flat routing, alternate path for secure transmission on packets across such malicious nodes have to be found. Scattering multiple copies of the packets in order to reach the sink, leads to more network and energy inefficiency. Moreover, collusion of malicious nodes is addressed vaguely by literature. In this paper, we propose a secure routing methodology which semi-randomly propagates a packet in the shortest path to the Sink by circumventing the malicious nodes. Extensive simulations show that the number of broadcast hops, activity of network and the packet drop ratio are significantly lesser for the proposed routing technique. Simulations also prove that the proposed technique handles collusion of malicious nodes more efficiently.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972317","collusion;malicious node;secure routing;wireless sensor networks","Conferences;Dispersion;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","black-hole attack;broadcast hops;denial-of-service attacks;energy inefficiency;flat routing;malicious nodes;packet drop ratio;secure routing methodology;semirandomised propagation;static wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.","","978-1-4244-4153-2","978-0-7695-3650-7","10.1109/MDM.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security","","9","","41","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security.

Many works have been proposed to improve DFAs, especially in terms of memory consumption and speed. Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers. The result is that speed scales as the number of processing units.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-9266-4","978-1-4244-9267-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134010","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Instruction sets;Memory management;Multicore processing;Synchronization","buffer storage;deterministic automata;finite automata;inspection;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;pattern matching;performance evaluation;sampling methods;security of data","DFA parallelization;buffer reordering;buffer requirements;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;multicore systems;packet processing time reduction;parallel systems;regular expression matching performance;sampling technique;text expression","","0","","14","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729","Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput","automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead","","1","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3","978-1-4244-6939-0","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional intrusion detection systems have been unable to meet new security requirements. This paper proposes a collaborative intrusion detection model based on multi-agents. In this model, four kinds of agents are defined, which are organized in a hierarchical structure. The basic agents in every host or at the entrances of subnets are responsible for performing the simple detection and response tasks. The complicated collaboration task is executed by some separate coordination agents, which are responsible for synthetically analyzing the suspicious behavior that the lower-level agents are unable to identify. Coordination agents are also able to assign the task to the lower-level associated agents. Based on the hierarchical structure, the formal description of the model is given. By adaptive policies and dynamic association among some elements, this model provides dynamic adaptability to the changing environment and attacks. In addition, this paper also proposes the concept of coordination domain which facilitates the management of collaborative detection. The model lays a theoretical foundation for constructing dynamically adaptive intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-0721-5","","10.1109/CSSS.2012.202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394440","collaborative detection;coordination domain;intrusion detection;multi-agent","Adaptation models;Barium;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Economic indicators;Intrusion detection","computer network security;multi-agent systems","collaboration task;collaborative detection;collaborative intrusion detection model;computer network;coordination agents;dynamically adaptive intrusion detection system;hierarchical structure;multiagents;security requirements","","2","","3","","","11-13 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

Such rate limiting schemes drop all excess-traffic when the request arrival rate goes above a certain empirically calculated threshold. Flooding based DoS/DDoS attacks like TCP SYN Attack does not exhibit any special signature except that their arrival-rate is high enough to overwhelm the victim. Hence it is very difficult to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic as they share the same signature. As a result, rate limiting schemes cause heavy collateral damage by dropping out legitimate traffic [15]. In this paper we propose a novel packet marking mechanism which not only mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by filtering but also reduces collateral damage significantly by selectively dropping attack packets based on its packet mark while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed smoothly. Our packet mark contains fingerprint of the path in each single packet which allows us in identifying attack packets coming from various sources even in case of IP spoofing. Our scheme does not require any protocol specific knowledge and can generically filter out attack packets for all kinds of flooding attacks. We have extensively evaluated our packet marking scheme.

"Intrusion detection system- An efficient way to thwart against Dos/DDos attack in the cloud environment","Aishwarya, R.; Malliga, S.","Dept. of CSE, Kongu Eng. Coll., Erode, India","Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT), 2014 International Conference on","20141229","2014","","","1","6","One of the emerging and glooming technologies in the IT is Cloud computing where the information is permanently stored in the third party cloud servers and cached temporarily on clients that include different devices like desktops, entertainment centers, table computers, notebooks, wall computers, sensors, etc. Internet connection is the basic requirement for accessing the cloud. Virtualization technology is another technology which goes along with the cloud environment which is used most widely to reduce the cost purchasing the hardware infrastructures in organizations. Henceforth, the Cloud Computing Systems can be easily intruded by various types of cyber attacks including Denial of Serv-ice (DoS) attack and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which utilize the entire resources like CPU, Memory, etc and makes the server to starve. This creates a major impact reducing the efficiency of the virtual machines. In the proposed method, attack can be overcome by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Mitigation Strategy which uses the SYN Cookie to prevent the attack in the cloud to prevent the attack in which the server ignores the connection packets when it does not receive the correct Acknowledgement (ACK) from the client which requested the connection. The server here has rules to be check whether it is a legitimate client or the spoofed one using the first layer of security for hop count filtering mechanism and second layer of security is encoding the sequence number of the SYN packet so that only a legitimate client can decode it. Additionally security is also provided for the data packets using the Message Authentication Code (MAC) and thus client is authenticated.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996163","DoS/DDoS;Hop-Count Filtering;Message Authentication Code;SYN Cookie;Sequence number;Virtualization","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Filtering;IP networks;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;message authentication;transport protocols","ACK;CPU resource;DDos attack;Internet connection;MAC;SYN cookie;SYN packet;TCP mitigation strategy;Transmission Control Protocol mitigation strategy;acknowledgement;authenticated client;cloud access;cloud computing systems;connection packets;cyber attacks;data packets;distributed denial-of-service attack prevention;hardware infrastructures;hop count filtering mechanism;intrusion detection system;legitimate client;memory resource;message authentication code;purchasing cost reduction;security layer;sequence number encoding;spoofed client;temporarily cached information storage;third-party cloud servers;virtual machines;virtualization technology","","0","","14","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Third International Conference on","20090821","2009","","","114","120","This paper focuses on the enforcement of security properties fitting with dynamic mandatory access control policies. It adds complementary results to previous works of the authors in order to better address dynamic policies. Previous works of the authors provide several advances for enforcing the security of MAC system.An administration language for formalizing a large set of security properties is available to system administrators. That language uses several flow operators and ease the formalization of the required security properties. A solution is also available for computing the possible violations of any security property that can be formalized using our language. That solution computes several flow graphs in order to find all the allowed activities that can violate the requested properties. That paper addresses remaining problems related to the enforcement of the same kind of properties but with dynamic MAC policies. Enforcement is more much complex if we consider dynamic policies since the states of those policies are theoretically infinite. A new approach is proposed for dynamic MAC policies. The major idea is to use a meta-policy language for controlling the allowed evolutions of those dynamic policies. According to those meta-policy constraints, the computation problem becomes easier. The proposed solution adds meta-nodes within the considered flow graphs. A general algorithm is given for computing the required meta-nodes and the associated arcs. The proposed meta-graphs provide an overestimation of the possible flows between the different meta-nodes. The computation of the possible violations within the allowed dynamic policies is thus allowed. Several concrete security properties are considered using regular expressions for identifying the requested meta-contexts. The resulting violations, within the allowed meta-graphs, are computed and real violations are presented.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211030","","Access control;Concrete;Flow graphs;Information security;Linux;Mechanical factors;Operating systems;Permission;Protection;Safety","authorisation;graph theory;telecommunication security","dynamic mandatory access control policies;flow graphs;meta-policy constraints;security properties fitting","","0","","16","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, by means of the Kullback-Leibler divergence we are able to obtain great improvements with respect to the performance of the ""classical"" approach. Moreover we also introduce a method for identifying the flows responsible for an anomaly detected at the aggregated level.

It is observed that existing intrusion detection methods usually research all data in the network as a whole. However, in reality, data in the network can be categorized into two types: upward IP data and downward IP data. These two types of IP data may play different roles in intrusion detection process. Based on this observation, a novel intrusion detection method called Duplex Traffic Joint Analyzing(DTJA) method is proposed so as to consider both upward and downward IP data more specifically. With this method, intrusion clues can be found more effectively and efficiently. Experiment results indicate this method is feasible.","","978-1-4673-2238-6","978-1-4673-2236-2","10.1109/ICInfA.2012.6246794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246794","Downward IP Data;Intrusion detection;Upward IP Data","Data privacy;Dictionaries;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machines;Vectors","IP networks;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","DTJA method;downward IP data;duplex traffic joint analyzing method;heterogeneous IP data;intrusion clues;intrusion detection improvement;intrusion detection process;network security;upward IP data","","0","","5","","","6-8 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, this approach is based on the dynamic reconfiguration of the file access right for system calls or logs (e.g., file rewritability) with balanced adaptability and vulnerability. Based on an information-theoretic analysis on the coherently associations of adaptability, autonomy as well as vulnerability, a generic solution is suggested to break down their coherent links. The principle is to maximize context-situation awared systems' adaptability and reduce systems' vulnerability simultaneously. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed biological behaviour-inspired vulnerability awareness system.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.090313.120388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599023","Vulnerability assessment;agent-based system;intrusion detection system (IDS);management information base (MIB);threats awareness analysis","Computer security;Intrusion detection;Management information systems;Measurement uncertainty;Multi-agent systems;Next generation networking;Service-oriented architecture","file organisation;multi-agent systems;security of data;service-oriented architecture;ubiquitous computing","agent based self-adaptable context aware network vulnerability assessment;computer security;dynamic reconfiguration;file access;file rewritability;human immune system;information theoretic analysis;next generation service oriented network operation system","","0","","35","","","September 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Through the implementation of network sensors that monitor the network in real-time, we are capable to dynamically prevent, detect or limit the scope of attempted intrusions or other types of occurrences to the DNS service.
