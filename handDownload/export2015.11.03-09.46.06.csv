The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security. This paper focuses on strong security by detecting and preventing attacks, also ensures data authentication, integrity of data and solves less power transmission of data and receiver collision problem, by deploying hybrid mechanism.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164714","AODV;CAWS;EAACK;MES-1;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor network","Communication system security;Encryption;Intrusion detection;Standards;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV scheme;CAWS;EAACK mechanism;MES-1;ad hoc on demand distance vector scheme;attack prevention;black-hole attack detection;cryptography method;data authentication;data integrity;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;gray-hole attack detection;intrusion detection system;modern encryption standard;receiver collision problem;wireless sensor network security","","0","","17","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These Networks are used in many applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information therefore security is important in WSNs. Routing attacks can have devastating effect on wireless Sensor Network and present a major challenge when designing security mechanisms. Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack. The algorithm detects sinkhole node by finding the difference of nodes sequence numbers using threshold value. It also shows performance evaluation of AODV with the enhanced secure routing algorithm and existing secure routing algorithm through simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm by considering performance metrics as Throughput, PDR and Packet loss. Simulation is carried out using simulator NS2.","","978-1-4799-6084-2","","10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226170","AODV;Mobile Agent;Sinkhole Attack;Threshold Value;Wireless sensor Networks","Cryptography;Mobile agents;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV based secure routing algorithm;NS2 simulator;destructive routing attack;fake routing information;malicious node detection;mobile agent;packet loss;performance evaluation;performance metrics;security mechanisms;wireless sensor networks","","0","","13","","","5-7 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The disallowable policy enforcers will alert only on events that are known to be bad while the allowable policy enforcer will alert on events that deviate from those that have been classified as good. However, these trade-offs become difficult to balance in a recent time due to the complexity of computer attacks. Accordingly, intrusion detectors generate tons of alerts that may signify realistic and false attacks. Most often, failed attacks are erroneously predicted and processed while classification trees that should have given detail descriptions of each clusters of the attacks are poorly constructed. This is because the qualities of clustering schemes that are generated are not evaluated with an appropriate model. Consequently, attacks in progress are not forestalled despite alerts that intrusion detectors generate beforehand. Therefore, this paper presents category utility paradigm for showing a good way of using clustering algorithm to partition audit trails. Series of evaluations showed how to adopt guessing strategy to improve the efficacy of intrusion detections.","","978-1-4244-9029-5","","10.1109/CEEC.2010.5606488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5606488","Overlapping cluster;failed attacks;intrusion detection system","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Prediction algorithms","computer network security;pattern classification;pattern clustering;trees (mathematics)","classification trees;clustering algorithm;computer attack;guessing strategy;intrusion detection;policy enforcers;utility paradigm","","1","","14","","","8-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing is proposed in this paper. Our technique relies more on the data stream corresponding to ECG beats than any particular feature. We use the concept of shared counters to minimize the memory requirement while efficiently shifting through suspicious strings. The algorithm automatically adjusts parameters periodically to adapt to ECG changes as QRS morphology and heart rate.

Different techniques such as data mining and pattern recognition are being used to design IDS. One of the major challenges faced while designing IDSs is maximizing the accuracy of detection. To address this issue, this paper has used Ensemble of classifiers approach where each class uses different learning paradigm.

Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches.

In this paper, we propose Bloom-1, a new data structure that performs membership check in one memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a classical Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this new family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller and comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected. The soundness of these constraints was verified using a formal framework, and a prototype implementation of the sensor was evaluated with realistic AMI network traffic.","","978-1-4577-2005-5","978-0-7695-4590-5","10.1109/PRDC.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133080","AMI;formal method;intrusion detection;specification-based security","Authentication;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Reliability;Timing","automatic meter reading;computer network security;formal specification;power distribution reliability;power meters;power system measurement;power system security;sensors;smart power grids;transport protocols","AMI network traffic;C12.22 standard protocol;access points;advanced metering infrastructure;energy distribution infrastructure reliability;innovative situational awareness solutions;modernized power grid security;security policy;security threat identify;sensor;smart meters;specification based intrusion detection;traffic monitoring","","31","","34","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper,we present a host-based framework for the cost-sensitive assessment and selection of intrusion response.

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","","978-1-4673-4942-0","978-1-4673-4940-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. And practically all of them require some kind of termination in network connections. So, the quest for betterment continues.

Through the frequent transmission of beacons containing pseudonyms and telematic data like speed, acceleration and location of the vehicles, attackers are able to track VANET users. To address this problem, several privacy concepts have been proposed in the past to protect the participants. These concepts often work with a single centralized provider, require radio silence or are restricted to defense only. This can lead to weak protection or to major restrictions of VANET functionality. In this paper we propose the concept of “Defending and Attacking” to overcome these issues.","","978-1-4673-5615-2","978-1-4673-5614-5","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549052","","Encryption;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Privacy;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","data privacy;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET;beacon transmission;defending and attacking concept;defense restriction;participant privacy protection;pseudonym data;radio silence;single centralized provider;telematic data;vehicular ad hoc network","","1","","27","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The commonly deployed security devices are firewall, IDS, IPS, anti-virus etc. Potential number of threats is still pervading which are formulated as attacks by combining many unnoticed primitive events. The best solution is to install a Complex Event Processing (CEP) system which can analyze multiple devices to infer attack patterns. Log information of network devices is the best choice for analysis. In a large network, there will be millions of events logged. Correlated analysis of this huge volume of log is the main challenge in Complex Event Processing (CEP) system. We describe a method to reduce the input to the Complex Event Processing (CEP) system, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Therefore, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been created. Subsequently, IDSs have become an important part of modern networks to detect suspicious attacks. Modern networks expand and operate at high speeds, which is why handling all network traffic without overlooking security issues is difficult for IDS that run on a single processor. In this paper, we proposed a shared memory design called Hybrid Multi-Pattern Algorithm (HMA) as extension of our previous work, multi-core based HMA. The experiments show that GPGPU based HMA performs better than multi-core based HMA.

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection. The GA has been implemented to automatically provide the set of metrics that generate the most appropriate intrusion detection results.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956736","Automatic Labelling;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Network Traffic Labelling;Unsupervised Anomaly IDS","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Measurement;Telecommunication traffic","digital forensics;feature selection;genetic algorithms","GA based approach;automatic dataset labelling;feature selection;genetic algorithm;labelled network traffic dataset;offline forensic analysis;real-time implementation;supervised intrusion detection systems;unlabelled dataset;unsupervised anomaly based IDS","","1","","13","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Studies have shown that flow-based anomaly detection mechanisms give promising results as compared to typical signature based attack detection mechanisms which have not been able to detect such attacks effectively. For this purpose, a variety of flow-based DDoS detection algorithms have been put forward. We have divided the flow-based DDoS attack detection techniques broadly into two categories namely, packet header based and mathematical formulation based.

On this basis, the Nash equilibrium of attack-defense process of physical machine is computed in order to get the best defense strategy. The related theories of Petri net are used to verify the correctness of proposed method. The computation formula and the actual meaning of performance index are given.

In this approach, the feature values of the traffic data are first standardized to reduce statistical dependencies of local structural variations within a class and then normalized to isolate statistical inaccuracies between classes. A unit-circle is then constructed using two selected features. The unit-circle algorithm reveals that the normal and the back attack traffic in NSL-KDD datasets fall inside the normal and the abnormal classes respectively. Hence we have robust definitions for the back attack and normal traffic activities in a computer network based on NSL-KDD dataset.","","978-1-4673-2105-1","","10.1109/ISI.2012.6284275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6284275","back attack;classification;intrusion detection;labeled dataset;standard score","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robustness;Standards;USA Councils","computer network security;pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","NSL-KDD datasets;back attack characterization;computer network;intrusion detection;local structural variations;normal traffic;standard scores;statistical dependencies;unit-circle classification algorithm;unit-circle representation","","1","","11","","","11-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm is unable to eliminate false packets with short lifespan. Secondly, the algorithm lacks the capability to manage the trade-offs between false and true positives. Consequently, system administrators are frequently swamped with massive false alerts from intrusive packets that cannot achieve their objectives and unfortunately, such alerts are often mixed with few true positives. However, how to substantiate these two generic groups of alerts without incurring additional overheads are classical research issues. Therefore, we present clustering-based adaptive P-filter model to investigate false positives. Alerts from Snort were the input to the P-filter model and they were clustered with some sequential filtering criteria. Extensive evaluations that we performed have demonstrated high efficacy of our approach to collaborate with pattern matching algorithm in achieving significant reduction of false positives during intrusion detections.","","978-1-4244-5984-1","","10.1109/ISMS.2010.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416121","false positive;intrusion aggregation;pattern matching;time to live;true positive","Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Detectors;Engines;Filtering;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance evaluation","computer network security;pattern clustering;pattern matching","Snort;clustering-based adaptive P-filter model;false positive reduction;network intrusion detection systems;pattern matching algorithm;sequential filtering criteria","","2","","25","","","27-29 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base 64-encoded image, Base 64-encoded text and Encrypted).

With the distributed system framework, we can analyze a whole data set of KDD'99 by first applying our preprocessing. In addition, we use an anomaly detection model for log analysis. A key challenge is to make anomaly detection work more accurately. For the Kmeans algorithm, a key challenge is to set the appropriate number of the initial cluster (K).

Protection of information access, availability and data integrity represents the basic security characteristics desired on information sources. Any disruption of these properties would result in system intrusion and the related security risk. Advanced decoy based technology called Honeypot has a huge potential for the security community and can achieve several goals of other security technologies, which makes it almost universal. Paper is devoted to sophisticated hybrid Honeypot with autonomous feature that allows to, based on the collected system parameters, adapt to the system of deployment. By its presence Honeypot attracts attacker by simulating vulnerabilities and poor security. After initiation of interaction Honeypot will record all attacker activities and after data analysis allows improving security in computer systems.","","978-1-4673-5928-3","978-1-4673-5927-6","10.1109/SAMI.2013.6480993","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6480993","","Computer architecture;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","data integrity;security of data","IT;autonomous hybrid solution;computer system security;data integrity protection;decoy based technology;honeypot mechanism;information access protection;information availability protection;information technology;security risk;system intrusion","","1","","16","","","Jan. 31 2013-Feb. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It protects virtual and physical computer networks against threats and vulnerabilities. Presently, machine learning techniques are widely extended to implement effective intrusion detection system. Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model. The proposed ensemble method provides competitively low false positives compared with other machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155853","Bagging;Ensemble;False positives;Machine learning;REPTree;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","NSL-KDD dataset;REPTree;classification accuracy;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;neural network;physical computer networks;statistical models;using bagging ensemble method;virtual computer networks","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we simulate several cyberattacks using a modified version of a NSL-KDD dataset that is applicable in any desired BPLC network. The nodes are mainly metering and controlling devices that handle the consumed Internet traffic plus electricity bill. The communicational protocol for our network is IEEE 1901 which is a standard protocol among broadband communication devices that work in a BPLC network. In the main part of our simulations, we have benefited from three types of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) using two Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithms as well as an algorithm based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). At the end of our simulations, we compare these three Intrusion Detection Systems according to FPR, FNR, and DR criteria. Simulation results show that with our modified dataset and methods we can ensure a pretty high accuracy in intrusion detection and prevention in the home area of a desired BPLC network.","","978-1-4799-8313-1","","10.1109/SGC.2014.7150704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150704","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);Artificial mmune System (AIS);Broadband Power Line Communications (BPLC);Cybersecurity;Data Classification;Home-Area Network (HAN);Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Support Vector Machine (SVM);Unified Smart Grid (USG)","Broadband communication;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing;Smart grids;Support vector machines","Internet;artificial immune systems;carrier transmission on power lines;computer network security;home networks;protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","AIS;BLPC network;DR criteria;FNR criteria;FPR criteria;IDS;Internet traffic;NSL-KDD dataset;SVM;artificial immune system algorithm;broadband power line communications;communicational protocol;controlling device;cyber attacks analysis;electricity bill;home-area section;intrusion detection systems;is IEEE 1901;metering device;support vector machines","","0","","","","","9-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we show that both the attacker and the defender can apply estimation techniques and learning methods to obtain the key information of the environment and thus design better strategies. We further demonstrate that the advanced attack strategy can defeat the naive defense technique that focuses only on the received signal power, whereas the advanced defense strategy that exploits the invariant of communication channels can counteract the advanced attack effectively.","1097-2641","978-1-4244-5737-3","","10.1109/PCCC.2009.5403815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403815","","Chaotic communication;Cognitive radio;Communication channels;Emulation;Information security;Intelligent networks;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Probability distribution;Signal design","cognitive radio;radio networks","cognitive radio networks;communication channels;emulation attacks;emulation defenses;estimation techniques;learning methods","","8","","22","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show disadvantages of existing common log formats for normalisation of security events. To deal with it we have created a new log format that fits for intrusion detection purposes and can be extended easily. Taking previous work into account, we would like to propose a new format as an extension to existing common log formats, rather than a standalone specification.","","978-1-4799-2989-4","","10.1109/ISIAS.2013.6947748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6947748","common log format;intrusion detection;log normalisation","Bridges;Kernel;Receivers;Servers","security of data;system monitoring","hierarchical object log format;intrusion detection systems;security event normalisation","","1","","20","","","4-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
