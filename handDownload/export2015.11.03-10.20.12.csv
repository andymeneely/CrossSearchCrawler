The technology of intrusion detection is an important component of network security. The traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) generally has the following disadvantages: the first one is that it could not detect the new type attacks even the variation of existed attacks; the second one is the detection time is so long that the real-time capability of the system is low. In this paper we proposed a new model based on LLE and BVM to solve the problems mentioned above. This model is different from traditional IDS, we use BVM classifier to differentiate the normal and abnormal attacks, and we added a pre-process module before the classifier. In the pre-process module, we use LLE to extract the main features of the intrusion data, which is the main part of the pre-process module, and then the principal components of the data are used as input of BVM classifier that differentiates the normal and abnormal actions. Applying this proposed system to KDDCUP99 data, experimental results clearly illustrates that this model has a remarkable performance in detecting both existed instruction and new ones.","","978-1-4244-8104-0","978-1-4244-8106-4","10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636736","BVM;IDS;LLE;component;feature extraction","Databases;Probes","Internet;computer network security;pattern classification","BVM classifier;Internet;KDDCUP99 data;LLE;intrusion detection system;network attacks;network security","","0","","13","","","18-19 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed genetic algorithm uses a set of classification rules which are generated from a predefined intrusion behavior. From the results it could be concluded that if crossover performed is not sufficient, there is not sufficient sharing of genes. If we crossover too much, good segments of individuals get split up a lot.

Anomaly intrusion detection approaches have the advantage of detecting previously unknown or new attacks, but suffer from the possible high false alarms due to the problem of behavior drifting and the difficulty of building an adaptive model. In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - naïve Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as “normal” or “anomalous” to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification. Experimental results in a data set consisting of both normal and intrusion traces show that the model can successfully detect most of intrusion traces with a very low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4673-1713-9","978-1-4673-1712-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377776","Anomaly Intrusion Detection;Data Mining;Fuzzy Logic;Naïve Bayes Classifiers;Privileged Processes;System Calls","Data mining;Data models;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Training data","data mining;fuzzy logic;pattern classification;probability;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection approach;anomaly-based IDS;data mining technique;false alarm rate;fuzzy logic;input event classification;intrusion trace;misuse IDS;naive Bayes classification;probability;system call sequence","","0","","13","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in the FPGA, it is not able to be executed by the restriction on the structure. This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for the FPGA developed by the register-transfer level (RTL) design. Although the RTL design of the FPGA has various advantages, it is required for a high-speed design for a routing delay which is larger than that of a conventional FPGA. The method is timing adjustment using a connection block with the RTL design. Results of analysis of the connection block show that the seven stages of the delay adjustment are possible in the block. In addition, the block can be used for rough-tuning of delay times. It is the area of less than half of the logic block.","","","","10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207067","RTL design;connection block;delay times;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);fine-tuning;low-power design;wave-pipeline","Delays;Field programmable gate arrays;Routing;Switches;Throughput;Transistors;Tuning","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;logic design;pipeline processing","RTL design;delay time adjustment;field programmable gate arrays;high speed FPGA;low-power FPGA;pipeline operations;register transfer level design;wave pipeline fine tuning","","0","","13","","","24-27 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we investigate the use of keystroke data to distinguish between humans using keystroke biometric systems and non-humans for auditing application. Recently, Benford's Law and Zipf's Law, which are both discrete Power law probability distributions, have been effectively used to detect fraud and discriminate between genuine data and fake/tampered data. As such, our motivation is to apply the Benford's Law and Zipf's Law on keystroke data and to determine whether they follow these laws and discriminate between humans using keystroke biometric systems from non-humans. From the results, we observe that, the latency values of the keystroke data from humans actually follow the Benford's law and Zipf's law, but not the duration values. This implies that, latency values from humans would follow the two laws, whereas the latency values from non-humans would deviate from the Benford's law and Zipf's law. Even though, the duration values from humans deviates from the Benford's law, they do follow a pattern that we can develop an accurate model for the duration values. We perform experiments using the benchmark data set developed by Killourhy and Maxion, CMU [1] and obtain divergences of 0.0008, 0.029 and 0.05 for the keyup-keydown (latency), keydown-keydown, and duration of the keystroke data, respectively. Moreover, P-value's of 0.7770, 0.6230 and 0.0160 are obtained for the keyup-keydown (latency), keydown-keydown, and duration of the keystroke data, respectively. We observe that the latency (which is the time elapsed between release of the first key and pressing down of the next key) is one of the most important features used by administrators for auditing purposes to detect anomalies during their employees logging into their company system.","","","","10.1109/IWBF.2015.7110238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110238","Benford???s law;Keystroke Dynamics;Zipf???s law","Companies;Data models;Databases;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Polynomials;Standards","biometrics (access control);digital forensics;fraud;statistical distributions","Benford's law;Zipf's law;anomaly detection;auditing application;biometrics traits;data forensic techniques;discrete power law probability distributions;fraud detection;keydown-keydown;keystroke biometric systems;keystroke dynamics;keyup-keydown","","0","","26","","","3-4 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","3","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide new insights for effective defense. But most of existing understandings are based on indirect traffic measures (e.g., backscatters) or traffic seen locally. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed in a seven-month period. These attacks were launched by 674 botnets from 23 different botnet families with a total of 9,026 victim IPs belonging to 1,074 organizations in 186 countries. Our analysis reveals several interesting findings about today's Internet DDoS attacks. Some highlights include: (1) geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families, (2) from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families, (3) there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn. These findings add to the existing literature on the understanding of today's Internet DDoS attacks, and offer new insights for designing new defense schemes at different levels.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266866","","Cities and towns;Computer crime;Geology;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Organizations","IP networks;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet DDoS attacks;Internet distributed denial-of-service;botnet families;geolocation analysis;geospatial distribution;indirect traffic measures;interattack time interval;source prediction;start time prediction;victim IP","","","","","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this mode of operation serves as a vulnerability amplifier because each computer executes multiple versions of the same operating code base carrying the same vulnerabilities. This paper explores techniques for the system's run-time loader to generate diversity from a single binary source. In addition, we describe compile-time techniques that can augment and enhance the diversity gained through the run-time system alone. Collectively, the techniques randomize the code and data of the binary eliminating vulnerability amplification. Entropy is used as a measure of diversity and we explore the entropy gained by the techniques under several different assumptions concerning the attackers knowledge of the system. The techniques have been implemented into Bear, a from-scratch hypervisor and microkernel designed to run military cloud applications that require resilience.","","978-1-4799-3963-3","","10.1109/THS.2013.6699037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6699037","computer security;information security","Entropy;Geophysical measurement techniques;Ground penetrating radar;Kernel;Programming;Runtime;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;military computing;resource allocation","Bear hypervisor;binary source;cloud computing;cloud systems diversity;compile-time relocation;cost savings;entropy;microkernel;military cloud applications;resource savings;runtime loader;shared resources;virtual machines;vulnerability amplification;vulnerability amplifier","","0","","37","","","12-14 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system. Regular nodes monitor continuously to evaluate their neighbors using belief updating systems of the Bayes rule.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2015.000012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059537","Bayes rule;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE);secure routing;strategy","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Mobile computing;Receivers;Routing protocols","Bayes methods;cryptographic protocols;game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MANETs;PBE strategy;anonymous behaviors;belief updating systems;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;game theory model;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;perfect Bayesian equilibrium;regular nodes;reputation system;secure routing protocol;security attacks","","0","","","","","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performance evaluation is performed in terms of the detection probability, false alarm rate, detection delay and the robustness of the algorithms to different detection threshold values. The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities. Next, we use the Dempster-Shafer algorithm to fuse the outputs provided by the above locally executed algorithms at different nodes, thus forming a collaborative intrusion detection system.

However P2P systems can be potential vehicle for active worms which can spread in all manager peers in a short time. This issue has not been studied in the literature. In this paper we address effects of active worm propagation in a P2P network management system in which nodes are structured in several hierarchal levels. We intend to evaluate the speed of propagation in the system. To aim at this goal, we perform extensive simulation study and investigate the parameters influencing the speed of propagation such as the number of vulnerable host managers, degree of connections between peer managers inside the groups, the number of connections between different groups of managers in the hierarchical structure. We further compare worm propagation in different levels of hierarchy by different types of active worm attack strategies. We show that in addition to P2P parameters hierarchical structure affect the speed of active worm propagation. This issue suggests that P2P network management systems are more vulnerable in comparison to classical NMSs when they face to security attacks. Therefore to realize implementation of P2P NMSs security concerns should be taken into account.","","978-1-4244-4423-6","978-0-7695-3696-5","10.1109/CTRQ.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5176069","Active Worm Attacks;Network Management Systems;P2P systems","Conference management;Equations;Information security;Peer to peer computing;Power system management;Quality management;Reliability theory;Technology management;Tin;Topology","computer network management;computer viruses;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security","P2P system;active worm attack strategies;active worm propagation;hierarchal level structure;hierarchical peer-to-peer network management system","","0","1","9","","","20-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Engineering a distributed control system having safety critical features, requiring real-time performance is challenging. In this follow-up article we introduce the communication framework for the microgrid scenario under investigation. In all communication networks, scholastic delays and performance are inherent.

Because the most important characteristic of self-organization is the restriction of interactions to neighboring elements (localized interactions), we extend the Â¿-Calculus with the locality awareness, a necessary abstraction to allow the modeling of self-organization in WSNs. To get full locality awareness in Â¿-Calculus we extended it with concepts for modeling spatiality, probability and time. Moreover, new types of channels are included in the Â¿-Calculus to include the different types of communication existing in a WSN: distribution, broadcast and aggregation. In order to validate our new PA, we successfully model a self-organizing clustering algorithm for WSNs.","","978-1-4244-3942-3","978-1-4244-3941-6","10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345551","Process algebra;ad hoc network;clustering;emergence;locality aware;pi-calculus;self-organization;wireless sensor network","Algebra;Broadcasting;Calculus;Clustering algorithms;Distributed control;Embedded system;Informatics;Probability;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","pi calculus;protocols;wireless sensor networks","process algebra;self-organizing behavior;self-organizing protocols;wireless sensor networks;Â¿-calculus","","0","","13","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ordinary intrusion detection systems usually deal with network or OS attacks and could not detect database specific attacks. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find temporal patterns and rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels using a hybrid approach, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5358-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000815","data mining;database security;inter-transaction rules;intrusion detection;specification;state machine","Data mining;Database systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","","","","0","","12","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we use two cost models. The first cost model assumes that all network intrusion detection devices have the same cost. The second model assumes that the cost of the device is relative to the traffic load on the network node on which it is installed. We evaluate two algorithms for finding the most prominent group in these cost models. The first algorithm is based on greedy choice of vertices and the second is based on heuristic search and finds the optimal deployment locations. We investigate combinations of heuristic functions based on solution cost and on solution utility and different node ordering strategies. We show that intelligent choice of the heuristic functions and node ordering can speed up the search. Empirical evaluation shows that while in the first cost model the greedy algorithm produces results that are negligibly close to optimal in the second cost model the difference between optimal and suboptimal solutions can be significant.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502182","","Communications Society;Cost function;Greedy algorithms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;search problems","DNIDS deployment utility;DNIPS;cost benefit deployment;cost model;group betweenness centrality;heuristic search;high-speed network;large-scale network;network intrusion detection devices;real time distributed network intrusion detection systems","","0","","27","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, no assumption can be made on the outcome of the attack, no assurance can be assumed once the system is compromised. The intrusion tolerance techniques focus on providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised. This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds. In particular, this work focuses on a specific Denial of Service attack, called Deeply-Nested XML.

With recent advances in the performance and viability of using GPUs for various highly-parallelised data processing tasks, a number of security challenges are raised. Unscrupulous software running subsequently on the same GPU, either by the same user, or another user, in a multi-user system, may be able to gain access to the contents of the GPU memory. This contains data from previous program executions. In certain use-cases, where the GPU is used to offload intensive parallel processing such as pattern matching for an intrusion detection system, financial systems, or cryptographic algorithms, it may be possible for the GPU memory to contain privileged data, which would ordinarily be inaccessible to an unprivileged application running on the host computer. With GPUs potentially yielding access to confidential information, existing research in the field is built upon, to investigate the practicality of extracting data from global, shared and texture memory, and retrieving this data for further analysis. These techniques are also implemented on various GPUs using three different Nvidia CUDA versions. A novel methodology for digital forensic examination of GPU memory for remanent data is then proposed, along with some suggestions and considerations towards countermeasures and anti-forensic techniques.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140493","","Digital forensics;Graphics processing units;Memory management;Random access memory;Remanence","digital forensics;graphics processing units;memory architecture;parallel architectures;pattern matching","CUDA graphics processing units;GPU memory;Nvidia CUDA GPU;antiforensic techniques;confidential information access;cryptographic algorithms;data remanence;data retrieval;digital forensic;financial systems;global-shared texture memory;highly-parallelised data processing tasks;host computer;intrusion detection system;memory attacks;multiuser system;offload intensive parallel processing;pattern matching;privileged data;program executions;unprivileged application","","0","","24","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although an HTTPS compatible scheme is necessary for many online services, several previously proposed defense schemes fail to combine both HTTPS compatibility with practicality. In this paper, a novel defense architecture that blocks malicious traffic far from the protected servers is proposed. Protected servers are hidden inside a secure overlay network only accessible through a set of access-nodes (AN) with rate limiting and access control functionalities. Protected servers are required to provide at least one dummy public server as an initial connection step point. An experimental prototype is implemented and tested. Results show; system compatibility with e-commerce websites needs, also, the AN impact on the protected server performance is less than 10% reduction in file transfer throughput, in addition, the public server could survive attack rates more than 10 times higher than an ordinary server. Through discussion we demonstrate the system ability to protect the servers' resources from all attack types without sacrificing data integrity or confidentiality. To the best of our knowledge, we offer the first practical DDoS protection scheme fully compatible with HTTPS.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598153","DDoS protection;access control;e-commerce;internet security;privacy","Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Prototypes;Web server","access control;electronic commerce;security of data","DDoS floods;Internet security;access control;access-nodes;distributed denial of service attacks;e-commerce;;malicious traffic;online businesses;overlay network","","0","","17","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the worst case, simultaneous intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations of a power grid.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2294473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786500","Anomaly detection;GOOSE anomaly detection;SMV anomaly detection and intrusion detection;cyber security of substations","Circuit breakers;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Power grids;Substation automation","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;power system reliability;substation automation","ADS;GOOSE;IED;SMV;catastrophic power outages;circuit breakers;cyber intrusions;generic object oriented substation event;host-based anomaly detection systems;integrated anomaly detection system;intelligent electronic devices;malicious behaviors;multicast messages;network-based anomaly detection systems;physical security;power grid;sampled measured value;severe cascading events;simultaneous anomaly detection;simultaneous intrusion detection method;substation automation testbed;substation facilities;substations;temporal anomalies;user-interfaces","","1","","37","","2014-04-10","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, existing protocols which provide full anonymity of source node, destination node and routes are vulnerable to malicious activités. The anonymous protocols hide the identity of the malicious node and enhance the possibility of Black Hole Attack. In order to provide anonymity without compromising the security, we have extended Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing Protocol(ALERT) to make it secure. The secure version is named as Secure Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing protocol (S-ALERT). S-ALERT uses Suspect Detection algorithm to choose the nodes in a route which provide unperceivable route. If there is existence of a Black Hole it actually sends a false RREP packet and advertises itself as the shortest route found. The proposed scheme avoid the black hole problem, and also prevent the network from further malicious behavior. Through simulation results it has been shown that proposed method can effectively detect and provide protection from black hole attack. S-ALERT routing efficiency is also better than existing protocols.","","978-1-4799-6499-4","","10.1109/ICIINFS.2014.7036496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036496","Black hole attack;MANET;anonymity;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","MANET;S-ALERT;black hole attack problem;data traffic;destination node;false RREP packet;military operations;mobile ad hoc network;secure anonymous location-based efficient routing protocol;source node;suspect detection algorithm","","0","","11","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, normal and noisy datasets for network IDS domain are used and various classification algorithms are evaluated. The results show that an evaluation of algorithms without noise is misleading for IDSs since algorithms that perform best without noise do not necessarily achieve the same in a realistic noisy environment.

These shared resources, easy accessibility and shared storage of resources are responsible for putting the confidential information under a great deal of risk. Although the cloud is becoming gigantic day by day but its efficiency is being hampered considerably due to the threats in the cloud computing environment. The threats in the cloud computing environment not only account to external attacks which are launched with the intention of hampering work flow of the cloud provider but the internal attacks also which are being launched so that the efficiency and the reliability of the cloud is at stake. The firewalls monitor traffic between networks such that all the traffic must flow through it, but they are certainly not sufficient to shield the dynamic cloud computing environment from all attacks. They may be able to subvert external attacks to a certain extent but internal attacks do not even pass through the firewalls, therefore rendering them useless. Moreover, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the virtual machines in order to set up large scale attacks like Ddos. They compromise these VM's into zombies and the detection of these VM's is very difficult because cloud users install all types of applications onto their VM's some of which may be malicious. Thus, the cloud needs stronger security for handling all the intrusions of every scale. An intrusion detection system is presented in the paper which detects the intrusions launched on the VM's which act an avenue for deploying large scale attacks, therefore, minimising the loss.

"Robust and Fast Pattern Matching for Intrusion Detection","Namjoshi, K.; Narlikar, G.","Bell Labs., Alcatel-Lucent, Paris, France","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE","20100506","2010","","","1","9","The rule language of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a critical role in its effectiveness. A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness","backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data","Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language","","4","1","36","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an innovative packet classification algorithm, called partial paralleled algorithm based on plus bits (P3). P3 algorithm begins by two paralleled single-field engines and followed by hash table of the remained 3 fields. A novel structure, plus bits, is introduced to reduce hash memory accesses. For a 4k filterset, P3 algorithm can achieve about 9 memory accesses on average, taking 326 KB of memory for its data structure and supporting incremental update.

By having time series models, system administrators will be able to better plan resource allocation and system readiness to defend against malicious activities. In this paper, we address the knowledge gap by investigating the possible inclusion of a statistical based time series modeling that can be seamlessly integrated into existing cyber defense system. Cyber-attack processes exhibit long range dependence and in order to investigate such properties a new class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average (GARMA) can be used. In this paper, GARMA (1,2; δ,1) model is fitted to cyber-attack data sets. Three different estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters. The Hannan-Rissanen Algorithm, Whittle Estimation Method and Maximum Likelihood Estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters of the GARMA (1,2;δ,1). Point forecasts to predict the attack rate possibly hours ahead of time also has been done and the performance of the models and estimation methods are discussed. The investigation of the case-study will confirm that by exploiting the statistical properties, it is possible to predict cyber-attacks (at least in terms of attack rate) with good accuracy. This kind of forecasting capability would provide sufficient early-warning time for defenders to adjust their defense configurations or resource allocations.","","978-1-4799-7625-6","","10.1109/NSITNSW.2015.7176399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176399","Communication Systems;Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average;Intrusion forecasting;Long range dependence;Predictive modeling","Autoregressive processes;Computational modeling;Forecasting;Hidden Markov models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Predictive models","autoregressive moving average processes;maximum likelihood estimation;resource allocation;security of data;time series","ARMA models;GARMA models;Hannan-Rissanen algorithm;Whittle estimation method;communication systems;cyber defense system;cyber-attack processes;generalized autoregressive moving average;intrusion detection systems;maximum likelihood estimation methods;parameter estimation;predictive modeling;resource allocation;time series modeling","","0","","17","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the SIP is gaining popularity, open architecture of VoIP often makes SIP vulnerable to so many threats. The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT. This paper has provided the effective mechanism in creating well-formed defense against malicious SIP message attacks to ensure the integrity and security of VoIP subsystems.","","","","10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083519","Intrusion detection system;Malicious message;SIP;SQL injection;VoIP","Inspection;Internet;Protocols;Security;Servers;Standards;Syntactics","Internet telephony;client-server systems;computer network security;digital signatures;public domain software;signalling protocols;virtual machines","BackTrack7;IDS;Kphone;SER;SIP clients;SIP server;SIP-based infrastructure security;SIPSAK;SNORT;Session Initiation Protocol;VMware;VoIP communication;VoIP subsystem integrity;VoIP subsystem security;Voice over Internet Protocol communication;Windows 7;X-lite;attack signature generation technique;attack-signature generation framework;attacking tool;configuration file;detection rule improvement;intrusion detection system;logical error identification;malformed SIP message identification;malicious SIP message attacks;malicious SIP messages;malicious message attacks;malicious message identification;open architecture;open source IDS;open source SIP server;processing overheads;regular expression;security mechanisms;signaling protocol;signature database;testbed architecture;threat vulnerability;virtual environment","","0","","8","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.<sup>1</sup>","","978-1-4673-7556-6","","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208645","","Authentication;Linear regression;Performance evaluation;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Internet of Things;Zigbee;ad hoc networks","Internet of Things;RF-fingerprinting;ZigBee ad-hoc networks;ZigBee devices;nonparametric classifier random forest;nonparametric feature generation","","0","","22","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A packet dropping attack is one of the major security threats in OppNets as neither source nodes nor destination nodes have any knowledge of when or where a packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a novel attack and detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping where the malicious node drops one packet or more and injects a new fake packet instead. Our novel detection mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. It relies on a very simple yet powerful idea, the creation time of each packet.

The nodes in a wireless sensor network are grouped into clusters based on the special relationships with a cluster head in each cluster. The proposed scheme firstly uses a clustering algorithm to build a model of normal traffic behavior, and then uses this model of normal traffic to detect abnormal traffic patterns. According to the different network conditions of clusters, this scheme also can dynamically set different detection parameters for different clusters to achieve a more appropriate detection algorithm. The performance analysis shows that the proposed intrusion detection scheme can improve the detection accuracy and drop the false positive rate, and is highly efficient of the energy conservation.","2154-4824","978-1-4673-4497-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6321069","Anomaly detection;Ddynamic intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","0","","9","","","24-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Con sequently, flow-based ID is gaining attention as an effective complement. ID systems are furthermore often characterized as either network-based or host-based. The autonomous multi agent design paradigm is a scalable, attractive alternative for its potential to leverage the strengths of both architectures: the broad perspective and visibility into distributed malicious activity provided by network-based ID, and the comprehensive view of the local node provided by host-based ID. This paper therefore develops an architecture for a new multi agent, flow-based intrusion detection sysem. The architecture is designed in two iterations of increasing complexity. These innovative ID designs use a ""repuation"" system to permit agents to dynamically find nodes that are most effective for classifying malicious network activity. Furthermore, each system design includes the development of an innovative classifier that uses multi objective evolutionary algorithms to aid in the search for effective operational parameter values. Evaluation using an extensive agent simulation framework highlights the conditions under which the reputation system provides a significant classification benefit.","Pending","978-1-4244-7834-7","","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949798","","Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Object oriented modeling;Pattern recognition;Peer to peer computing","computer network security;multi-agent systems;telecommunication traffic","autonomous multiagent design;computer network protection;flow-based ID;flow-based intrusion detection;malicious network activity classification;malicious traffic;network attack classification;signature-based ID","","1","2","17","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks. This paper proposes a secure wake up scheme that activates a sensor node by a secure wake up radio from a sleep state only if messages from an authenticated and legitimate node are pending. A lightweight security verification scheme is used that can easily be performed without requiring the node to change to active state.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211020","security;wake-up radio;wireless sensor network","Batteries;Communication standards;Communication switching;Cryptography;Protection;Security;Sleep;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4;battery powered sensor node;energy saving sleep state;frame cryptographic protection;lightweight security verification scheme;personal area networks;secure wake up scheme;sleep deprivation attack;wireless sensor network","","5","","16","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The adversary, however, can also exploit such knowledge to its advantage. To understand the interplay underlying this problem, we formulate a Bayesian model, where the IDS faces a scanning allocation dilemma: if the intruder has no knowledge, then all the bands are under equal threat, while if the intruder has complete knowledge, then less-protected bands are more likely to be threatened. We solve this dilemma and show the optimal IDS strategy switches between the optimal response to these threats. Finally, we show that the strategy might be sensitive to prior knowledge, which can be corrected by adapted learning.","","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178269","Bayesian game;Spectrum scanning;intrusion detection system","Bandwidth;Bayes methods;Games;Interference;Intrusion detection;Signal to noise ratio;Switches","Bayes methods;access protocols;radio spectrum management;security of data","Bayesian model;dynamic spectrum access scenarios;equal threat;intrusion detection system;less-protected bands;malicious activity spectrum;malicious user detection;scanner capability;scanning allocation dilemma;scanning effectiveness;spectrum scanning protocol","","0","","20","","","19-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected. To maintain data integrity and for prevention of black / gray hole attack hash function is used.","","978-1-4799-6895-4","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014732","AODV;Black hole;Cooperative Black hole;MANET;gray hole","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;AODV protocol;MANET;ad hoc on demand distance vector;black hole attack prevention;black-gray hole attack hash function;dynamic topology;geographical position;hash function;malevolent node;mobile ad hoc networks;physical security;wireless connectivity;wireless network","","0","","13","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity. Further, we also examined whether FCM clustering and RKM clustering can help to determine class of ambiguous packets exactly or approximately.

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members.

Their purpose is to protect critical information systems and information; this is complemented by acquisition of information about the network threats, attackers and attacks. It is very important to consider issues affecting the deployment and usage of the honeypots and honeynets. This paper discusses the legal issues of honeynets considering their generations. Paper focuses on legal issues of core elements of honeynets, especially data control, data capture and data collection. Paper also draws attention on the issues pertaining to privacy and liability. The analysis of legal issues is based on EU law and it is supplemented by a review of the research literature, related to legal aspects of honeypots and honeynets.","","978-1-4799-5478-0","","10.1109/ECAI.2014.7090212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090212","EU law;honeynet;legal issues;liability;privacy","Data collection;Firewalls (computing);Law;Privacy;Production","computer network security;data protection;law","EU law;critical information system protection;data capture;data collection;data control;data liability;data privacy;honeynet;honeypots;information acquisition;legal issues;network attacks;network threats;security measures","","0","","28","","","23-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"iHAC: A Hybrid Access Control Framework for IaaS Clouds","Chao Zhou; Bo Li","State Key Lab. of Software Dev. Environ., Beihang Univ., Beijing, China","Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC), 2014 IEEE/ACM 7th International Conference on","20150202","2014","","","853","858","Cloud computing, as an emerging computing paradigm, greatly facilitates resource sharing and enables providing computing power as services over the Internet. However, it also brings new challenges for security and access control, especially in IaaS clouds. The introduction of virtualization layer increases new security risks which should be restricted and confined by more stringent access control techniques. In this paper, we propose a hybrid access control framework, named iHAC, which combines the advantages of both Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Type Enforcement (TE) model to enable unified access control and authorization for IaaS clouds. A permission transition model is provided to dynamically assign permission to virtual machines. A VMM-based access control mechanism is designed to confine the VM's behaviors in a fine-grained manner. Ihac is implemented and evaluated in iVIC platform. The experimental results show that our proposed framework is effective and efficient.","","","","10.1109/UCC.2014.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027606","IaaS cloud;hybrid access control;virtual machine","Authorization;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Virtualization","authorisation;cloud computing;virtual machines","IaaS clouds;Internet;RBAC;VMM;authorization;cloud computing;hybrid access control framework;iHAC;permission transition model;resource sharing;role-based access control;security risk;type enforcement model;virtual machine;virtualization layer","","0","","19","","","8-11 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the sensitive and confidential nature of the data involved, entities have to employ various anonymization techniques to meet legal requirements in compliance with confidentiality policies. Nevertheless, the very composition of network trace data makes it a challenge when applying anonymization techniques. On the other hand, basic application of microdata anonymization techniques on network traces is problematic and does not deliver the necessary data usability. Therefore, as a contribution, we point out some of the ongoing challenges in the network trace anonymization. We then suggest usability-aware anonymization heuristics by employing microdata privacy techniques while giving consideration to usability of the anonymized data. Our preliminary results show that with trade-offs, it might be possible to generate anonymized network traces with enhanced usability, on a case-by-case basis using micro-data anonymization techniques.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237310","Differential Privacy;Generalization;K-anonymity;Network Trace Anonymization;Usability","Cryptography;Data privacy;Databases;IP networks;Noise;Privacy;Usability","data privacy","anonymized network traces;collaborative research;confidentiality policies;data usability;microdata anonymization;microdata privacy;network trace data publication;network trace data sharing;usability-aware anonymization heuristics;usability-aware network trace anonymization","","0","","39","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Using parallel distributed reasoning for monitoring computing networks","Musman, S.","MITRE Corp., McLean, VA, USA","MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2010 - MILCOM 2010","20110106","2010","","","417","422","We describe a distributed reasoning system called Otto-Mate that is used to detect, reason about, and respond to incidents on a computing network. Events for monitoring computing networks occur at different system levels. Some information might relate to data, some might be operating system specific, some application or service related, some could be network related, and from each there will be compound events that describe incident effects and information about the situation context. All together there can be thousands of events per second. Today's approaches to monitoring networks are typically centralized, sending events over the network to a single engine for analysis. Centralized monitoring ultimately cannot scale to address the volume of events that one would ideally like to be able to monitor, so techniques of today often make severe compromises relating to the events that they ingest. Centralized monitoring creates a single point of failure and also generates significant network load. To overcome these deficiencies we have developed a more distributed, approach: our reasoner agents can (in theory) be installed on every monitored resources and the reasoner language (used for programming the reasoners) enables knowledge in a reasoner's working memory to be synchronized over multiple reasoners enabling them to implement parallel distributed reasoning algorithms that are able detect event patterns irrespective of whether the events are local or remote. Distributing the reasoning makes the system extremely resilient. Additionally, since the knowledge shared between the reasoning agents represents summary information, and because many on-line event correlation algorithms often suppress reporting once an incident has been reported, the amount of network load needed to support the distributed monitoring can actually be reduced. To demonstrate our approach we describe its application to the monitoring of a computing network that has been instrumented to protect it - - against 0-day email virus attacks.","2155-7578","978-1-4244-8178-1","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680347","autonomic response;distributed reasoning;event correlation;intelligent agents;network and security monitoring;parallel programs","Cognition;Correlation;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;computer viruses;electronic mail;inference mechanisms;parallel processing","Otto-Mate;computing networks;email virus attacks;operating system;parallel distributed reasoning algorithms;parallel distributed reasoning system;reasoner language;reasoning agents","","0","","11","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also heavy performances affect the control of storage. This paper demonstrates an efficient intrusion detection system model for network-attached storage based on system calls and improves the Process Homeostasis to realize the implementation.

In most cases, only a small part of the data which need to be processed is the abnormal data. The abnormal data will be overwhelmed by the normal data. A large number of normal data will occupy most of resources of the IDS and lead to a lot of false alarms. These all will bring troubles for Intrusion Response System and administrators. In this paper, we present a method based on semi-supervised learning to process the massive data in the high-speed network. We add some representative and labeled data to the large unlabeled dataset, and let them cluster. We regard the data which is most similar to the labeled data as normal data. It is suggested that the method can reduce the redundant data and false alarms efficiently, and also can improve the computation time.","","","","10.1049/cp.2010.0618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702956","false alarms;high-speed network;intrusion detection;semi-supervised learning","","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","high-speed network intrusion detection;highspeed network technology;intrusion detection system;intrusion response system and administrators;one data preprocessing method;redundant data;semisupervised learning;unlabeled dataset","","0","","","","","26-29 Sept. 2010","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200","Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy","Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security","Internet;computer network security;data privacy","DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure","","0","","56","","2015-02-10","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a new approach consists with merging of feature selection and classification for multiple class NSL-KDD cup 99 intrusion detection dataset employing support vector machine (SVM). The objective is to improve the competence of intrusion classification with a significantly reduced set of input features from the training data. In supervised learning, feature selection is the process of selecting the important input training features and removing the irrelevant input training features, with the objective of obtaining a feature subset that produces higher classification accuracy. In the experiment, we have applied SVM classifier on several input feature subsets of training dataset of NSL-KDD cup 99 dataset. The experimental results obtained showed the proposed method successfully bring 91% classification accuracy using only three features and 99% classification accuracy using 36 features, while all 41 training features achieved 99% classification accuracy.","","","","10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083539","NSL KDD Cup 99 dataset;classification;feature selection;intrusion detection;support vector machines","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Testing;Training;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","NSL-KDD cup 99 dataset;SVM classifier;feature selection;information security policy;intrusion classification;intrusion detection;supervised learning;support vector machine","","0","","17","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
