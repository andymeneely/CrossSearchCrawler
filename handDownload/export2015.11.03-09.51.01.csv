These networks are most popular in industry now days. WiMax is used for MAN and Wi-Fi is used for LAN. WiMax standard provides point to multipoint broadband services up to 30 miles with the frequency ranges from 10 GHz to 60 GHz. This standard can deliver 75 Mbps per channel with end-to-end encryption called CCMP (which is Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) that is based on AES encryption. These measures are not enough in dense urban area especially if services are VoIP or multimedia based. So, Wi-Fi protocol IEEE 802.11 can solve this problem. Wi-Fi is a standard that covers 20 MHz per channel with 100-meter range. The future of next generation broadband network hides in these protocols.","","978-1-4244-8650-2","978-969-8741-07-5","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5596198","","","WiMax;cryptography;message authentication;wireless LAN","AES encryption;Wi-Fi;WiMax;broadband wireless access;cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol;counter mode;point to multipoint broadband services","","0","","11","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to monolithic intrusion detection system, we introduce autonomous agents, acting independently of each other, to monitor the system. The agents are deployed in virtual machines to analyze actions occurring on the network and inside the hosts to determine whether they are potential security violations or not.

A data-based analysis for major industries is performed, where we map the maximum potential loss of a firm with the optimal cybersecurity budget size and discover that the optimal budget size is independent of the mix of assets that a firm holds. In addition, we also conclude that firms in finance, energy, and technology sectors should invest more in detective technologies than preventive, as oppose to even split in most other industries.

They have access to home internal networks which allows an adversary to easily carry out man-in-the-middle attacks and spread infections wirelessly. They can also be used to launch massive denial of service attacks that target the physical infrastructure as well as the RF spectrum (both WiFi and cellular). While Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) vulnerabilities are common knowledge, the flaws of the WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) protocol are less known. In this paper, we use an epidemiological approach, combined with experimental war-driving measurements to investigate the speed of infections spreading in four neighborhoods of Boston, MA, USA, with distinct population and demographics. Our analysis and experimental data indicate that such attacks are feasible. While the graph of WEP APs and WPS APs may not be fully connected, the combined graph of WEP-WPS APs is fully connected, making large scale spreading of infections feasible. Due to the unique characteristics of WPS, the absence of automated firmware upgrades and mechanisms to safely configure and administer APs; these attacks pose a significant threat that require serious attention and countermeasures to provide safe management of APs and their policies.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682757","","Computational modeling;Educational institutions;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Protocols;Sociology;Statistics;Wireless communication","access protocols;cellular radio;computer network security;data privacy;firmware;wireless LAN","Boston;USA;WEP;WPS flaws;WPS protocol;WiFi AP infections;WiFi protected setup protocol;access points;automated firmware;cellular radio;denial of service attacks;epidemiological study;home internal networks;man-in-the-middle attacks;war-driving measurements;wired equivalent privacy","","0","","33","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though huge budget is spent in creating, maintaining and offering the courses through e-Learning, security is still not considered as an important aspect in e-Learning. This leads to unauthorized access to course content, thread of discussions and evaluation reports of the learners.

We use neural-fuzzy interface as our architecture detection engine. The ability of the proposed architecture has been evaluated using two introduced measures (PTDN and PFDN), and in overhead case it is compared with traditional standalone architecture.

This paper proposed an anomaly detection method using a simple Hide Markov Model to detect the abnormal network behaviors. We build a Hide Markov Model by supposing that all the network behaviors are completely normal.

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated through emulations in Mininet.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838227","","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Control systems;IP networks;Measurement;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","application program interfaces;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management","Floodlight;Mininet;OpenFlow standard;PayLess framework;RESTful API;SDN;adaptive statistics collection algorithm;aggregate statistics collection;application program interfaces;communication interfaces;control plane;data plane;flow control;flow level statistics collection mechanism;network management tasks;pull-based service;software defined networking;statistics collection mechanism","","14","","28","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: application layer IDS (AIDS), transport layer IDS (TIDS), network layer IDS (NIDS) and link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type. The experimental results indicate that each IDS type has different features set that can not only improve the overall performance of the IDS, but it also can improve its scalability.","","978-1-4244-3999-7","978-0-7695-3639-2","10.1109/WAINA.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136630","Intrusion detection systems;TCP/IP network model;features ranking;features selection;support vector decision function;support vector machines","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data processing;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Support vector machines;TCPIP","security of data;transport protocols","TCP/IP network layer;application layer;information security;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network allocation;network devices;transport layer","","1","","24","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The simple user interface in this design allows users update the component code of database access through easy operation. That can avoid service providers or software developers to easily get the user's privacy data.","","978-0-7695-3876-1","","10.1109/ICIII.2009.341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369822","privacy;separate data;software as a service;user data","Application software;Cryptography;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Industrial electronics;Protection;Software maintenance;Software safety","Web services;data privacy;user interfaces","data separation;software-as-a-service;user data privacy;user interface","","2","","8","","","26-27 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

None has focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time. Two dimensionality reduction techniques are used one linear technique (Principal Component Analysis) and one non-linear technique (Multidimensional Scaling).

Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to attacks as they are frequently deployed in open and unattended environments. In this paper, we describe the wormhole attack, a severe routing attack against sensor networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. We detail its characteristics and study its effects on the successful operation of a sensor network. We present state-of-the-art research for addressing wormhole related problems in wireless sensor networks and discuss the relative strengths and shortcomings of the proposed solutions. To date, most of the proposed defenses focus on preventive mechanisms that can be applied to protect sensor networks from this kind of attacks. However, no work has been published regarding the possibility of using more sophisticated methods, like intrusion detection systems, to achieve a more complete and autonomic defense mechanism against wormhole attackers. We present our work on intrusion detection and introduce a lightweight IDS framework, called LIDeA, designed for wireless sensor networks. LIDeA is based on a distributed architecture, in which nodes overhear their neighboring nodes and collaborate with each other in order to successfully detect an intrusion. We conclude by highlighting how such a system can be used for defending against wormhole attackers.","","978-1-4244-4066-5","978-1-4244-4067-2","10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5172466","","Collaborative work;Communication system security;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Protection;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","autonomous sensor device;distributed architecture;intrusion detection system;pervasive interconnection;wireless sensor network;wormhole attack","","1","","21","","","17-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is critical to develop methods to study the interaction between the attacker and defender for finding the optimal allocation of the limited defense resources. In this study, the LR attack considering the attack and defense is modeled by bilevel optimization. Game-theoretic approaches are developed to model the interaction of the attacker and defender for two scenarios for defending critical measurements and for defending critical substations. The attack and defense interaction is modeled by a zero-sum game if only the load curtailment is considered in the utility functions. And it can be modeled by a non-zero-sum game if both the load curtailment and the associated attack cost and defense cost are considered. The proposed approach is tested based on a representative IEEE 14-bus system, and optimal defense strategies are derived in different scenarios.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably “Attack multipliers” and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naïve fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681","978-1-4673-5956-6","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","3","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the use of SDN as an approach to assist in the modernization of SCADA systems. We discuss its possible benefits, such as simplified management of power system resources. Moreover, SDN can facilitate the creation of new network applications that previously, with traditional networks, were more complex to be implemented. To illustrate the benefits of the use of SDN in SCADA, we designed a mechanism that aims to prevent a possible eavesdropper from fully capturing communication flows between SCADA components. The mechanism was implemented as an SDN-based application for SCADA systems that uses multipath routing, which relies on SDN features to frequently modify communication routes between SCADA devices. Further, we performed an experimental evaluation to verify the impact and performance of the mechanism in the SCADA network.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140289","","Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Routing;SCADA systems;Substations","SCADA systems;power system management;smart power grids;software defined networking;substations;telecommunication network routing","ICT;SCADA components;SCADA devices;SCADA network performance;SDN-based SCADA systems;communication flows;communication routes;electric system;electricity distribution;electricity transmission;field devices;information and communication technology;multipath routing;network applications;power grids;power system resources management;smart grids;software-defined networking;substations management;substations monitoring;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","31","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.","0730-3157","978-1-4244-7512-4","978-0-7695-4085-6","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339","autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability","SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability","","0","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, log files' analysis can be valuable to system and security administrators if the difficulty of extracting the relevant information of the different kinds of data and formats can be surmounted. And if we consider a huge system in terms of users, services and accesses, the difficulty of the analysis task rises enormously. In infra-structures where there is more than one server and communication link, it is possible for the administrator and security team to configure all systems to record their logs in a central huge repository, but the search for abnormalities is quite impossible without specialized tools. As we believe that the collected information on log files can be valuable, we use information retrieval open source tools to index the log files' fields and search for patterns of suspected behavior, which may indicate a system intrusion. Our development allows queries based on variables introduced by the analyst. The preliminary results obtained when using log files from an academic institution indicates that our approach is effective and can be used as a security aid.","","978-1-4577-1487-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5974290","data mining;information retrieval;log;security","Colon;Documentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Java;Security","security of data","academic institution;information retrieval open source tools;log file analysis;security aid;security related events;suspected behavior patterns;system intrusion","","0","","9","","","15-18 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the surface, this should greatly reduce the chances of successfully executing the type of coordinated and distributed cyber attacks necessary to cause large-scale failures. However, existing communications security schemes in power control systems only consider explicit communications. In this paper, we show that there is a rich set of covert communication channels available to attackers for use in coordinating large scale attacks against power grids. Specifically, we present PhyCo, a novel covert channel that leverages physical substrates, e.g., line loads, within a power system, to transmit information between compromised device controllers. Using PhyCo, two compromised controllers that are miles apart can coordinate their efforts by manipulating relays to modify the power network's topology. This can be done without requiring the use of any explicit communication channels, e.g., power line communications, and can evade intrusion detection sensors aimed at overt traffic. We have evaluated PhyCo using real-world programmable logic controllers on a realistic simulated power grid. Our results show that PhyCo can bypass existing intrusion detection sensors as well as physical inspections by carefully crafting covert communications to have minimal exterior consequences within normal operating thresholds.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007771","","Equations;Mathematical model;Power grids;Power measurement;Receivers;Sensors","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;programmable controllers","PhyCo;coordinated cyber attacks;covert channel communication;cyberphysical infrastructures;device controller;distributed cyber attacks;electric power systems;physical interdependencies;power grid;power network topology;programmable logic controller","","0","","24","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces.

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system. The experimental results demonstrate a high detection rate of 97.4% and a very low false positive rate of 2.5%.

It is considered as a major deficiency while handling heterogeneous and nonstationary data stream to uncover anomaly in the online operational mode. This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently. Moreover, constructed connections are very adequate for training and evaluating IDS models.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750267","data aggregation;intrusion detection;performance monitoring;real-time systems","Correlation;Cryptography;Measurement;Receivers;Silicon","data handling;security of data","DARPA dump data flow;IDS;data stream handling;dynamic window size;heterogeneous data stream;intrusion detection systems;massive data flow conversion;network security;nonstationary data stream;queuing concept;simulated network;time slot windows;university campus","","0","","33","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They typically use obfuscation techniques, such as encryption and covert channels, to hide their command-and-control traffic and avoid detection. In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor).

They are usually deployed in unattended and harsh environments that make them susceptible for many kinds of attacks. Different security mechanisms have been proposed for WSN. Detection-based mechanisms are considered to be the second defense line against attacks when the traditional prevention based mechanisms failed to detect them. Different intrusion detection schemes have been introduced (e.g. rule based, statistical based...etc). Rule-based intrusion detection schemes are considered to be the fast and simple schemes that are suitable for the demand of WSN. However, these schemes are more specific to some kinds of attacks and cannot be generalized. In addition, these schemes cannot detect the unknown attacks that are not included in their rule base. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art rule based intrusion detection schemes and then introduce a novel framework based on rule based scheme that is able to overcome these limitations.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122778","Intrusion Detection;Rule Learning;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Collaboration;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks","knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","intrusion detection framework;rule learning;rule-based intrusion detection scheme;security issue;wireless sensor network","","1","","12","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to tackle this problem a novel idea of using Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) supported by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is proposed. The working model recommends a Trigger (passive PIRs) based video motes sensors installed at various concealed points, ubiquitously deployed in and around the maternity or nursery ward; while new born babies are tagged with RFID heel-bands. This paper principally covers the WSN aspect of the project and only gives functioning concepts of the RFID portion. The Zigbee transceiver selected for the solution was ATMEL's ATZB-A24-UFL with the controller, ATmega164p. The WSN ad-hoc network is based on a mesh topology allowing for hoping of data between motes extending the communication radius. The video provides an effective and energy efficient way of transmitting jpegs at 4fps passive and 1 frame per 12 second for active monitoring. The nodes are extremely cost efficient especially compared to Commercial of the Self (COTS) surveillance cameras and far smaller in size. A customized application is also developed, to monitor and provide Social Network Forensics (SNF) as a forensic tool for post incident analysis.

Its design rationale is that web bots behave intrinsically differently from human beings, allowing them to be detected. This paper escalates the battle against web bots by exploring the limits of current HOP-based bot detection systems. We develop an evasive web bot system based on human behavioral patterns. Then we prototype a general web bot framework and a set of flexible de-classifier plugins, primarily based on application-level event evasion. We further abstract and define a set of benchmarks for measuring our system's evasion performance on contemporary web applications, including social network sites.

"Event Correlation for Intrusion Detection Systems","Dwivedi, N.; Tripathi, A.","","Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), 2015 IEEE International Conference on","20150402","2015","","","133","139","Intrusion Detection System (IDS) have grown into a mature and feature rich technology that provides advanced features to detect intrusion and provide responses. It also allows the management system for security analysis by monitoring, configuring and analyzing the intrusion data. A better understanding of alerts by using a general framework and infrastructure for detecting intrusions through event correlation strategy minimizes the amount of data generated. Event correlation techniques are needed for two reasons. First, network attack detection is usually based on information or data received from distributed sensors, e.g. intrusion detection systems. During attacks, the generated amount of events is hard to handle and so it is difficult to evaluate the current attack situation for a larger network. Thus, the concept of event or alert correlation has been introduced. Event correlation paints a picture of what is now being called as network or cyber situational awareness and tries to guide the security administrator on the actions that he can take to mitigate the crisis. The aim of the event correlation for intrusion detection system (IDS) is to improve security by correlating events and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. This correlation has been achieved by getting together similar alerts, thus allowing the analyst to only look at a few alerts instead of hundreds or thousands of alerts. In this paper, we correlate the results of SNORT Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with SEC (Simple Event Correlator) by taking the input from the MIT DARPA (Defense advanced Research Projects Agency) dataset. The alerts generated from Snort are very large and so it is difficult for the administrators to identify them. Here we correlate the alerts based on same name coming from different IP address. This correlation removes the duplication of alerts and thus reduces the information overload on the administrator.","","978-1-4799-6022-4","","10.1109/CICT.2015.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078682","Correlation;DARPA;IDS;SEC;events","Computers;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors","IP networks;computer network security;correlation methods","Defense advanced Research Projects Agency;IDS;IP address;MIT DARPA dataset;SEC;SNORT intrusion detection system;alert correlation;cyber situational awareness;distributed sensors;event correlation strategy;management system;network attack detection;security administrator;security analysis;simple event correlator;workload reduction","","0","","22","","","13-14 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack. Furthermore, the approach includes reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160207","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Base stations;Computer science;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Watermarking;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SFD;WSN;data transmission;security attacks;selective forwarding detection;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The defining characteristic of botnets is the use of command and control channels through which they can be updated and directed. Recently, botnet detection has been an interesting research topic related to cyber-threat and cyber-crime prevention. This paper is a survey of botnet and botnet detection. The survey clarifies botnet phenomenon and discusses botnet detection techniques. This survey classifies botnet detection techniques into four classes: signature-based, anomaly-based, DNS-based, and mining-base. It summarizes botnet detection techniques in each class and provides a brief comparison of botnet detection techniques.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5210988","Botnet;Botnet Detection;Cyber-security","Automatic control;Command and control systems;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Distributed computing;Information security;National security;Protocols;Robotics and automation","digital signatures;invasive software","botnet detection techniques;cyber-crime prevention;cyber-security;distributed denial of service attack;distributed platform;malware dissemination","","23","","34","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In mobile ad-hoc networks, data transmission is performed within an untrusted wireless environment. The lack of centralized infrastructure in ad-hoc network makes it vulnerable to various attacks. Wormhole attack is one of the most severe attacks with mobile ad-hoc networks. In wormhole attack, a malicious node records data packets at one location in the network and tunnels them to another malicious node far away, which retransmits them into the network locally. Some of the researchers have proposed many solutions for wormhole attack. In this paper an efficient method to detect a wormhole attack called modified wormhole detection AODV protocol has been proposed. Detection of wormhole attack is performed using number of hops in different paths from source to destination and delay of each node in different paths from source to destination. The destination is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. The performance of modified wormhole detection AODV protocol is justified by simulations.","","978-1-4799-0190-6","","10.1109/IC3.2013.6612197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612197","Ad-hoc networks;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole attack","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MAODV;centralized infrastructure;data packets;data transmission;malicious node;mobile ad-hoc networks;wireless mobile hosts;wormhole attack;wormhole detection AODV protocol","","0","","12","","","8-10 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing research carried out provides authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion detection in ad hoc networks. Ad hoc network characteristics should be taken into consideration to design efficient data security along its path of transmission. The proposal of this work presented a Data Security Architecture (DSA) in improving the data transmission confidentiality in ad hoc networks based on multi-path routing. It utilizes the multiple paths between nodes in an ad hoc network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data. The original message to be secured is split into parts that are transmitted in multiple paths. The parted messages are encrypted on its course of transmission which improves the security to next level. Experimental simulations are conducted to the proposed DSA approach and compared with existing ad hoc multi-path security solutions, which show DSA perform better than existing security solution up to 6% to 8% improvement.","","978-1-61284-807-5","","10.1109/NCOIET.2011.5738821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738821","Data Security Architecture(DSA);Mobile ad hoc networks;security","Data security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;radio networks;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;multipath encrypted data security architecture;multipath routing;secure routing;wireless network","","0","","15","","","17-18 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers.

In this method, the interactions between the attacker and the administrator are modeled as a non-cooperative zero-sum multistage game and it is modeled as a minmax game tree where the attacker is the leader and the administrator is the follower. Alternating the actions between the administrator and the attacker forms the game tree, each of them will be allowed to play a single action at any given time.

Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed. Finally, we provide the details of our FPGA implementation of the bioinformatics-based string matching technique. The associative string processor (ASP) is an associative memory-based micro-architecture with long fixed-length words that can be partially searched. We show that the proposed micro-architecture can handle fixed-length patterns at a rate of more than one character per cycle.","","978-1-4244-7716-6","","10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5586949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5586949","CAM;DNA computing;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection;anomaly identification;bioinformatics;pattern matching","Artificial neural networks;DNA","biocomputing;computer network security;content-addressable storage;field programmable gate arrays;string matching","DNA based anomaly identification system;DNA pattern matching;DNA sequence;FPGA implementation;anomaly intrusion detection system;associative memory based microarchitecture;associative string processor;bioinformatics;genetic material;network traffic patterns;string matching","","0","","15","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks do not use any predefined infrastructure during the communication so that all the present mobile nodes which are want to communicate with each other immediately form the topology and initiates the request for data packets to send or receive. In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s). This paper developed an anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system to detect the packet dropping attack from mobile ad hoc networks and this proposed solution also save the resources of mobile nodes in respect to remove the malicious nodes. For implementation point of view, qualnet simulator 6.1 and sugeno-type fuzzy inference system are used to make the fuzzy rule base for analyzing the results. From the simulation results it's proved that proposed system is more capable to detect the packet dropping attack with high positive rate and low false positive under each level (low, medium and high) of speed of mobile nodes.","","978-1-4799-2571-1","","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779330","MANETs security issues;detection methods;fuzzy logic;intrusion detection system (IDS);mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);packet dropping attack","Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes","fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system;data packets;fuzzy rule base;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;network topology;packet dropping attack;qualnet simulator 6.1;sugeno-type fuzzy inference system;wireless communication","","0","","16","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is difficult to develop software with conventional fixed algorithms (hard-wired logic on decision making level) for effectively defending against the dynamically evolving attacks in networks. This situation can be handled by applying methods of artificial intelligence that provide flexibility and learning capability to software. This paper presents a brief survey of artificial intelligence applications in cyber defense (CD), and analyzes the prospects of enhancing the cyber defense capabilities by means of increasing the intelligence of the defense systems. After surveying the papers available about artificial intelligence applications in CD, we can conclude that useful applications already exist. They belong, first of all, to applications of artificial neural nets in perimeter defense and some other CD areas. From the other side - it has become obvious that many CD problems can be solved successfully only when methods of artificial intelligence are being used. For example, wide knowledge usage is necessary in decision making, and intelligent decision support is one of yet unsolved problems in CD.","","978-1-61284-245-5","978-9949-9040-3-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954703","applied artificial intelligence;expert systems in cyber defense;intelligent cyber defense methods;neural nets in cyber defense","Computers;Expert systems;Learning systems;Neural networks;Software","computer network security;data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","artificial intelligence;artificial neural nets;automation;cyber defense;decision making;intelligent decision support;learning capability;network attacks;software development","","2","","43","","","7-10 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas. The defenders can use the knowledge of such correlation between attack location and its impact to set higher security levels at particular positions by monitoring sensitive network parameters and detecting the anomalies.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2266399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525333","RPL;Rank attack;internal threat;performance;security","","Internet of Things;computer network security;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN routing protocol;Internet of Things;QoS parameters;RPL;ad hoc routing protocols;communication standard;control messages;control overhead;device management;energy saving performance;high forwarding load area;lossy networks;low-power networks;quality of service;rank concept;routing protocol network topology;security levels;wireless sensor network","","2","","7","","2013-06-06","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we dissect the behavior of a few household devices, specifically the Phillips Hue light-bulb, the Belkin WeMo power switch, and the Nest smoke-alarm, and highlight the ease with which security and privacy can be compromised. We then propose a new solution to protect such devices by restricting access at the network-level. Our solution does not require changes from device manufacturers, reduces burden on the end-users, and allows security to be offered as an overlay service by the ISP or from a specialist provider in the cloud.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997469","","Authentication;Bridges;Privacy;Protocols;Sensors;Servers","alarm systems;authorisation;data privacy;domestic appliances;home computing;mobile computing","Belkin WeMo power switch;Nest smoke-alarm;Phillips Hue light-bulb;privacy risk;security risk;smart household appliance","","0","","16","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
