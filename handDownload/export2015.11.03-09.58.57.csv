To enable accurate and efficient cyber incident mission impact assessment, a Camus ontology that defines entities, relationships and attributes (ERAs) associated with them has been drafted. Methods for fusing data from multiple data sources have been developed alongside an ontology-based system to populate the model using existing network data sources. The Camus system demonstrates how commonly available data sources can be rapidly collected, correlated, and fused to automatically map cyber assets to the users who depend on them, to the missions they support, and to the services they provide. Also discussed are the technical architecture and challenges to such an approach.","","978-1-4244-5238-5","978-1-4244-5239-2","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380096","","Asset management;Context modeling;File servers;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Manuals;Mathematical model;Ontologies;Semantic Web","military computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);sensor fusion","automated mapping of cyber assets to missions and users;camus ontology;cyber incident mission impact assessment;cyber situation management;data fusion methods;multiple data sources;network data sources;ontology based system;technical architecture","","4","","19","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By modeling an existing network in the form of an “as-is” architecture, we can create a simulation model, which when stimulated with appropriate traffic, can be an executable architecture. The DOD Architecture Framework (DODAF) prescribes a modeling framework to capture high-level system design and operational requirements. The system attributes from a DODAF-compliant architecture can directly load a network simulator (Hamilton 2006). The use of network simulation to study denial of service attacks is well known. However, modeling and simulation techniques can be used to evaluate intrusion detection systems, place and configure security appliances and to design appropriate access control mechanisms.

Presently, MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre) disseminates the weather forecast information through web. Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform. It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest. While developing a client-server application, the communication between client and database server becomes imperative. This paper discusses detailed analysis for choosing appropriate type of web service, data exchange protocols, data exchange format, and Mobile positioning technologies for client-server application. It also highlights issues like memory capacity, security, poor response time, and battery consumption in mobile devices.

But the problem with anomaly based technique is that they give a lot of false alarms and very difficult to realize. Entropy is one of the anomaly detection technique used in intrusion detection. In this paper we are designing a system with the help of Entropy based technique and integrating with real time system Snort so that it can have advantages of both techniques.

The detection analysis which we perform is based on features extraction from network packets dumps and it employs a behavioral and statistical analysis of communications' progress in time and packet index domain. There were performed experiments in four scenarios simulating traffic shaping, traffic policing and transmission on unreliable network channel to make properties of direct attacks and obfuscated attacks as various as possible. Next part of this article is comparison of obfuscated and direct attacks classification by our previously designed ASNM network features with state-of-the-art features set of A.

This can be done by putting the network card on monitor mode, and filter the network frames based on the collected MAC addresses. Once any client is disconnected from the network, the attacker can spoof the client's MAC address and connect to the network.

The different probes of our collaborative detection system exchange anonymised information in order to synchronize the network analysis of the members of botnets and to identify the malicious servers controlling them. We evaluated our system using anonymised traffic captured on an operator's network, and the results showed an improvement of 31% of malicious servers detected resulting from the collaboration, and this without significant performance impact and bandwidth overhead (respectively 4% and 11kb/s).","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679994","Bloom filters;Botnet detection;Collaborative detection;Domain-flux botnets;Inter-domain detection","Collaboration;Communities;Monitoring;Privacy;Probes;Servers;Vectors","computer network security;data privacy;groupware;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","anonymised information exchange;anonymised traffic;business preservation;centralized approach;collaborative approach;collaborative detection system;interdomain botnet detection system;large-scale network real time analysis;malicious server identification;privacy preservation","","0","","27","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network functions virtualization together with software-defined networking can be used to efficiently coordinate different network security functionality in the network. To squeeze the best out of network capabilities, there is need for algorithms for optimal placement of the security functionality in the cloud infrastructure. However, due to the large number of flows to be considered and complexity of interactions in these networks, the classical placement algorithms are not scalable. To address this issue, we elaborate an optimization framework, namely OCDO, that provides adequate and scalable network security provisioning and deployment in the cloud. Our approach is based on an innovative multistage approach that combines together decomposition and segmentation techniques to the problem of security functions placement while coping with the complexity and the scalability of such an optimization problem.

Performance evaluation of wireless sensor network requires realistic modeling of intrusion detection system since most of WSNs are application specific. In WSN, nodes have specific properties such as stable neighbors' information that helps in detection of anomalies in network. Nodes monitor their neighborhood and collaborate with cluster head to detect malicious behavior.

IDS are an effective way to detect different kinds of attacks in an interconnected network thereby securing the network. An effective Intrusion Detection System requires high accuracy and detection rate as well as low false alarm rate. This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble. A method for calculating the number of the cluster centroid and choosing the appropriate initial cluster centroid is proposed in this paper.

Previous hardware solutions usually mandate drastic change to internal processor architecture. More recent ones to minimize the change have proposed external devices for DIFT. However, these approaches intrinsically suffer from the high overhead to communicate with their external devices. Consequently, they either significantly lose performance, or inevitably make invasive modifications to the processor inside. Our solution also rely on external hardware for DIFT, but unlike theirs, ours exploits the core debug interface (CDI) to tackle the communication issue. CDI is provided in most commercial processors for debugging so that we were able to build our system simply by plugging our hardware to the processor via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor itself. Experiments show that our hardware efficiently performs DIFT mainly thanks to the support of CDI that helps us cut substantially down the communication costs.","","","","10.1145/2744769.2744830","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167263","Core Debug Interface;Dynamic Information Flow Tracking","Computer architecture;Cryptography;Engines;Hardware;Kernel;Registers;Runtime","computer debugging;microprocessor chips;software reliability","CDI;DIFT;core debug interface;dynamic information flow tracking;internal processor architecture","","0","","21","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, we may adapt for less accuracy in order to gain speed for both with and/or without parallel processing techniques. We also construct an adaptive learning algorithm to update the model.

The behavior based monitoring is used to avoid the polymorphic malicious code. Signature based detection system or fixing these vulnerabilities are not the efficient method. Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user. Next the scrambling is done with that legitimate user ID. The unscrambling is done to get the original dispatch ID only if it is a legitimate user. It introduces an average eight percent computation overhead into the system.","","978-1-4673-2756-5","","10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450586","Malicious code;Native API;Scrambling","Browsers;Computers;Educational institutions;Kernel;Monitoring;Registers","application program interfaces;security of data","behavior based monitoring;high level system API;kernel mode;local ID;malicious code prevention;polymorphic malicious code;remote ID;security scheme;signature based detection system;system service caller;window system","","0","","11","","","21-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link. Thus lot of well behaved node may be avoided by network which results in losing of well behaved routes. To eliminate the requirement of predistributed keys proposed system considers Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm.","","978-1-4799-2321-2","","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892733","Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm;EAACK;IDS;MANET","Classification algorithms;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Random access memory;Routing","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm;EAACK;IDS Watchdog;MANET;MRA;S-ACK;acknowledgement packets;ambiguous collisions;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;misbehavior report authentication;mobile ad hoc network;mobile nodes;node misbehavior detection;one-hop ACK;receiver collisions;routing protocol;secure ACK;wireless links","","1","","9","","","13-14 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We hence propose charactering attacks as partially ordered sets, and we show how these can be detected asynchronously, as will typically be the case in a modern computing architecture. By extending a naïve model incorporating subsets of known causal dependencies, enhanced observation strategies minimizing the number and cost of observations can be derived. This incorporation of knowledge regarding constraints on attack causality into observations allows for notable enhancements in the efficiency of detection.

The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack.

Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection.

They have a complementary effect to avoid missing some attacks. The ultimate trait of our proposed framework is that it is flexible enough for users to do some changes and improvements. Users just need to take surprisingly little effort to customize the framework to fit for their needs. We have designed an experiment to test the framework's ability to protect the simulated Web application against the brute force attack. The experimental results show that our intelligent framework has good performance and is able to detect the brute force attack timely.","","978-1-4799-7283-8","","10.1109/ICEIEC.2015.7284478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284478","Brute Force Attack;Intelligent Framework;Intrusion Detection;ModSecurity;SuStorID","Authentication;Engines;Force;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Web servers","computer network security;data protection;learning (artificial intelligence)","Internet company;Web application protection;anomaly-based method;auditing;brute force attack;customer confidentiality;intelligent framework;machine learning;network intrusion detection;network intrusion detection system;network safe protection;network security;rule-based method","","","","","","","14-16 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design an intrusion detection mechanism for the VANETs using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Due to the enormous number of sensor nodes and the constrained resources, specific research challenges can be identified with respect to security. Almost all available commercial and research sensor nodes are equipped with ZigBee transceiver chips, and thus making ZigBee the de-facto standard in WSN communication. Since Joshua Wright's KillerBee Framework was released with its focus on exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee networks, non security-hardened WSNs increase the risk of being vulnerable against certain attacks such as simple association flooding and packet replay attacks. We propose an anomaly-based approach intrusion detection system (IDS) optimized for ZigBee-based WSN to protect ZigBee-based WSN nodes against KillerBee supported attacks. We describe the KillerBee attack procedure and propose an approach of guarding a ZigBee transceiver. Based on an extended sensor node/network simulation and analysis framework, we demonstrate furthermore how our anomaly-based detection engine can thwart attacks on a ZigBee transceiver.","","","","10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727840","","Cryptography;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Radiation detectors;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","Zigbee;computer network security;radio transceivers;wireless sensor networks","IDS;KillerBee framework;WSN communication;ZigBee transceiver chip;anomaly-based approach;anomaly-based detection engine;de-facto standard;intrusion detection system;network security;nonsecurity-hardened WSN;packet replay attack;sensor node-network simulation;thwart attack;wireless sensor network","","0","","17","","","14-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Patterns based detectors used in Packet Inspection implement multi-pattern matching algorithms to check whether the packet payload have a specified patterns in a patterns set. Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification. The final decision is made on the integrated low-faceted character space. Finally, the proposed two-level system is evaluated using DARPA 1999 IDS dataset for the detection of unauthorized packets.","","978-1-4673-1911-9","","10.1109/ICACC.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305551","Intrusion detection;Network Security;Packet inspection;Pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;inspection;pattern matching;statistical analysis","Internet;SeqDM;deep packet inspection;firewalls;high-faceted character space;integrated low-faceted character space;intrusion detection systems;multipattern matching algorithms;network security;packet identification;pattern based detectors;sequential differentiate method;statistical pattern approach;two-level IDS;two-level packet inspection;unauthorized packet detection","","0","","22","","","9-11 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast Entropy shows the significant reduce of computational time compared to conventional entropy computation while it maintains detection accuracy. However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme. In addition, we found that Dynamic AFEA can enhance detection level more than fixed (non-dynamic) one when it is equipped with Fast Entropy.","","978-1-61284-733-7","978-0-7695-4372-7","10.1109/IMIS.2011.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976144","DDoS;Dynamic Adaptive Detector;Entropy based approach;Fast Infromatin Entropy","Accuracy;Computer crime;Detectors;Entropy;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring","Internet;entropy;security of data","Internet;adaptive DDoS attack detection using fast entropy approach;adaptive threshold shifting;distributed denial-of-service attacks;dynamic detection window size","","1","","11","","","June 30 2011-July 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a node wishes to communicate with other node in the network, it invites all available nodes to participate in the routing mechanism; moreover, conventional routing protocols assume trusted co-operative environment. As a result, network layer of MANET is prone to various security attacks and therefore, finding a secure and efficient route becomes a major challenge.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","4","","34","","2012-01-18","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation. By implementing intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies to spawn the reallocation process (a procedure called triggering), DARTS provides a flexible, lightweight, and scalable method to efficiently allow reconnaissance and other distributed sensing applications to occur on a mobile, airborne platform.","2155-7578","978-1-4244-8178-1","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5679552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679552","","Aircraft;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Sensors","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;security of data","ad hoc network;distributed agent;distributed apt resource transference system;distributed sensing method;fault tolerant distributed reconnaissance;flooding based resource discovery method;intrusion detection system;resource management;resource reallocation","","3","","16","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A core component of the smart grid is the advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs), which increase the attack surface due to smart devices deployed at households. Manual management of security incidents in such a large and complex system is impractical, and the need for automated response and recovery to attacks is critical. This paper addresses that challenge through two main contributions. First, we introduce and classify an extended set of AMI-specific cyber incident response actions. Second, we define a cost model and an approach to translate security properties into monetary costs. The cost model is a key element in enabling an automated response engine to make optimal decisions and mitigate cyber incidents.","","978-1-4673-0910-3","978-1-4673-0909-7","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486008","AMI;CPS;Cyber security;Response action","Availability;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Home appliances;Pricing;Security;Taxonomy","metering;power system management;power system security;smart power grids","AMI;AMI-specific cyber incident response actions;advanced metering infrastructures;automated response actions;cost modeling;monetary costs;security incident management;security property;security vulnerability;smart devices;smart grid","","4","","31","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes. With the proposed system, even if cryptographic keys are obtained by an attacker and are used to send false routing information or other spurious control information, the network will be able to identify such malicious nodes by using artificial intelligence and an expert system developed using the C Language Integrated Production System tool.","1091-0050","978-1-4799-0052-7","","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567421","","Computer crime;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","C language;artificial intelligence;cryptography;expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","C language integrated production system tool;CLIPS expert system tool;artificial intelligence;autonomous sensor nodes;base station;cryptographic key protection;data collection;denial-of-service attacks;energy constraints;environmental monitoring applications;false routing information;healthcare applications;home applications;limited processing power;malicious nodes;military applications;sensitive data protection;spurious control information;strong encryption approaches;tamper proof packaging;unwelcome sensor network;wireless sensor network security","","1","","20","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pre-deployment testing alone does not ensure complete security and hence post-deployment monitoring of web applications during its interaction with the external world can help us to handle SQL Injection Attacks in a better way. In this paper, we present a framework which can be used to handle tautology based SQL Injection Attacks using post-deployment monitoring technique. Our framework uses two pre-deployment testing techniques i.e. basis path and data flow testing techniques to identify legal execution paths of the software. Runtime monitors are then developed and integrated to observe the behavior of the software for identified execution paths such that their violation will help to detect and prevent tautology based SQL Injection Attacks.","","978-1-4673-1425-1","","10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246104","Data Flow Testing;Path Testing;Post-deployment Monitoring;Runtime Monitors;SQL Injection Attacks (SQLIAs);Tautology","Databases;Games;Monitoring;Runtime;Security;Software;Testing","Internet;SQL;data flow analysis;data integrity;safety-critical software","Web application availability;backend database;basis path techniques;data confidentiality;data flow testing technique;data integrity;legal execution path;post-deployment monitoring technique;predeployment testing technique;runtime monitors;stored information security;tautology based SQL injection attacks","","2","","21","","","26-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes in the network are fully dependent on other nodes so as to complete the communication successfully. In addition to this, nodes are moving freely and make dynamic topology. Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network. To facilitate such issue trust is a prominent factor to defend against security issues in MANET. Our aim in this review is to present schemes which are mainly focused on trust based security for MANET and also discuss the needs and properties of trust and discuss the attacks that mainly affect the security and also discussed the traditional proposed security solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICICA.2014.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965058","Authentication;MANET;Security;Trust","Authentication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad hoc networks;trust based security schemes","","0","","35","","","6-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of multiple techniques is the subject of research for deriving security requirements. In this paper, we are overlapping misuse case and attack trees techniques to propose a new technique named ""Hybrid Technique"". This Hybrid Technique merges the strengths of misuse cases and attack trees making the system stronger to mitigate weaknesses effectively in large and complex systems.

Traditional layout methods create the network graph with overwhelming visual clutter, which hinders the network understanding and traffic analysis tasks. The existing graph simplification algorithms (e.g. community-based clustering) can effectively reduce the visual complexity, but lead to less meaningful traffic representations. In this paper, we introduce a new method to the traffic monitoring and anomaly analysis of large networks, namely Structural Equivalence Grouping (SEG). Based on the intrinsic nature of the computer network traffic, SEG condenses the graph by more than 20 times while preserving the critical connectivity information. Computationally, SEG has a linear time complexity and supports undirected, directed and weighted traffic graphs up to a million nodes.

The principle is to coordinate the results from each single-engine intrusion alert system, by seamlessly integrating with the multiple layered distributed service-oriented structure. An improved hidden Markov model (HMM) is created for the detection engine which is capable of the immunology-based self/nonself discrimination. The classifications of normal and abnormal behaviour of system calls are further examined by an advanced fuzzy-based inference process called HPSOWM. Considering a real benchmark dataset from the public domain, our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can greatly shorten the training time of HMM and reduce the false positive rate significantly.

While these needs are traditionally provided through methods of channel encryption and signing, such mechanisms are often difficult or impossible to implement in the ad-hoc, decentralized environments seen in sensor networks, collaborative intrusion detection systems, or other similar peer-to-peer networks. Using the concepts from one-way hashing and language-derived relevance theory, we propose five novel contributions relevant to ad-hoc communications and security: one-way cryptographic hashing as a mechanism for securely communicating in an environment where preexisting shared knowledge exists, hashed shared knowledge messages as a basis for secure formation of self-selecting subgroups and trust building, adding salt to the shared knowledge hashes to remove the static nature of common messages and defend against precomputed table attacks, integration of variable complexity hash functions to dynamically adjust hash complexity relative to message complexity, and a message integrity element based on the secrecy of the original shared knowledge within a hashed message. Although our proposed mechanisms are likely implemented without difficulty from a network and encryption standpoint, they do require significant integration and awareness within the applications relying on them. The method also assumes a static value from a large existing set of shared knowledge, which does not always exist.","","978-1-4577-0980-7","978-0-7695-4459-5","10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032224","hashing;secure communications;shared knowledge","Ad hoc networks;Complexity theory;Encryption;Knowledge engineering;Receivers","ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","ad-hoc communication;ad-hoc environment;ad-hoc security;channel encryption;channel signing;collaborative intrusion detection system;complexity hash function;decentralized communication network;language-derived relevance theory;message complexity;message confidentiality;message integrity;message-based communication network;one-way cryptographic hashing mechanism;one-way hashing;peer-to-peer network;salted hash;secure communication;sensor network","","1","","29","","","18-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is being widely used in critical infrastructure for monitoring and controlling the activities. The collaborative environment and interconnectivity of SCADA system needs communications and transmission of sensed real time data like status of machines, breaks and leakages in the system across various devices in the industrial plant. Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture. This work also considers the constraints of the SCADA system thereby providing an elegant identification of malicious activities for the current SCADA system.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726619","Aggregation;ICS-Industrial control system;Log Management;SCADA;attack","Computer architecture;Jamming;Magnetic heads;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Sensors","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;industrial control;industrial plants;production engineering computing;security of data;system monitoring","Log analysis approach;SCADA systems;cluster based architecture;cooperative monitoring;critical infrastructure;cyber attacks;human machine interface;industrial automation;industrial plant;malicious activity detection;malicious activity identification;node level;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","1","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","1","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security is one of the biggest problems for all information technologies and also in cloud computing. Some mechanisms are used such as antivirus software, firewall, guard systems or intrusion detection/prevention systems to increase the system security. The main handicap of these mechanisms is extensive usage of hardware, especially CPU and memory. In this paper, we examine the hardware usage of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) with different network architectures. Although the virtualization is preferred by the most of the providers, we chose a virtualized environment as our test bed because of its easier implementation structure from other cloud technologies such as grid and blade architectures. We focused on a proxy NIDS architecture, which is a gateway-based approach (intrusion detection assignment carried out by an outer entity, so why we called it proxy) and has less hardware requirements than other positioning options. It is aimed to show an effective location to IDSs in a virtualized environment. As a result, both providers and customers can easily decide where to locate their defense mechanism.","","978-1-4673-5612-1","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557203","cloud computing;intrusion detection;proxy NIDS;security","Databases;Hardware;Instruction sets;Linux;Logic gates;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtualisation","NIDS architecture;antivirus software;blade architecture;cloud computing paradigm;cloud technologies;conventional data centers;defense mechanism;firewall;gateway-based approach;grid architecture;guard systems;hardware usage;information technologies;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network architectures;proxy network intrusion detection system;system security;virtualization;virtualized environment","","4","","27","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the common belief that IDS should be executed as often as possible to cope with insider attacks to prolong the system lifetime, we discover that IDS should be executed at an optimal rate to maximize the mean time to failure of the system. Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used. We develop mathematical models based on Stochastic Petri nets to identify the optimal rate for IDS execution to maximize the mean time to failure of the system, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational conditions, and attacker behaviors.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2010.2040534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5409536","Intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;mean time to security failure;mission-oriented group communication systems;mobile ad hoc networks","","Petri nets;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system techniques;mathematical models;mission execution;mission-oriented mobile group systems reliability;mobile ad hoc networks;stochastic Petri nets","","10","","31","","2010-02-08","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This work presented in this paper proposes a new temporal data mining analysis technique of intrusion detection systems based on naïve Bayes networks. The presented system considered the time dimension and built many different classifier models to obtain an accurate analysis of intruders. The obtained results give more focusing and deep understanding of the intruders' behavior during the different time periods and illustrate the shrinking and expansions of intruders' classes over the time slices (the migrations of intruders from one segment to another), The temporal analysis of intruders can help in taking an appropriate decision against specific type of attacks (decisions must be suitable with the intruder behaviour).

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the efficacies of intrusion aggregations to succinctly process audit logs that are gaining wider acceptability in computer security are flawed because the methods frequently require high level of expertise to validate each alert and the methods only focus on interesting events. Thus, deceptive attacks that are intentionally launched to be uninteresting events frequently elude detections. Consequently, aggregated alerts are not seriously considered for litigation and incident handling exercises. Therefore, this paper presents extensive investigations of these problems. We deployed Snort to sniff offline datasets in intrusion detection mode and we clustered the alerts of each dataset with several filtering criteria. Furthermore, the results obtained have established how to detect various kinds of interesting and uninteresting attacks that frequently elude detections.","","978-1-4244-5984-1","","10.1109/ISMS.2010.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416066","Alerts;aggregation;interesting alerts;uninteresting alerts","Analytical models;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Event detection;Filtering;Forensics;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection","computer forensics;computer network security;pattern clustering","Snort;alert clustering;deceptive attacks;filtering criteria;incident handling exercise;incident reporting;litigation exercise;log analyzer;network auditing;network forensics;network intrusion detection system;security violation","","0","","25","","","27-29 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its limitation of finding novel attacks, we propose a hybrid model based on improved fuzzy and data mining techniques, which can detect both misuse and anomaly attacks. The aim of our research is to reduce the amount of data retained for processing i.e., attribute selection process and also to improve the detection rate of the existing IDS using data mining technique. We then use improved Kuok fuzzy data mining algorithm, which in turn a modified version of APRIORI algorithm, for implementing fuzzy rules, which allows us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks. We applied fuzzy inference engine using mamdani inference mechanism with three variable inputs for faster decision making.

As the traditional network security situation awareness methods mainly forecast the situation value based on mathematical models, which will result in the ignorance of the dynamic changes of network security situation elements, this paper presents a method of network security situation awareness based on network simulation. This method firstly constructs various simulation elements models; secondly it constructs a network security situation awareness simulation scenario based on these constructed models; thirdly it uses abstract packet-forwarding method to quickly infer network security behaviors in simulation scenario meanwhile recording important log information; finally it evaluates the value of network security situation based on the log information and forecasts the network security situation. Experiment proves that this method can reduce the network security stimulation time effectively and evaluate the network security situation value accurately.","","","","10.1109/IWECA.2014.6845671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6845671","abstract packet-forwarding;network security situation;network simulation;situation awareness","Databases;Security;Servers","computer network security","log information;mathematical models;network security behaviors;network security situation awareness method;network security situation elements;network simulation;packet-forwarding method","","0","","8","","","8-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood are within radio range of each other. Such a neighborhood of nodes is known as a clique. The technique uses message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes. The proposed intrusion detection system is independent of any routing protocol.","","978-1-4244-7769-2","","10.1109/ICCCCT.2010.5670735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5670735","Clique;Intrusion detection system (IDS);MANETs;Malicious node;Security","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Monitoring","message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET;clique;intrusion detection system;malicious node detection;message passing;mobile ad-hoc networks","","3","","13","","","7-9 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The arrival of advanced wireless communication device leads to demand in the spectrum and the need to improve utilization of vacant spectrum. In the past decade the spectrum sensing and allocation has been the main focus of research than security in cognitive radio. A selfish cognitive radio node is a serious security issue which occupies a part or full resources (pre-occupation problem) in the multiple channel, and forbids other legitimate cognitive nodes from consuming the resources. This self-centered cognitive radio can critically degrade the performance of the network; so a skillful resource allocation strategy should adopted in order to avoid these selfish attacks in the network. The conventional resource allocation approaches in cognitive network are fully dependent. In this scheme, a coalition game theory used to avoid these selfish attacks with multiple PU's and multiple SU's. The proposed approaches consist of multiple PU's and SU's gathered on a set, in which PU allows the other SU's to make use of its resources in contract or agreement on a timely basis. The PU makes decision to select the optimal SU based on their channel status and the SU act as a relay to PU and help the PU in their transmission of data. This scheme adopts efficient resource allocation in a multichannel cooperative manner due to emerging of many cooperative communication devices. This proposed system follows the core concept and also support shapley value to equally distribute the payoff throughout the users in the network. By this resource allocation approach, the selfish attacks can be prevented in the system and thereby increase the resource utilization efficiency in the network","","978-1-78561-030-1","","10.1049/ic.2013.0363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119750","CRAHN;Shapley value;coalitional game theory;cognitive radio;core;selfish attacks","","ad hoc networks;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;signal detection;telecommunication security","CR;Shapley value;advanced wireless communication device;coalition game theory based resource allocation strategy;cognitive radio ad-hoc networks;cooperative communication devices;intelligent radio;multiple PU;multiple SU;resource utilization efficiency;self-centered cognitive radio;selfish attack avoidance;selfish cognitive radio node;spectrum holes;spectrum sensing","","0","","","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Considering the characteristics of multi-source information, complicated data structure in the network security research, this paper puts forward a multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, which is based on improved Analytic Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (AHP_FCE), for network security situational assessment. In this method, the hierarchical network index system which consists of three layers, namely, index layer, criterion layer and target layer from bottom to top, is established. The data of the index layer processed by the fuzzy mathematics is obtained from the massive snort alarm information and vulnerability information. The evaluation index weights each layer are calculated by the improved AHP. Comprehensive evaluation is started from the index layer, and by using the evaluation index weights, the factors of security situational are obtained in the criterion layer; by calculating layer by layer upwards, the hosts' security situational values are obtained in the target layer. Finally, the network security situational value is obtained using the hosts' weights. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated using DARPA 2000 data sets.","","978-1-4673-6341-9","","10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748501","","Buffer overflows;Data models;Feature extraction;Ice;Security","computer network security;fuzzy systems","analytic hierarchy process;fuzzy mathematics;massive snort alarm information;multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model;network security;situational assessment model;vulnerability information","","0","","15","","","19-21 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
