One compelling example, proposed in this paper, is the case of whitelists for DDoS mitigation, where domains broadcast, for each possible DDoS target (!), the set of legitimate customers (client IP addresses) whose traffic should not be blocked while a DDoS attack is in progress. However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers. In a previous work, we proposed a cryptographic approach called “conditional data sharing”, devised to permit disclosure of cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets of network monitoring data, only when a threshold number of domains are ready to reveal their data. In this paper, we cast such technique to a realistic scenario of whitelist sharing for DDoS mitigation, and we significantly extend the underlying cryptographic approach so as to support disclosure not only for threshold-based policies, but for more general (monotone) access structures.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824986","","Access control;Computer crime;Conferences;Cryptography;IP networks;Monitoring","computer network security;cryptography","DDoS mitigation;Internet-scale attacks;client IP addresses;competitor domains;conditional data sharing;cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets;cryptographic approach;defensive techniques;domains broadcast;legitimate customers;network monitoring data;network security data sharing;privacy concerns;threshold-based policies;whitelist sharing","","0","","39","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first phase of the protocol, we design a trust based packet forwarding scheme for detecting and isolating the malicious nodes using the routing layer information. It uses trust values to favor packet forwarding by maintaining a trust counter for each node. A node is punished or rewarded by decreasing or increasing the trust counter. If the trust counter value falls below a trust threshold, the corresponding intermediate node is marked as malicious. In the next phase of the protocol, we provide link-layer security using the CBC-X mode of authentication and encryption. By simulation results, we show that the proposed MAC-layer security protocol achieves high packet delivery ratio while attaining low delay and overhead.","","978-1-4244-3708-5","978-1-4244-3709-2","10.1109/WICOM.2010.5600904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600904","","Ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Security","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","CBC-X mode;MAC layer security protocol;authentication;encryption;link-layer security;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;packet delivery;routing layer information;trust based security protocol;trust counter;trust threshold;trust values","","3","","11","","","23-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed. After that, Six ML algorithms AdaboostM1, C4.5, Random Forest tree, MLP, RBF and SVM with Polykernel function classifiers are used for IP traffic classification. This implementation and analysis shows that Tree based algorithms are effective ML techniques for Internet traffic classification with accuracy up to of 99.7616 %.","","978-1-4799-2274-1","","10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726074","AdaboostM1;C4.5;Internet Traffic Classification;MLP;Machine Learning;RBF and SVM with Polykernel function;Random Forest tree","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Support vector machines;Training;Vegetation","IP networks;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IP traffic classification;IP traffic identification;IP traffic recognition;Internet traffic classification;Internet traffic flows;MLP;RBF;SVM;TCP port numbers;UDP port numbers;artificial intelligence;classification process;machine learning based Internet traffic recognition;packet attributes;packet capturing tool;packet payloads;polykernel function classifiers;random forest tree;real time Internet traffic;reduced statistical feature dataset;standard attribute selection algorithms;statistical pattern recognition;tree based algorithms;unsupervised learning","","0","","34","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has initiated various security threats, especially in unattended environments. Low Energy Aware Cluster Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the most popular hierarchical routing protocols in WSN that consumes limited energy; thus increases the network lifetime. The security of data transfer via WSN is a challenging issue, especially with the existence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, experimental analysis of the impact of existing DoS attacks on the performance of LEACH protocol, including Flooding attack, Black hole attack and Gray Hole attack will be presented. Secondly, a new DoS attack on LEACH called Scheduling attack will be introduced. In order to check the reliable operation of LEACH routing protocol, all attacks mentioned above are implemented and their impacts on the performance of the LEACH in terms of different metrics including packet delivery ratio, network lifetime and energy consumption have been evaluated.","","","","10.1109/IACS.2015.7103191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103191","Black Hole attack;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray Hole attack;LEACH;NS2;Scheduling attack;WSN;cluster;energy;network lifetime;security","Base stations;Computer crime;Data models;Floods;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","LEACH protocol;WSN;black hole attack;denial of service attacks;energy consumption;flooding attack;gray hole attack;hierarchical routing protocols;low energy aware cluster hierarchy;network lifetime;packet delivery ratio;scheduling attack;security of data transfer;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we progressively enhance the GHSOM to present a new delicate version, named EGHSOM. It consists of a meaningful initialization process instead of random initialization, a novel splitting threshold technique to stabilize the growth topology, merging and pruning methods on neurons to settle the topology and accelerate the detection, and a classification-confidence threshold to detect unknown anomaly in computer networks. The final model is trained using real-time traffic in addition to NSL-KDD and compared with other approaches.

This paper presents an application independent, continual, non-intrusive, fast and easily deployable user re-authentication system based on behavioral biometrics. These behavioral attributes are extracted from the keyboard and mouse operations of the user. They are used to identify and non-intrusively authenticate the user periodically. To extract suitable user attributes, we propose a novel heuristic that uses the percentage of mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio and interaction quotient (IQ). In the re-authentication process, every time, the current behavior of the user is compared with the stored ldquoexpectedrdquo behavior. All deviations are noted and after a certain deviation threshold is reached, the system logs the user out of the current session. The underlying heuristic prevents imposters from misusing the system. Experimental results show that the proposed heuristic can greatly improve the accuracy of application-based and application independent systems to 96.4% and 82.2% respectively.","","978-1-4244-5019-0","978-1-4244-5020-6","10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339075","Behavioral Biometrics;interaction ratio;k-Nearest neighbor;neural networks;statistical analysis;user re-authentication","Authentication;Biometrics;Hardware;Internet;Keyboards;Mice;Neural networks;Pins;Statistical analysis;Testing","biometrics (access control);keyboards;message authentication;mouse controllers (computers);pattern classification;user centred design","behavioral biometrics;identity theft;interaction quotient;masquerading;mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio;user reauthentication systems","","2","6","30","","","28-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prediction is carried out for different random aggregates (obtained through reversible sketches, introduced to improve the scalability of the solution) of traffic flows and, after comparing the prediction error with a threshold, a voting procedure is used to decide about the nature of the current data (with the additional possibility of identifying anomalous flows thanks to the features of reversible sketches).

Botnets are collections of compromised computers which are remotely controlled by its originator (BotMaster) under a common Commond-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure. They provide a distributed platform for several illegal activities such as launching distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against critical targets, malware distribution, phishing, and click fraud. Most of the existing Botnet detection approaches concentrate only on particular Botnet command and control (C&C) protocols (e.g., IRC, HTTP) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become ineffective as Botnets change their structure and C&C techniques. The detection of Botnet has been a major research topic in recent years. Different techniques and approaches have been proposed for detection and tracking of Botnet. This survey classifies Botnet detection techniques into two approaches. One approach is based on setting up honeynets and another approach is based on Intrusion Detection System( IDS) which has been categorized into signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques.","","978-1-4244-5537-9","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563555","Botnet;P2P;bot;malicious activities;patterns","Computational modeling;Computers;Cryptography;Monitoring","Internet;command and control systems;computer crime;cryptographic protocols;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","Botnet detection technique;Commond-and-Control infrastructure;Taxonomy;anomaly based detection technique;compromised computer;cyber attack;distributed denial of service;honeynet;intrusion detection system;malware distribution","","8","","28","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It analyzes the alerts from one or more intrusion detection system and provides a compact summarized report and high-level view of attempted intrusions which highly improves security effectiveness. Correlation component is a procedure which aggregates alerts according to certain criteria. The aggregated alerts could have common features or represent steps of pre-defined scenario attacks. Correlation approaches composed of a single component or a comprehensive set of components. The effectiveness of a component depends heavily on the nature of the dataset analyzed. The order of correlation component will affect the correlation process performance. Moreover not all components should be used for different dataset. This paper presents an agent-based alert correlation model. Learning agent learns the nature of dataset within a network then guides the whole correlation process and components in such a suitable way of which components could be used and in which order. The model improves the performance of correlation process by selecting the proper components to be used.

Existing IDPSs do not seem to provide a satisfactory method of achieving these two conflicting goals. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641","978-1-4244-9330-2","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts.

The drastic increase in network speed and detection workloads necessitates the need for highly efficient network intrusion detection systems(NIDS). Since most NIDSs need to check for a large number of known attack patterns in every packet, pattern matching becomes the most significant part of signature-based NIDSs in terms of processing and memory resources. To support segmentation of network traffic and to detect fragmented attacks, we propose a method which performs both 'partial' and 'full' pattern matching using the data structure CDAWG (Compact Direct Acyclic Word Graph). In the present work, we designed and implemented an efficient string matching algorithm using CDAWG structure. Experimental results show that this algorithm is 2.5 times faster than the currently used Aho-Corasick algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809011","Aho-Corasick;Boyer-Moore;Dawg structure;Snort;intrusion detection;pattern matching;rule database","Computer networks;Computer science;Data structures;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","data structures;digital signatures;security of data;string matching","CDAWG data structure;attack pattern;compact direct acyclic word graph;fragmented attack detection;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;pattern matching algorithm;signature-based NIDS;string matching algorithm","","0","","14","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","25","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology.

We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework.

Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset).

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.","1550-445X","978-1-4799-3629-8","","10.1109/AINA.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655","Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security","Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology","filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection","","0","","19","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, block-level storage systems do not maintain information specific to the file-system using them. The range of threats that can be handled at the block level is limited. A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions. IDStor maintains a block-to-file mapping that is updated online. Using this mapping, IDStor infers the semantics of file-level commands from the intercepted block-level operations, thereby detecting file-level intrusions by merely observing the block read and write commands passing between the hosts and the controller.","","978-1-4244-7152-2","978-1-4244-7153-9","10.1109/MSST.2010.5496974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496974","","Access protocols;Control systems;Event detection;File systems;Home appliances;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Storage area networks;Telecommunication traffic","file organisation;security of data;storage area networks","SAN block storage controller;block level protocol;file level command;file level intrusion detection system;storage area network;storage controller","","1","","18","","","3-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High performance security analytics is proposed to address this challenge by which the real-time event information can be normalized, centralized, and correlated to help identify the current running state of the target environment. As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize, access, and process different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. In this paper, the multi-core architecture is introduced on the event correlation module of SAL platform by which the correlation tasks can be executed in parallel by different computing resources. The k-means algorithm is implemented as an example of possible event clustering and correlation algorithms. Several experiments are conducted and analyzed to show that the performance of analytics can be significantly improved by applying multi-core architecture in the event correlation procedure.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2013.6717881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717881","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Security","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;pattern clustering;security of data;storage management","IT-Infrastructure;SAL platform;SIEM platform;application logs;central interface;central storage;computing resources;correlation algorithms;correlation tasks;event clustering;event correlation module;high performance security analytics;in-memory data management technique;k-means algorithm;management methods;multicore architecture;next generation security information and event management platform];real-time event information;real-time events;security analytics lab;security event correlation;system logs","","0","","8","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud computing uses virtualisation technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its advantages. Virtualisation is the key to consolidate the computing resources to run multiple instances on each hardware, increasing the utilization rate of every resource, thus reduces the number of resources needed to buy, rack, power, cool, and manage. Cloud computing has very appealing features, however, lots of enterprises and users are still reluctant to move into cloud due to serious security concerns related to virtualisation layer. Thus, it is foremost important to secure the virtual environment. In this paper, we present an elastic framework to secure virtualised environment for trusted cloud computing called Server Virtualisation Security System (SVSS). SVSS provide security solutions located on hypervisor for Virtual Machines by deploying malicious activity detection techniques, network traffic analysis techniques, and system resource utilization analysis techniques. SVSS consists of four modules: Anti-Virus Control Module, Traffic Behavior Monitoring Module, Malicious Activity Detection Module and Virtualisation Security Management Module. A SVSS prototype has been deployed to validate its feasibility, efficiency and accuracy on Xen virtualised environment.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038788","","Cloud computing;Malware;Monitoring;Operating systems;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer network security;computer viruses;telecommunication traffic;virtual machines;virtualisation","SVSS;Xen virtualised environment;antivirus control module;cloud computing;computing resource consolidation;effectiveness enhancement;efficiency enhancement;elastic framework;hypervisor;malicious activity detection module;malicious activity detection techniques;network traffic analysis techniques;pay-as-you-go model;resource utilization rate;secure virtualised environment;server virtualisation security system;system resource utilization analysis techniques;traffic behavior monitoring module;trusted cloud computing;virtual machines;virtualisation layer;virtualisation security management module;virtualisation technology","","0","","17","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, sensor nodes are henceforth considered as Internet hosts and may act freely as web clients or servers. Undoubtedly, security and end-users privacy issues rise and become more severe in the IoT, due to the asymmetric nature of the communications between sensor nodes and the ordinary Internet hosts. Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process. For an extreme lightweight end-to-end security, we propose to combine both compression and distribution models for HIP in WSNs side, in the IoT. The partial evaluation results show that the proposed protocol, named compressed and distributed HIP (CD-HIP), is more adapted than the standard HIP, while introducing minor header communication overhead.","","978-1-4799-6608-0","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990267","6LoWPAN compression;Host Identity Protocol;Internet of Tinhgs;IoT;Wireless Sensor Networks;distributed HIP Base Exchange;end-to-end security","Hip;IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;file servers;personal area networks;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN;CD-HIP;IP-based security protocols;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;Web clients;Web servers;communication overhead;compressed and distributed HIP;computational-load distribution techniques;distribution scheme;end-to-end security;host identity protocol;messages compression;wireless sensor networks","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the simulation our approach can mitigated almost 100% of wormhole attack overload in the environment where 54% of nodes are affected with the wormhole.","","978-1-4577-1129-9","978-89-88678-43-5","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058957","","Cryptography;Equations;Monitoring;Routing protocols;Technological innovation;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","distributed network discovery approach;distributed wormhole attack mitigation approach;security mechanisms;sensor devices;wireless sensor networks","","1","","46","","","26-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional hardware solutions are intended for firewall routers. However, the solutions in the literature for firewalls are not scalable, and they do not address the difficulty of an antivirus with an ever-larger pattern set. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396","Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection","Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip","authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching","antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor","","0","","25","","2011-03-28","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","27","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE International Conference on","20091208","2009","","","221","226","Deep packet inspection at high speed has become extremely important due to its application in a wide range of network applications, such as network security and network monitoring. Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) uses a collection of signatures of known security threats and viruses to scan the payload of each packet. Signatures are often specified in the form of regular expressions (regex), called patterns, which are traditionally implemented as finite automata. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is fast, but requires prohibitive amounts of memory which limits their practical use. Instead of matching an incoming packet with each individual regex in a ruleset, we match the packet with a fixed substring, called fingerprint, of a regex first. Fixed string matching is faster and consumes less energy than regex matching. The fact is that if a packet does not match with the fingerprint of a regex, it will not match the regex itself. So fingerprints can be used in a prefilter engine to filter out those packets and do not match any of the fingerprints of the regex in a rule set, which represents normal non-malicious traffic. This actually reduces the number of regex rules being matched, which results in increased throughput of the NIDS. We present a weight scheme to extract a good fingerprint from a regex. A good fingerprint is the one that not only indicates the regex uniquely, but also occurs as less as possible in the matching procedure. We demonstrate how to use fingerprints for efficient prefiltering by means of Bloom filters in practice.","","978-1-4244-4816-6","978-1-4244-4817-3","10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349207","bloom filter;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;prefilter;weight scheme","Automata;Computer viruses;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Filters;Fingerprint recognition;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads","computer viruses;digital signatures;feature extraction;filtering theory;fingerprint identification;finite automata;string matching","Bloom filters;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;fingerprint extraction;fixed string matching;network intrusion detection system;network monitoring;network security;normal nonmalicious traffic;regex matching;regular expressions;ruleset;security threats","","2","2","10","","","16-18 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To construct proper social networks, we first investigate ad hoc MAC and network layer data attributes and select relevant social feature sets; then we build up a set of socio-matrices based on these features. Social analysis methods are applied to these matrices to detect suspicious behaviors of mobile nodes. NS-2 simulation results show that this SN-IDS system can effectively detect common attacks with high detection rates and low false positive alarm rates.

One of the main reasons is insecure routing protocol. Generally ad-hoc network operations utilize reactive routing protocol such as AODV, to complete their routing needs. The route construction phase of this protocol is vulnerable; the malicious node easily disrupts the communication. In one case malicious node sends bulk route request (RREQ) packets to void addresses that occupy the network resources. This type of attack is called RREQ Flooding Attack (RFA). There are various schemes to mitigate the RFA but they are inadequate towards mitigating the attack. One of the main issues present in majority of proposed solutions is not to recover malicious node after punishment. This paper introduces RFAP, a scheme for mitigating the RREQ flooding attack in MANET by utilizing AODV protocol. The RFAP is an amended form of AODV. The scheme is specially design for MANET that has higher node mobility. Recovery of malicious nodes after reasonable punishment is the main objective of the scheme. Simulations are performed using NS-2 simulator and results are presented. These results illustrate that RFAP has ability to separate the flooder node from the network with more reliable as compare to simple AODV.","","978-1-4673-2249-2","","10.1109/INMIC.2012.6511487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511487","AODV;Attack;Flooding attack;MANETs;RFAP;Reactive Routing","","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","AODV;MANET;RFAP;RREQ packets;bulk route request;mobile ad-hoc networks;preventive measure;reactive routing protocol;route request flooding attack","","1","","30","","","13-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Active learning is a family of approaches selecting samples for labeling to build classifier with maximum prediction accuracy. So it is able to improve the performance of intrusion detection while it is not time-costing and labor-consuming. In this paper, definition and some efficient query strategies of active learning are reviewed and suggested.

Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project.","","","","10.1109/QSHINE.2014.6928673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928673","","Data models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;SCADA systems;Training","SCADA systems;radial basis function networks;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","CockpitCI project;K-means recursive clustering;OCSVM model;RBF kernel;SCADA systems;intrusion detection;malicious network traffic;one-class support vector machine;recursive k-means clustering;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unsafe channels","","0","","6","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Intrusion detection in distributed systems, an approach based on taint marking","Hauser, C.; Tronel, F.; Fidge, C.; Me, L.","CIDre Team, Supelec, Rennes, France","Communications (ICC), 2013 IEEE International Conference on","20131107","2013","","","1962","1967","This paper presents a new framework for distributed intrusion detection based on taint marking. Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel. We finally present a scenario of intrusion in a web service running on multiple hosts, and show how our distributed IDS is able to report security violations at each host level.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654811","","Containers;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Protocols;Security","operating system kernels;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Linux kernel;Linux security module;distributed information flow policy;distributed intrusion detection;distributed systems;inter rocess communication abstractions;memory mappings;network packets;peer to peer fashion;security labels;taint marking","","0","","18","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is in operation in Industries, Govt. organization, Banks to guard mission critical data from fraudulent access and tempering. In recent years, with the explosion of Internet, the number of attacks in computer networks is constantly increasing. This is primarily due to the lack of proper authentication of communicating entities in the network. Moreover, the different layer of network is prone to various threats due to vulnerabilities in each of its layers. The layers are independent of each other in functionality and the lower layers provide service to the upper layers. So any compromise in a lower layer will affect all layers above it without the knowledge of the higher layers. So the attacks needs to be classified in layered fashion and their mitigation technique needs to be developed layer wise which means, modern IDS system should also needs to be designed in layered fashion. In this talk, a brief overview of layered approach to Intrusion detection system will be presented by identifying different attacks at different layers in the Internet protocol stack. The need of multiple IDSs for protection of systems will also be discussed.","","978-1-4244-9578-8","","10.1109/NCETACS.2011.5751372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751372","","","Internet;computer network security;protocols","Internet protocol stack;attack mitigation technique;intrusion detection system;network layer specific attack","","0","","","","","4-5 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To cope with these issues, the authors are developing ERESS (Emergency Rescue Evacuation Support System). ERESS is based on Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET) and aims to reduce the number of victims in panic-type disasters. This system consists of new mobile terminals (handset size) with advanced disaster recognition algorithm and acquires sensor information such as acceleration, direction difference and walking steps. Collected information about them is used for detecting the occurrence of a disaster. However, until now, there is no suitable information spreading method for ERESS to collect their information effectively. In this paper we propose three information spreading methods which are suitable for ERESS. The proposed methods are a TTL (Time To Live) control, a transmission power control, and an integrated method using separated sectors. We show the validity of the proposed methods by computer simulations.","","978-1-4673-3071-8","978-1-4673-3069-5","10.1109/ITST.2012.6425277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425277","ERESS;MANET;Panic-type Disasters;TTL","Ad hoc networks;Computer simulation;Delay;Flowcharts;Mobile communication;Power control;Power demand","disasters;emergency services;mobile ad hoc networks;power control;telecommunication terminals","ERESS;MANET;TTL control;advanced disaster recognition algorithm;chemical explosion;computer simulations;earthquakes;emergency rescue evacuation support system;fires;mobile ad-hoc networks;mobile terminals;multihop information spreading methods;panic- type disasters;sensor information;terrorisms;time to live control;transmission power control","","1","","6","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consumer electronic devices have evolved depending on user needs. Users want to use compact and portable devices such as cellular phones, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. anywhere and at anytime to download multimedia data or to access realtime traffic. The mobile Ad Hoc networks have several salient characteristics, such as Dynamic topologies, Bandwidth-constrained, Variable capacity links, Energy-constrained operation and Limited physical security. Due to these features, mobile Ad Hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks launched through compromised node. The communication in mobile AdHoc networks comprises of two phases, the route discovery and the data transmission. In a hostile environment, adversarial nodes can try to disrupt communication in both the two phases. However, consumer electronic devices generally operate on limited battery power and therefore are vulnerable to security threats like data flooding attacks. Flooding attack is a novel and powerful attack against on-demand Ad Hoc routing protocols. At present, FAP (Flooding Attack Prevention) is the single scheme proposed to resist such attack. But it may not give quality of service. In this paper, we present a Period Based Defense mechanism against data flooding attack in wireless AdHoc network. This is the new technique to defend the flooding attack. This scheme is based on the periods and uses a blacklist to efficiently prevent the data flooding attack. The main aim of this paper is to enhance the throughput of burst traffic. As a result of which, many data packets are forwarded at a high rate for the whole duration. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme enhances the throughput of burst traffic.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726662","Data flooding attack;burst traffic;throughput;wireless ad hoc network","Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Quality of service;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PDA;adversarial nodes;bandwidth-constrained variable capacity links;battery power;burst traffic;cellular phones;compromised node;consumer electronic devices;data flooding attacks;data packets;data transmission;denial of service attacks;dynamic topologies;energy-constrained operation;flooding attack prevention;hostile environment;laptop computers;limited physical security;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile users;multimedia data;on-demand ad hoc routing protocols;period based defense mechanism;personal digital assistants;quality of service;realtime traffic;route discovery;security threats;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","5","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes an approach to detecting temporally distributed attacks based on a modified Hierarchical Quilted Self-Organizing Map (HQSOM). The HQSOM approach emulates some aspects of biological neural networks by distributing the reasoning capability throughout a hierarchical structure.
