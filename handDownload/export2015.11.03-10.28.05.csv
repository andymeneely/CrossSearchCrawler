However, the data controllers/owners worried about the privacy and accountability impact of storing their data in the cloud infrastructures as the existing cloud computing solutions provide very limited control on the underlying systems. The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist. In this paper, we address the challenges of determining and detecting unauthorized access to data stored in MapReduce based cloud environments. To this end, we introduce alarm raising honeypots distributed over the data that are not accessed by the authorized MapReduce jobs, but only by the attackers and/or unauthorized users. Our analysis shows that unauthorized data accesses can be detected with reasonable performance in MapReduce based cloud environments.","","978-1-4799-9888-3","","10.1109/ISI.2015.7165951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165951","","Big data;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Cryptography;Data models;Distributed databases","Big Data;cloud computing;cryptography;data analysis;data privacy;parallel processing","Big Data revolution;MapReduce systems;cloud computing;data analytics tasks;data encryption;data processing capabilities;general programming languages;homomorphic encryption methods;honeypot;on-demand scalability;privacy;unauthorized data access detection","","0","","30","","","27-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we explore whether the evolution of web browsers is done using systematic security regression testing. Beginning with an analysis of their current exposure degree to XSS, we extend the empirical study to a decade of most popular web browser versions. We use XSS attack vectors as unit test cases and we propose a new method supported by a tool to address this XSS vector testing issue. The analysis on a decade releases of most popular web browsers including mobile ones shows an urgent need of XSS regression testing. We advocate the use of a shared security testing benchmark as a good practice and propose a first set of publicly available XSS vectors as a basis to ensure that security is not sacrificed when a new version is delivered.","","","","10.1109/ICSTW.2014.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825636","XSS;browser;regression;security;testing;web","Browsers;HTML;Mobile communication;Payloads;Security;Testing;Vectors","online front-ends;regression analysis;security of data","Web applications;Web browser attack surface;XSS vector testing;cross-site scripting;systematic security regression testing","","1","","28","","","March 31 2014-April 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative. Based on these values the Accuracy and error rate of each classifier is computed.","","978-1-4799-5521-3","","10.1109/ICCICT.2015.7045674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045674","Feature selection;Hidden Naïve Bayes;NBTree;Naïve Bayes;classification;discretization","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Data mining;Error analysis;Intrusion detection;Training","data mining;decision trees;feature selection;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","NBTree classifiers;NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes method conditional independence assumption;data dimensionality;data mining approach;data mining model;data preprocessing activities;decision tree classifiers;dimension reduction;feature discretization;feature selection algorithm;hidden Naive Bayes classifiers;machine learning algorithms;record class label identification","","0","","20","","","15-17 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography. We evaluate the performance of our approach in real testbeds, compare it with state-of-the-art protocols, and show that this approach enables efficient and reliable wireless reprogramming.","","978-1-4673-1543-2","","10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289278","","Cryptography;Payloads;Protocols;Reliability;Unicast;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","OTAP protocol;SenSeOP;WSN applications;asymmetric cryptography;efficient wireless reprogramming;location dependency;malicious reprogramming attempts;network-wide dissemination;reliable wireless reprogramming;secure over-the-air programming;selective over-the-air programming;sensing task diversity;sensor hardware heterogeneity;sensor nodes;unauthorized reprogramming attempts;wireless sensor networks","","1","","22","","","July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture can be realized by random-access memory (RAM) and basic logic elements instead of designing new dedicated chips. The bit-split technique is used to reduce the RAM size, and the byte-parallel technique is used to boost the throughput of the architecture. By the particular design and comprehensive experiments with 100 MHz RAM chips, one piece of the architecture can achieve a throughput of up to 1.6 Gbps by 2-byte-parallel input, and we can further boost the throughput by using multiple parallel architectures.","","978-1-4244-5218-7","978-1-4244-5219-4","10.1109/CYBERC.2009.5342207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342207","finite state machine;information retrieval;parallel hardware architecture;string matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer architecture;Hardware;Logic design;Parallel architectures;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Reduced instruction set computing;Throughput","finite state machines;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;random-access storage;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;RAM chip;RAM size;bit-split byte-parallel string matching architecture;finite state machine;frequency 100 MHz;logic element;parallel architecture;random-access memory","","0","","9","","","10-11 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques. The results show that our technique yields fewer false alarms and can handle large traces with smaller (or comparable) processing times compared against the existing techniques for the host based anomaly intrusion detection systems.","","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698896","Host-based Intrusion Detection System;Software Reliability;Software Security","File systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Training","Linux;probability;security of data","Firefox dataset;Linux based program;UNM datasets;anomalous trace;anomaly identification;contemporary test suites;hacking technique;host based anomaly intrusion detection approach;kernel module state;normal trace;state interaction analysis;state occurrence probability;system behaviour visual understanding;system call representation;system call semantic interaction","","2","","38","","","4-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.","1063-6706","","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229","Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning","computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning","","5","","34","","2010-05-20","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","0","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. In addition, hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in cloud, for example, evading an easy-to-exploit machine in a cloud and then using the previous compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from cloud to extract the intensions of the actions recorded in logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the sequence of attack performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model.

The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost. It also shows good scalability when varying the number of dimensions of the reference dataset, the number of objects in the reference dataset, and the number of objects in the query dataset.","","978-1-4244-6356-5","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607480","","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches;Programming","C language;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;optimisation;pattern classification","C language;CUDA optimization techniques;CUDA-enabled GPU;KNN;classification technique;coprocessor;graphics processing units;parallel implementation;parallel k-nearest neighbor algorithm;query dataset;text classification","","3","1","18","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Excellent regular expression engine used in DPI system must be fast, accuracy and less memory usage to match a large volume of data streams, especially in realtime network. In this paper, four open source regular expression match engines are introduced, include Henry Spencer's regex library, PCRE, RE2, and TRE. An evaluation of the four libraries on expressive power, data structure, memory usage and performance is proposed. The evaluation is based on analysis of their source code and black-box testing. Also a list of benchmarks is presented to do this evaluation. The results indicate that PCRE supports more features but has worse performance than other libraries, RE2 performs well on both time and memory usage but does not support backreferences.

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching","","0","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework continuously monitors and analyzes system events and computes the security and risk parameters. An autonomous controller receives security parameters computed by the framework and selects the most appropriate response to protect the cloud against detected attacks, as well as recover any corrupted data or affected services. Beside autonomous response to detected attacks, HA-CIDS has several autonomous capabilities to provide self-resilience and fault tolerance.

Enforcement of network security policies to low level security mechanisms faces some essential difficulties. Consistency, verification, and maintenance are the major ones of these difficulties. One approach to overcome these difficulties is to automate the process of translation of high level security policy into low level security mechanisms. This paper introduces a framework of an automation process that translates a high level security policy into low level security mechanisms. The framework is described in terms of three phases; in the first phase all network assets are categorized according to their roles in the network security and relations between them are identified to constitute the network security model. This proposed model extends the organization based access control (OrBAC) model to include not only access control policy but also some other administrative security policies like auditing policy. Besides, it enables matching of each rule of the high level security policy with the corresponding ones of the low level security policy. Through the second phase, the high level security policy is mapped into the network security model. The second phase could be considered as a translation of the high level security policy into an intermediate model level. Finally, the intermediate model level is translated automatically into low level security mechanism. The paper illustrates the applicability of proposed approach through an application example.","","978-1-4244-3807-5","978-1-4244-3806-8","10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069371","Network security;OrBAC model;Security management;Security modeling;Security policy","Access control;Automation;Computer science;Computer security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Resource management;Specification languages","authorisation;computer network management;telecommunication security","active directory;firewall management;high level network security policy;intrusion detection system;organization-based access control model","","2","","14","","","10-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Congress on","20090529","2009","","","2029","2035","In the paper we present a novel approach based on applying a modern metaheuristic Gene Expression Programming (GEP) to detecting web application attacks. This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","","978-1-4244-2958-5","978-1-4244-2959-2","10.1109/CEC.2009.4983190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4983190","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Web server","SQL;genetic algorithms;online front-ends;query processing;security of data","SQL;Web application attack detection;Web browser;Web server mechanisms;data retrieval;intrusion detection problem;metaheuristic gene expression programming","","1","","15","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, Building up Secure Connection along with Key Factors (BUCK) Filter detects against impersonation attack by broadcasting beacons and detecting the accurate position of the messaged vehicle.

Consequently e-Healthcare application providers are adopting Cloud computing to handle immense processing load and to reduce service delivery cost. Identity management has been an issue which hinders in adoption of e-Healthcare applications, due to sensitivity of the data involved in it. Existing Cloud based e-Healthcare applications provide access to their services though Single-Sign-On (SSO) protocols. Traditional SSO uses asymmetric encryption, thus increasing the execution load on Cloud gateway and on Identity Provider as well. In this paper we propose a methodology of SSO for Cloud applications by utilizing Peer-to-Peer concepts to distribute processing load among computing nodes within Cloud. The proposed scheme, called Chord for Cloud (C4C), decreases the number of authentication request send to Identity Provider and disseminates the authentication process within the federated environment of Cloud, through Chord algorithm.

Thus, the result of clusters can be obtained by repeating the computation process. Because affiliating matrix, obtained by the introduction of SVM into FCM, is defined to be the fuzzy membership function, each different input data sample can have different penalty value, and the separating hyper-plane is optimized.

Our proposed algorithm performs independently partial pattern matching to extract the pattern from incoming multiple packets at multi gigabit network. The IPM is implemented by FPGA, TCAM and SRAM. Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes.

Frequently, the transfer function is designed based on mapping one or two dimensional space to color properties (RGB) and opacity (A). We propose visualization and interaction methods for analyzing individual clusters as well as cluster distribution within and across levels in the cluster hierarchy. We also provide a clustering method that operates on density rather than individual records. We compute density in the given multidimensional multivariate space. Clusters are formed by areas of high density. We present an approach that automatically computes a hierarchical tree of high density clusters. To visually represent the cluster hierarchy, we present a 2D radial layout that supports an intuitive understanding of the distribution structure of the multidimensional multivariate data set. We apply a semi-automatic coloring scheme based on the 2D radial layout of the hierarchical cluster tree encoding hue, saturation, and value of the HSV color space.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm could get a satisfactory performance.","","978-1-4673-0241-8","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295306","Graph-based clustering;cluster precision;intrusion detection;labeling accuracy;outlier detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","data mining;graph theory;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCup99 data set;LDCGB;anomaly intrusion detection system;data mining;graph-based clustering algorithm;graph-based intrusion detection algorithm;initial cluster number;local deviation coefficient;mixed training dataset;muted attacks;outlier affection;outlier detection method;unknown attacks","","1","","14","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server. At the proxy server, data cleaning algorithm is triggered using a sanitizing application. In this framework we include detection and sanitization of the tainted information being sent to the database and innovate a new prototype.","","","","10.1049/cp.2013.2592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950876","Cross Site Scripting Attack;Data Sanitization;Database Security;SQL Attack;SQL Injection;Security Threats","","Internet;SQL;database management systems;query processing;security of data","Internet;SQL code;SQL injection attacker;SQL query;SQL statement;URL;Web application;Web based attacks;application layer attack;confidential information;cross site scripting attack;data redirector program;data security;database attack;database security;illegal approaches;intrusion prevention;proxy server;real-time transaction;reverse proxy framework;sanitization technique;transaction services;unauthorized approaches","","0","","","","","18-19 Oct. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities. Major issues, like insecurities related to Address Resolution Protocol and to self-configurability, are discussed. The solutions fall roughly into three categories: accepting Ethernet's insecurity and circling it with firewalls; creating a logical separation between the switches and end hosts; and centralized cryptography based schemes.

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game.

In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Whenever the intrusion takes place, intrusion detection technology is used to ensure the data integrity and system availability. Normally the intrusion is considered as an abnormal activity performed by the intruder. The breaking of information system or occurrence of any abnormal activity if performed by the intruder is known as intrusion. Based on the nature of access the intruders can be broadly classified into two groups, as internal intruders and external intruders. One who is having the access permission but trying to perform unauthorized or illegal activities is known as internal intruders. On the other hand one who do not have the access permission, but attacks the system with variety of techniques is called identified as external intruders. The IDS is a security management system for the computers and networks. It helps in monitoring and detecting all the activity which takes place in the Network. On consideration, the firewall technology works on the predetermined rule set. In contrast to this, IDS is potential to be present throughout the network as dynamic defense system. Hence it helps to catch all types of attacks. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a method of search through solution space towards an optimal solution that uses the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. The main motivating factor for using GA is that it makes no use of domain knowledge; it works on probabilistic techniques making use of payoff data. Another huge advantage that GA has over other learning systems is that GA is totally unsupervised, once set in motion, it presents the user with a good solution. These coupled with the versatility and robustness of GA makes the technique of choice for this work. This research work focus on applying the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on the classifiers to network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Unlike the other implementations, both temporal and spatial enc- ding information is considered here. It helps in identifying the complex behavior patterns.","","978-1-4799-6804-6","","10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218129","Genetic algorithm;Knowledge base;bayesian classifier;intrusion detection system","Encoding;Engines;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sociology;Statistics","Bayes methods;firewalls;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Bayesian classifier;GA;IDS;complex behavior pattern identification;computer security;data integrity;dynamic defense system;external intruders;firewall technology;genetic algorithm;information system;internal intruders;learning systems;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusion identification;predetermined rule set;probabilistic techniques;security management system;spatial encoding information;system availability;temporal encoding information","","0","","10","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt. For heap overflow vulnerability, we can automatically exploit the unlink() macro of glibc, which formerly requires sophisticated hacking efforts.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2014.2299198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717039","Automatic exploit generation;bug forensics;software crash analysis;symbolic execution;taint analysis","Analytical models;Computer crashes;Concrete;Libraries;Registers;Security;Software","computer crime;program diagnostics;program testing;software fault tolerance;symbol manipulation","Microsoft office word;S<sup>2</sup>E;archiver;attack generation;automatic exploit generation;binary programs;concolic executions;end-to-end approach;format string;foxit;heap overflows;mapped symbolic memory;media player;mitigation-hardened exploits;mpalyer;pdf reader;pseudo symbolic variables;software crash analysis;software failures;software fuzz testing targets;sophisticated hacking efforts;stack overflows;symbolic failure model;symbolic pointers;unrar;word processor","","1","","30","","2014-01-20","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This model is adopted distributed architecture. In order to reduce the relativity of each detection components as far as possible and avoid the simple failure point caused by the single central analyzer, the model is adopted the non-control center multi-SoftMan architecture, which is making enough use of SM attributes, such as independence, activity, self-learning, self-adaptation, self-evolution and society.

In this paper, we first propose rule organized optimal matching (ROOM),which splits the identification rules into several fields and elaborately organizes the matching order of the fields. Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set).

In addition, we implement a prototype system including MP-ROOM and related work for evaluations.The evaluations show very promising results: 1.5 ~71.3 times throughput improvement is obtained by MP-ROOM inthe real system with less than 300-MB memory consumption.

We introduce the most relevant survivable MANET initiatives where either preventive or reactive defenses are combined with tolerant ones. We classify the defense lines taking into account intrusion tolerance mechanisms and also identify properties and requirements of survivability. The initiatives are categorized in three groups: routing discovery, data transmission and key management. For each one, they are correlated in terms of requirements and properties. The survey shows that security solutions do not yet explore relevant survivability properties and have only focused on one network layer or one type of attack.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2009.090106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796927","Survivability, Intrusion Tolerance, MANETs, Security","Communication system control;Communication system security;Cryptographic protocols;Data communication;Data security;Mechanical factors;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;data communication;mobile radio;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing","data transmission;intrusion tolerance mechanisms;key management;mobile ad hoc networks;routing discovery;telecommunication security","","20","","68","","","First Quarter 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such systems require support for advanced regex matching features, such as start offset reporting and capturing groups. However, existing regex matching architectures based on reconfigurable nondeterministic state machines and programmable deterministic state machines are not designed to support such features. We describe a novel architecture that supports such advanced features using a network of state machines. We also present a compiler that maps the regexs onto such networks that can be efficiently realized on reconfigurable logic. For each regex, our compiler produces a state machine description, statically computes the number of state machines needed, and produces an optimized interconnection network. Experiments on an Altera Stratix IV FPGA, using regexs from a real life text analytics benchmark, show that a throughput rate of 16 Gb/s can be reached.","","","","10.1109/FPL.2013.6645534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645534","","Delays;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Multiprocessor interconnection;Registers;Semantics","field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;knowledge acquisition;pattern matching;relational algebra;text analysis","Altera Stratix IV FPGA;bit rate 16 Gbit/s;capturing groups;compiler;dictionary processing;hardware-accelerated regular expression matching;high-throughput text analytics;information extraction;optimized interconnection network;programmable deterministic state machines;reconfigurable logic;reconfigurable nondeterministic state machines;regex matching architectures;relational algebra;start offset reporting;text documents","","3","","20","","","2-4 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem is especially challenging in the world of network intrusion detection. In this realm, we must not only deal with sifting through vast amounts of data, but we must also do it in a timely manner even when at times we are not sure what exactly it is we are trying to find. In the grander scheme of our work we intend to demonstrate that several different data mining algorithms reporting to an overarching layer will yield more accurate results than anyone data mining application (or algorithm) acting on its own. The system will operate in the domain of offline network and computer forensic data mining, under the guidance of a hybrid intelligence/multi-agent, systems based, for interpretation and interpolation of the findings. Toward that end, in this paper we build upon earlier work, undertaking the steps required for generating and preparing suitably minable data. Specifically, we are concerned with extracting as much useful data as possible out of a PCAP (Packet capture) for importing into Weka. While a PCAP may have thousands of field/value pairs, Wireshark and tshark's csv (comma separated value) output module only renders a small percentage of these fields and their values by default. We introduce a tool of our own making which enumerates every field (with or without a value) in any PCAP and generates an ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format - Weka default). This code represents a component of a larger application we are designing (future work) which will ingest a PCAP, semi-autonomously preprocess it and feed it into Weka for processing/mining using several different algorithms.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888681","ARFF;Data Mining;Intrusion Detection Systems;PCAP;PDML;Weka","Artificial intelligence;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Intrusion detection","data mining;security of data","PCAP;Weka mineable data;attribute relation file format - weka default;computer forensic data mining;data mining algorithms;hybrid intelligence multiagent;information overload problem;network intrusion detection;offline network;packet capture","","1","","20","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions. Experimental results show that our algorithm has higher detection accuracy than other approaches based on outlier detection or change-point detection.","2166-0778","978-1-4673-2318-5","978-0-7695-4770-1","10.1109/SRII.2012.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310988","Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Opportunistic adversary","Automation;Business;Decision trees;Humans;Insurance;Machine learning;Training","business data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","change-point detection;countermeasure algorithm;human decision processes;imminent threats;machine-learning-based business process automation;misclassification cases;opportunistic adversaries;outlier detection;post-classification data distributions;real-world classification problems;reduced classification accuracy","","0","","20","","","24-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on development of a behavior analysis tool on any operating system and its use on detecting internal active/passive attacks. Many kinds of tools and firewalls are in market to help network administrator to prevent intrusion from outside network, but very few tools to stop attacks from internal part of the network. This tool provides a way to detect any unusual behavior by a legitimate user in a network. It uses packet sniffer like Wireshark to record log traffic over a network. Furthermore, behavioral analysis is carried in two phases. In the first phase, Wireshark records the user's interaction with the network for a period of time and is stored in database. In second phase, current activity is compared to the past activity and notifies any new behavior to network administrator. This tool adds an additional layer of security along with the intrusion detection systems available from any network attacks. Many additional features can be incorporated in this tool for future enhancement.","","978-1-61284-485-5","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6014810","Network behavior analysis (NBA);Packet capture;network administrator (NA)","Electronic publishing;Filtering;Information services;Internet","pattern matching;security of data","Wireshark;behavior analysis tool;behavior based network traffic analysis tool;behavioral analysis;firewalls;intrusion detection system;log traffic;network administrator;network model;operating system;packet sniffer;pattern matching system;user statistics","","3","","8","","","27-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using HEs, DAPs and SEMs as examples, it is demonstrated that a behavior-rule based intrusion detection technique can effectively trade false positives for a high detection probability to cope with sophisticated and hidden attackers to support ultra safe and secure applications.

Furthermore, context awareness has become popular to accompany these services not only to enhance the users' perceived service quality but also to improve the overall utilization of such cooperative networks. However, delivering context-aware multimedia content through these cooperative networks is associated with a significant research challenge due to the inherently different satellites and terrestrial networks technologies. For example, to provide context-specific TV programs to a user, a satellite needs to adopt unicast-style delivery. This may be an expensive operation since satellites are intrinsically useful for broadcasting or multicasting services to a wide audience. In contrast, terrestrial communication networks can be better suited to perform unicast-based context-aware content delivery. In this article, we address these challenges, and propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation method to effectively utilize the satellite and terrestrial networks for providing context-aware contents to many users. Computer-based simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6829945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829945","","Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Context-aware services;Multimedia communication;Satellite broadcasting;Streaming media","bandwidth allocation;cooperative communication;multicast communication;multimedia communication;radio networks;satellite communication;ubiquitous computing","computer-based simulation;context-aware multimedia content delivery;context-specific TV programs;cooperative satellite cells;cooperative satellite network;dynamic bandwidth allocation method;multicasting services;terrestrial wireless communication networks;unicast-based context-aware content delivery;unicast-style delivery;user perceived service quality","","0","","","","","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
