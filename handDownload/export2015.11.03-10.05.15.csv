In the last few years, Cloud computing has grown from being a promising business concept to one of the fast growing segments of the IT industry. Despite of all the hype surrounding the Cloud, enterprise customers are still reluctant to deploy their business in the Cloud. Security is one of the major issues which reduces the growth of Cloud computing and complications with data privacy and data protection continue to plague the market. In this paper, we propose a solution for Hybrid Cloud security, focusing on a Virtual Intrusion Detection System (V-IDS). We present a new architecture that considers the basic principles of the Cloud computing, virtualization and GMPLS Control Plane and applies them to the intrusion detection systems, in order to protect Cloud networks characterized by constantly changing of the underlying infrastructure and physical topology. Based on the defined architecture, we have implemented a prototype of Cloud based IDS that validates our thesis. The prototype is realized though the integration of two open-source technologies: OpenStack and DRAGON (Dynamic Resource Allocation via GMPLS Optical Networks).","","978-8-8872-3721-4","","10.1109/EMTC.2014.6996640","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996640","Cloud Computing;Network Management;Path Computation Element;Secure Networking","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Prototypes;Real-time systems","cloud computing;computer network security;data privacy","DRAGON;Dynamic Resource Allocation via GMPLS Optical Networks;GMPLS control plane;IT industry;OpenStack;V-IDS;cloud based IDS;cloud computing;cloud network security;data privacy;data protection;distributed services;enterprise customers;hybrid cloud security;open-source technologies;transparent access;virtual intrusion detection system;virtualization","","0","","25","","","12-15 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, existing solutions are not effective to provide protection and security against attacks sinkhole on IoT, and they also introduce high consumption of resources de memory, storage and processing. Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative, as well as the high resource cost. The system combines watchdog, reputation and trust strategies for detection of attackers by analyzing the behavior of devices. Results show the INTI performance and its effectiveness in terms of attack detection rate, number of false positives and false negatives.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140344","","Base stations;Internet of things;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;security of data","6LoWPAN;INTI;Internet of Things;IoT networks;intrusion detection system;secure routing;sinkhole attacks","","0","","16","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing models assume that the distributions for transitions between states are exponential. However, this assumption does not hold in many real cases. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-Markov survivability evaluation model, which allows the transitions between states to follow nonexponential distributions. Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, a real intrusion tolerant database system ITDB is implemented to validate the proposed state-space models. Empirical experiments show that the semi-Markov model predicts the system behaviors with high accuracy. Furthermore, in this paper we evaluate the impact of intrinsic system deficiencies and attack behaviors on the survivability of intrusion tolerant database systems.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438108","Database Security;Intrusion Tolerance;Modeling and Evaluation;Semi-Markov Process;Survivability","Availability;Benchmark testing;Data security;Database systems;Degradation;Educational institutions;Humans;Information security;Predictive models","Markov processes;database management systems;reliability theory;security of data;state-space methods","ITDB;intrinsic system deficiencies;intrusion tolerant database systems;nonexponential distributions;novel quantitative measures;resilient system;semi Markov survivability evaluation model;state-space models;system behaviors","","2","","19","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

(NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan","Wireless Advanced (WiAd), 2011","20110811","2011","","","36","41","Secure routing is an important issue in MANETs. Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV. This implies that we have achieved added security with less additional cost to the system.","","978-1-4577-0110-8","","10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983282","Performance;SAODV;routing attacks on AODV","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocols;MANET;SAODV routing protocols;asymmetric key cryptography;exchanged control messages;network routing attacks;secure routing;temporal time stamping;vulnerability assessment","","1","","18","","","20-22 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the proliferation of sensor networks at home, work place, and beyond, securing data in the network has become a challenge. A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol. We have also performed a number of statistical tests and cryptanalytic attacks to evaluate the security strength of the algorithm and found the cipher provably secure.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2380816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985604","Chaotic map;Crossover;Data Encryption;Elliptic curve;Mutation;Pseudorandom bit sequence generator;Wireless Sensor Network;Wireless sensor network;chaotic map;crossover;data encryption;elliptic curve;mutation;pseudorandom bit sequence generator","Ciphers;Elliptic curves;Encryption;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","chaotic communication;computational complexity;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;random sequences;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","KATAN;LED protocol;Mica2 sensor mote;TWINE protocol;XOR;chaotic map parameters;computational complexity;cryptanalytic attacks;cryptographic scheme;data blocks;elliptic curve points;encryption scheme;encryption system;environmental management;genetic operations;industry control;lightweight block cipher;pseudorandom bit sequence;security mechanisms;security strength;statistical tests;strategic surveillance;structural health monitoring;wireless sensor networks","","1","","31","","2014-12-18","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Second International Symposium on","20091023","2009","2","","34","38","High-speed packet content inspection and filtering devices rely on a fast multi-pattern matching algorithm which is used to detect predefined keywords or signatures in the packets. In TCP, a communication data stream is split into packets. Therefore, a target pattern may span multiple packets. Such fragmented pattern cannot be discovered by a per-packet scan. This is a serious problem in applications such as NIDS that require a complete scan. To avoid the problem, it is necessary to scan TCP streams. Stream-level parallelism is not a substantial solution because bandwidth depends on the number of active TCP streams. To scan each stream separately using one matching unit, the match states must be swapped appropriately. Another problem is, as parts of network infrastructure, the inspection units should support the function of QoS. In this paper, we proposed a multi-pattern matching automaton DSC-AC for high speed multi-stream packet scanning. We given out the construction of DSC-AC and optimized it with optimal and two binary searching tree and bit-map AC. Analysis and test showed that the optimized DSC-AC is capable of lightweight switching , enables a little state saving between streams and support the Diff-Serv Qos model. Furthermore, our method also enables easy implementation of multi-stream scanners with high throughput.","","978-0-7695-3643-9","","10.1109/ISECS.2009.144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209819","Automaton;High-speed network;Multi-stream Content Detection;Pattern Matching","Automata;Bandwidth;Filtering algorithms;Information technology;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Testing;Throughput","DiffServ networks;pattern matching;quality of service;transport protocols","Diff-Serv;QoS;TCP;binary searching tree;bit-map AC;multipattern matching;multistream content detection;packet content inspection;packet scanning","","0","","12","","","22-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.","","978-1-4799-5062-1","","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823","Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen","Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection","","0","","26","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods. The obtained results show that the new AACK scheme outperforms both of the TWOACK and Watchdog methods in terms of network packet delivery ratio and routing overhead.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474764","AACK;DSR;IDS;MANET;Misbehaving;TWOACK;Watchdog;packet dropping","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Power system protection;Protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing","MANET;adaptive acknowledgment intrusion detection;authentication solutions;encryption;forward packets;mobile ad-hoc network;network packet delivery ratio;node detection enhancement;routing overhead;wireless links","","4","","20","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of open networks poses many challenges for control systems. The classical design of control systems takes into account modeling uncertainties as well as physical disturbances, providing a multitude of control design methods such as robust control, adaptive control, and stochastic control. With the growing level of integration of control systems with new information technologies, modern control systems face uncertainties not only from the physical world but also from the cybercomponents of the system. The vulnerabilities of the software deployed in the new control system infrastructure will expose the control system to many potential risks and threats from attackers. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to severe damage as has been reported in various news outlets [1], [2].

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6","978-1-4244-6024-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"DNS-IDS: Securing DNS in the Cloud Era","Satam, Pratik; Alipour, Hamid; Al-Nashif, Youssif; Hariri, Salim","","Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC), 2015 International Conference on","20151029","2015","","","296","301","Recently, there has been a rapid growth in cloud computing due to their ability to offer computing and storage on demand, its elasticity, and significant reduction in operational costs. However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.","","","","10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172","Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training","","","","","","","","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implemented system is referred to by WINIDC (Wireless Sensors and Neural Networks for Intruders Detection and Classification). WINIDC has been designed to detect intruders of many sizes and types. It can be considered as a smart and economical solution for the addressed surveillance problem. It is smart as it utilizes artificial neural networks to classify the different types of intruders. It is economical as it utilizes small, cheap wireless sensor nodes that are self-powered and self-configuring. Traditional solutions to such surveillance problem are expensive, complex and hard to maintain. The results show that integrating ANNs along with WSNs allow for real-time and accurate detection and classification of intruders.

To cater these issues, a formal approach is required that has more expressiveness and equipped with reasoning. These traits are fully adhered to by the Semantic techniques.

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303","978-1-4673-1565-4","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","0","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks. Our classifier detects those five attacks with high accuracy and does so in a timely manner.","0890-8044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.5274916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274916","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Protection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","discovery of attacks;intrusion detection system;network security;network-based attacks;packet dynamics","","1","","20","","","September 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite the burgeoning literature, accurate detection of malware remains an elusive and challenging endeavor due to the increasing usage of payload encryption and sophisticated obfuscation methods. Also, the large variety of malware classes coupled with their rapid proliferation and polymorphic capabilities and imperfections of real-world data (noise, missing values, etc) continue to hinder the use of more sophisticated detection algorithms. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to detect known and newly emerging malware at a high precision using layer 3 and layer 4 network traffic features. The framework leverages the accuracy of supervised classification in detecting known classes with the adaptability of unsupervised learning in detecting new classes. It also introduces a tree-based feature transformation to overcome issues due to imperfections of the data and to construct more informative features for the malware detection task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using real network data from a large Internet service provider.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-5944-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567003","","Feature extraction;Kernel;Malware;Payloads;Support vector machines;Training;Unsupervised learning","Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);tree data structures","Internet service provider;Internet today;layer 3 network traffic features;layer 4 network traffic features;obfuscation methods;payload encryption;polymorphic capabilities;security threats;supervised learning;tree-based feature transformation;unsupervised learning;zero-day malware detection","","4","","13","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A node is considered malicious if its behavior significantly differs from its neighbors. This detection technique is localized, unsupervised and adapts to changing network dynamics. Although the technique is promising, it has not been deeply researched in the context of wireless sensor networks yet. In this paper, we present symptoms which can be used in the neighbor-based technique for detection of selective forwarding, jamming and hello flood attacks. We implemented an intrusion detection system which employs the neighbor-based detection technique. The system was designed for and works on the TinyOS operating system running the Collection Tree Protocol. We evaluated accuracy of the technique in the detection of selective forwarding, jamming and hello flood attacks. The results show that the neighbor-based detection technique is highly accurate, especially in the case when collaboration among neighboring nodes is used.","","978-1-4244-8021-0","978-0-7695-4182-2","10.1109/ICWMC.2010.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628755","intrusion detection system;neighbor-based detection technique;wireless sensor network","Base stations;Collaboration;Databases;Gaussian distribution;Jamming;Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;jamming;operating systems (computers);security of data;wireless sensor networks","TinyOS operating system;collection tree protocol;hello flood attacks;jamming;neighbor-based intrusion detection;network dynamics;selective forwarding;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","8","","11","","","20-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the algorithm, the input data was regarded as antigens, and antibodies are regarded as the hidden layer centers. The weights of the output layer are determined by adopting the Recursive least square method, which can improve convergence speed and precision of the RBF neural network.

Thus, useful information should be determined to perform accurate detection and hence perform good protection. In this paper, a new approach to collect useful data from the network is proposed.

WLANs have gone through rapid changes with respect to their security standards in near time. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is one of the most catastrophic attacks in WLAN. Stealth MITM (SMITM) attack is a new way of doing MITM based on Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning. In this attack, ARP poisoning is done directly to the victim by forging the frame ARP response protocol structure and exploiting WPA2 key management. In this paper we propose a Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) for SMITM attack. The proposed WIDS successfully detects the SMITM attack and other similar attacks like MITM (using ARP poisoning) and IP Spoofing. The proposed WIDS system is simulated in NS-3 network simulator and the scheme is found to work correctly when the attacker is static and is under the coverage of a single sensor during the complete period of attack.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449834","","Local area networks;Logic gates;Probes;Programmable logic arrays;Quality of service;Transmitters;Uplink","computer network security;protocols;wireless LAN","ARP;IP spoofing;NS-3 network simulator;SMITM;WIDS;address resolution protocol;man-in-the-middle attack;security standards;stealth MITM;stealth detection;wireless LAN;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area networks","","3","","9","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To answer this question, we conduct a study from three recent data sources. Specifically, we focus on the following broad questions: (a) how are email addresses harvested, (b) where is spam coming from, and (c) how does spam evolve over time. First, we discuss whether spammers still use email harvesting: 34% of the honeypot accounts we publicised received spam after 72 days on average. Interestingly, we find that simple email address obfuscation is quite effective against harvesting. Second, we identify significant skew in the spatial distribution of the origin of spam in both the IP-level and AS-level of granularity. We find that 20% of the active IPs are responsible for 80% of the total volume of spam and that 10% of the spamming ASes are responsible for the 90% of the volume. Finally, we study the temporal characteristics of the spamming IPs and find that spam activity has spread to new /8 subnetworks since 2006. Considering these spatio-temporal trends, the future of anti-spam is mixed: the current skewed spatial distribution of spam sources could be helpful in filtering spam, but the fact that spam sources are spreading in the IP space is a worrisome sign.","","978-1-4577-1392-7","","10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6089060","","Distribution functions;Educational institutions;HTML;IP networks;Servers;Unsolicited electronic mail","IP networks;Internet;information filtering;security of data;unsolicited e-mail","AS-level;IP-level;anti-spam;email address;email harvesting;honeypot account;network-level characteristics;spam activity;spam filtering;spam source;spamming IP","","1","","29","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security issues.","","978-1-4577-1449-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978790","Cloud Computing;Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Debugging;Programming;Protocols;Security;Software","Web services;cloud computing;invasive software","Web security threats;Web services;anti-malware;cloud computing;information and communication technology;injection vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;protection tools;security issues;security measures;utility computing","","0","","48","","","1-2 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an adaptive array is used to find the direction to the jamming source despite the presence of interference signals transmitted by both legitimate network nodes and external sources. Unlike other direction-finding algorithms, the desired-signal classification (DESIC) algorithm requires no information or special assumptions about the interference signals to effectively cancel them and find the desired direction. Simulation experiments show that the DESIC algorithm provides an excellent performance in many scenarios, even when the received signals cannot be resolved by the widely used MUSIC algorithm.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415599","","Arrays;Direction of arrival estimation;Fading;Interference;Monitoring;Multiple signal classification;Vectors","jamming;radio receivers;signal classification;spread spectrum communication","DESIC algorithm;MUSIC algorithm;adaptive array;compromised node;desired-signal classification;direction finding;interference signals;jamming signal;jamming source;spread-spectrum network;spread-spectrum receiver","","1","","11","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different features have different importance, which are often described by weights. So how to adaptively learning weights of different features is a very key issue in CBR, which impact directly the quality and performance of case extraction. Currently, in most practical CBR systems, the feature weights are given by domain experts subjectively. In this paper, we propose a PID operator-based feature weight learning method based on the fundamental theory of the control system. PID-based feature weighting method is a self-adaptive method, which utilizing the similar neural network architecture to construct the case base. Through designing 3 kinds of adjusting operators: Proportional, integral and derivative operator (PID), and each operator with different properties: reactive, prudent and sensitive, we can adjust the feature weight from different point of views, such as the current adjust results, the history results or the last two results. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, the experiment of network anomaly detection is conducted and the experimental results show that all 3 operators are effective which can converge the intrusion detection system into a stable state in relative small iterations.","","978-0-7695-3507-4","","10.1109/CSIE.2009.355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170599","Feature Weight Learning;Intrusion Detection;PID operators","Application software;Computer science;Control systems;Costs;History;Indexing;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Neural networks;Three-term control","adaptive control;case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neurocontrollers;security of data;self-adjusting systems;stability;three-term control","CBR system;PID-based feature weight learning method;adaptively learning weight;case-based reasoning;domain expert;intrusion detection system;network anomaly detection;neural network architecture;proportional-integral-and-derivative operator;self-adaptive method;stable state","","0","","16","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, if these nodes have been misbehavior nodes then they can send false information to other nodes or report an innocent node as destructive. In our proposed scheme, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level intrusion detection is presented to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques. The network is divided to zones with one zone manager which is monitoring on cluster heads in its zone, but the most important problem is how can recognize the trustworthiness of zone manager which is done by âhonest neighborsâ of zone manager. These honest neighbors prevent false accusations, and also allow manager if it is wrongly misbehaving, but if manger repeats its misbehaving then it will lose its management degree.","","978-1-4244-6708-2","","10.1109/UMEDIA.2010.5543917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5543917","","Authentication;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","computer network management;computer network security;groupware;open systems","collaborative honest neighbour;distributed architecture;hierarchical architecture;hybrid architecture;intrusion detection system;management degree;zone manager","","0","","12","","","5-6 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, and exploit this questionable assumption to subvert VM introspection. In particular, we present an attack called DKSM (Direct Kernel Structure Manipulation), and show that it can effectively foil existing VM introspection solutions into providing false information.

Anomaly-based IDSs need to be able to learn the dynamically changing behavior of users or systems. In this paper, we are experimenting with packet behavior as parameters in anomaly intrusion detection. There are several methods to assist IDSs to learn system's behavior.

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48. However, accuracy for this hybrid technique is slightly lower compared to others.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122808","Intrusion detection system;accuracy;artificial immune recognition system;false alarm rate;rough set theory","Accuracy;Data mining;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","artificial immune systems;computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program debugging;rough set theory","AIRS1 algorithm;AIS;DOS attack;IT department;J48 algorithm;NSL-KDD;Rough-AIRS 1;artificial immune recognition system;artificial immune system;denial of service attack;false alarm rate;flood attack;incremental learning approach;intrusion detection system;memory storage;redundant feature;rough set theory;security threat;software bug","","0","","15","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a dataset containing hundreds of variants for several major malware families, our method achieves 98.6% classification accuracy using the signatures generated by the DBN. The presented method is completely agnostic to the type of malware behavior that is logged (e.g., API calls and their parameters, registry entries, websites and ports accessed, etc.), and can use any raw input from a sandbox to successfully train the deep neural network which is used to generate malware signatures.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280815","Autoencoders;Automatic Signature Generation;Deep Belief Network;Deep Learning;Malware","Malware;Training","belief networks;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","DBN;DeepSign;automatic malware signature classification;automatic malware signature generation;deep belief network;deep learning;deep neural network;deep stack denoising autoencoders;deep unsupervised neural network;malware behavior invariant compact representation;malware families","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These requirements are becoming more fine-grained, where access control depends on heterogeneous isolation patterns like access deny, trusted communication, and payload inspection. However, organizations are looking to design usable and optimal security configurations that can harden the network security within enterprise budget constraints. This requires analyzing various alternative security architectures in order to find a security design that satisfies the organizational security requirements as well as the business constraints. In this paper, we present ConfigSynth, an automated framework for synthesizing network security configurations by exploring various security design alternatives to provide an optimal solution. The main design alternatives include different kinds of isolation patterns for traffic flows in different segments of the network. ConfigSynth takes security requirements and business constraints along with the network topology as inputs. Then it synthesizes optimal and cost-effective security configurations satisfying the constraints. ConfigSynth also provides optimal placements of different security devices in the network according to the given network topology. ConfigSynth uses Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) for modeling this synthesis problem. We demonstrate the scalability of the tool using simulated experiments.","1063-6927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2013.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681625","automatic synthesis;constraints;formal logic;security configuration","Business;Equations;Mathematical model;Network topology;Payloads;Security;Usability","Internet;authorisation;business data processing;computability;computer network security;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","ConfigSynth;Internet services;SMT;access deny;alternative security architectures;business constraints;enterprise budget constraints;enterprise networks;formal framework;heterogeneous isolation patterns;network security configuration synthesis;network security design synthesis;network topology;optimal security configurations;organizational security requirements;payload inspection;resource access control;satisfiability modulo theories;security threats;synthesis problem modeling;traffic flows;trusted communication","","0","","15","","","8-11 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For systems whose lion share of service is delivered by (embedded) software, process-centred methods are seen to be no longer sufficient. Recent safety norms (for example, ISO 26262) thus prescribe the use of safety models for both hardware and software. However, failure rates or probabilities for software are difficult to justify. Only if developers take good design decisions from the outset will they achieve safety goals efficiently. To support safety-oriented navigation of the design space and to bridge the existing gap between qualitative analyses for software and quantitative ones for hardware, we propose a fault-tree-based approach to the safety analysis of software-controlled systems. Assigning intervals instead of fixed values to events and using Monte-Carlo sampling, probability mass functions of failure probabilities are derived. Further analysis of PMF lead to estimates of system quality that enable safety managers to take an optimal choice between design alternatives and to target cost-efficient solutions in every phase of the design process.","1071-9458","978-1-4244-5375-7","978-0-7695-3878-5","10.1109/ISSRE.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362097","Embedded systems;fault tree analysis;probability intervals;safety;simulation;software.","Bridges;Embedded software;Fault trees;Hardware;ISO standards;Navigation;Sampling methods;Software measurement;Software quality;Software safety","Monte Carlo methods;fault trees;sampling methods;software quality","ISO 26262;Monte-Carlo sampling;embedded software;failure probabilities;failure rates;fault tree analysis;probability mass functions;process-centred methods;safety-related quality;second-order probabilities;software-controlled component systems","","2","","45","","","16-19 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensuring the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability of these detectors as well as to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems consist of basic information related to the TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11-specific attacks such as deauthentication attacks or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11-specific intrusions. Our model for feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a means to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm. In the experimental section of this paper, we study the impact of the optimization of the feature set for wireless intrusion detection systems on the performance and learning time of different types of classifiers based on neural networks. Experimental results with three types of neural network architectures clearly show that the optimization of a wireless feature set has a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the intrusion detection system.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226620","Feature selection;K-means;information gain ratio;intrusion detection systems;neural networks.;wireless networks","","feature extraction;neural net architecture;optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;transport protocols;wireless LAN","MAC layer DoS attack;TCP/IP header;feature reduction;hybrid model;k means classifier;lower level protocol frames;network resources;neural network architecture;optimal set;wireless feature set;wireless intrusion detection system","","9","","26","","2009-08-28","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we give an explanation to this problem from the prospective of information theory, and propose a multidimensional mathematical model focusing on the most serious state explosion. We divide redundant states into zero-dimensional ones and one-dimensional ones. The former are compressed by dimension, and the later are dynamically built. Theory proof illustrates that the space complexity of the model reaches the theoretical lower bound. Then we propose the multi-dimensional finite automata (MFA) based on the model.

This act is called jamming and the malicious nodes are referred to as jammers. Jamming techniques vary from simple ones based on the continual transmission of interference signals, to more sophisticated attacks that aim at exploiting vulnerabilities of the particular protocol used. In this survey, we present a detailed up-to-date discussion on the jamming attacks recorded in the literature. We also describe various techniques proposed for detecting the presence of jammers.

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a ÃÂ¿gray boxÃÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","978-0-7695-3816-7","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","1","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can measure the association relations accurately and robustly.","","","","10.1109/SKG.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816584","Association Link Network;semantic link network;video organizing;video representing","Cognition;Organizing;Publishing;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web pages;YouTube","Internet;Web sites;video retrieval","Flickr;YouTube;association link network model;association-rich network;cognitive science;intelligent Web activities;semantic content;semantic link network;video representation;video resources organization","","0","","24","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this research paper is to implement a security plan for the Lawson healthcare organization to assist with protecting and providing a secure information transmission and exchange of public and private data. The current healthcare security system is outdated and it does not protect public or private data exchange across the network. There are IT personnel who are uneducated on the security mechanism to prevent security risks within the daily operations of the healthcare systems. The development of new operational security architecture is to reduce threats and educate the IT personnel of techniques to improve the outdated security mechanism being used in the Healthcare organization.

Current integrity detection systems have some disadvantages, for example, they cannot protect themselves well or the dependence between the detection results and the target system is high. We refer to the problem as lack of transparency. This paper presents a novel online integrity checker, Block Tapping, which ensures its security benefiting from the isolation property of virtual machine. Block tapping monitors the block-level data streams transparently through block-to-file semantic-translation at the virtual block device layer. Based on the self-described information of virtual storages, Block Tapping detects the file-level malicious behaviors independent of the internal state of the compromised virtual machine. Experiments show that the prototype system successfully captures 13 typical user-mode root kit attacks against virtual storage, and the performance overhead is acceptable.","1521-9097","978-1-4577-1875-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121331","Data Integrity;Transparent Detection;Virtual Storage","Databases;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes;Semantics;Synchronization;Virtual machining","data integrity;data privacy;file organisation;virtual machines;virtual storage","Xen-based computing platform;block-level data stream;block-to-file semantic-translation;blocktapping;file-level malicious behavior;online transparent integrity checker;virtual block device layer;virtual computing environment;virtual machine;virtual storage","","0","","23","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) which are based on sophisticated algorithms rather than current signature-base detections are in demand. There is often the need to update an installed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) due to new attack methods or upgraded computing environments. Since many current Intrusion Detection Systems are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to them are expensive and slow. In data mining-based intrusion detection system, we should make use of particular domain knowledge in relation to intrusion detection in order to efficiently extract relative rules from large amounts of records. This paper proposes new ensemble boosted decision tree approach for intrusion detection system. Experimental results shows better results for detecting intrusions as compared to others existing methods.","","978-1-4244-9033-2","","10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640375","boosted decision trees;data mining;ensemble approach;network intrusion detection system","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection","data mining;security of data","boosted decision tree;data mining;domain knowledge;intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection model","","8","","18","","","17-19 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952","978-1-4673-0228-9","978-1-4673-0227-2","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we design and implement a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of TorWard. Our data shows that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malware have been identified. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to perform malicious traffic categorization over Tor.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848074","Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Traffic;Tor","Bandwidth;Computers;Logic gates;Malware;Mobile handsets;Ports (Computers);Servers","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","DoS;IDS;IDS alerts;P2P traffic;Tor exit routers;denial-of-service attack traffic;intrusion detection system;low-latency anonymous communication system;malicious traffic categorization;malicious traffic discovery;spam","","2","","43","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, today we are dominated by short-view capabilities driven by misuse based strategies; triggered by the structural qualities of attack vectors. The structural aspects of cyber threats are in a constant flux, rendering most defensive technologies reactive to previously unknown attack vectors. Unlike structural signature based approaches, both the real-time and aggregate behaviors exhibited by cyber threats over a network provide insight into making-sense of anomalies found on our networks. In this work, we explore the challenges posed in identifying and developing a set of behavior primitives that facilitate the creation of threat narratives use to describe cyber threats anomalies. Thus, we investigate the use aggregate behaviors derived from network flow data establishing initial behavior models used to detect complex cyber threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Our cyber data fusion prototype employs a unique layered methodology that extracts features from network flow data aggregating it by time. This approach is more scalable and flexible in its application in large network data volumes. The preliminary evaluation of the proposed methodology and supporting models shows some promising results.","2325-5366","978-1-4799-0450-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568370","Behavior analysis;aggregate behaviors;anomaly detection;machine learning;network flow analysis","Aggregates;Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Vectors","feature extraction;security of data;sensor fusion;support vector machines","APT;advanced persistent threats;aggregate behaviors;aggregate network features;attack vector structural quality;behavior primitives;cyber data fusion prototype;cyber threat structural aspects;feature extraction;initial behavior models;long-view situation awareness;misuse based strategy;network flow data;operational capability;short-view capability;support vector machines;threat agents","","2","","30","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
