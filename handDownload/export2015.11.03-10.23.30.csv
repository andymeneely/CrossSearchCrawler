Intentional interference (jamming) attacks can be performed by absorption of packets and discard them or drop the packets. Intrusion Detection System can be used to mitigate and prevent the jamming attack and the addition of cryptographic primitive used to preserve integrity of the packets. This paper proposes a mechanism for preventing jamming attacks on wireless networks-examine the detection efficiency of jamming attack and communication overhead of the wireless network using proactive and reactive protocols. RSA algorithm is used for providing data packets integrity information during wireless transmission. Through simulation and performance analysis, the implemented prevention mechanism and the integrity preservation provides higher packet delivery ratio in proactive routing protocol (OLSR) than reactive routing protocol (AODV).","","978-1-4673-5037-2","","10.1109/ICE-CCN.2013.6528486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528486","jamming attack;proactive routing protocol;reactive routing protocol;wireless network","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Jamming;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","cryptographic protocols;interference suppression;jamming;public key cryptography;radio networks;radiofrequency interference;routing protocols","AODV;OLSR;RSA algorithm;communication overhead;cryptographic primitive;data packet integrity information;denial-of-service attacks;integrity preservation;intentional interference attacks;intrusion detection system;jamming attack detection efficiency;jamming attack mitigation;packet absorption;packet delivery ratio;proactive routing protocol;reactive routing protocol;wireless networks;wireless transmission","","0","","11","","","25-26 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the necessary conditions for achieving the desired high level of resiliency is timely reporting and understanding of the status and behavioral trends of the control system. This paper describes the design and development of a fuzzy-neural data fusion system for increased state-awareness of resilient control systems. The proposed system consists of a dedicated data fusion engine for each component of the control system. Each data fusion engine implements three-layered alarm system consisting of: 1) conventional threshold-based alarms, 2) anomalous behavior detector using self-organizing maps, and 3) prediction error based alarms using neural network based signal forecasting. The proposed system was integrated with a model of the Idaho National Laboratory Hytest facility, which is a testing facility for hybrid energy systems.

To address this problem, we develop a new method of model enforcement based on the JVM tool interface (JVMTI), which introduces few changes to JVM. Since the method keeps compatible with the Java specification requests (JSR), it enjoys a high level of portability.

Since each device in the network has measurement and estimation limitations, more than one device needs to be chosen, and observations can be fused to increase observation accuracy using Dempster-Shafer theory for data fusion. The system decides whether user authentication (or IDS input) is required and which biosensors (or IDSs) should be chosen, depending on the security posture. The decisions are made in a fully distributed manner by each authentication device and IDS.

Clustering techniques had been widely used to cluster the network traffic and to derive rule sets based on the resultant clusters. We propose a parallel clustering technique followed by usage of evolutionary computing comprising of genetic algorithm and Hill climbing to optimize the clusters formed. Rules are generated by analyzing each individual clusters formed. The proposed system was specifically developed with a view to generate rule set for Snort based IDS efficiently. The results show that careful selection of fitness function could improve the efficiency of rule set generated. The computing power offered by grid is used to accomplish the parallel computing task.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing. Experimental results demonstrate the cases in which the performance of AACK is either improved or degraded when the number of MNs changes.","","978-1-4673-6617-5","","10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7149666","","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data","AACK;IDS;MANETs;MNs;NS2;adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile nodes","","0","","15","","","26-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the literature, several solutions have been developed to secure SCADA systems; however; the literature is lacking work directed at the development of tools to evaluate the effectiveness of such solutions. An essential requirement of such tools is the generation of normal and malicious SCADA traffic. In this paper, we present an automated tool to generate a malicious SCADA traffic to be used to evaluate such systems. We consider the traffic generation of the popular SCADA Modbus protocol. The characteristics of the generated traffic are derived from Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS) Modbus rules. The tool uses Scapy to generate packets based on the extracted traffic features. We present the testing results for our tool. The tool is used to read a Snort rule file that contains Modbus rules to extract the required traffic features.","","","","10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923938","Modbus;Network security;SCADA System;Scapy;Snort","Feature extraction;IP networks;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Receivers;SCADA systems","SCADA systems;computer network security;protocols","Modbus traffic generator;NIDS Modbus rules;SCADA Modbus protocol;SCADA systems security evaluation;Scapy;Snort network intrusion detection system;malicious SCADA traffic;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","0","","18","","","23-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS). An implementation of NFEA has been evaluated and the result shows that NFEA is viable to deploy in real networks.","","978-1-4577-0524-3","978-0-7695-4429-8","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952007","DDoS attacks;IP traceback;network forensic;network security;packet marking","Computer crime;Cryptography;Decoding;Encoding;Forensics;IP networks;Radio frequency","Internet;computer forensics;computer network security","AEMS;DDoS attack;Internet crimes;NFEA;TCP/IP based networks;authenticated evidence marking scheme;firewall;flow-based selection marking scheme;intrusion detection system;malicious packet modifications;network forensic evidence acquisition;packet marking","","0","","30","","","26-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is directly related to the quality and level of their teaching and scientific research work. The campus network has a number of tasks such as teaching, research, management and communication with the outside. Therefore, the issue of network security has become a priority to campus network management. Obviously, the current Internet is convenient but at the same time it is unsafe. As part of the Internet and the unique attributes of campus network, it is more easily attacked when enjoying the service provided by the Internet. This paper starts from the current security status of the campus network, analyzing threatens to campus network security and strategies to maintenance of network security, so as to establish a suitable campus network security system, and introduce some current popular campus network information security solutions.","","978-1-4244-7860-6","","10.1109/INDUSIS.2010.5565862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5565862","campus network;firewall;network security;security technology","Databases;Educational institutions;Internet;Monitoring;Security","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","IT technology;Internet;campus network management;campus network security;information security","","1","","9","","","10-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This algorithm logically partition the content of IP packets into three parts and internally uses boyer-moorehorspool algorithm to carry out string-matching simultaneously on these parts. Traditionally, skip based pattern matching algorithms use a single sliding window moving from left to right to detect a pattern to be matched, whereas CSA uses two sliding windows of the pattern simultaneously-one moving towards the right from the start position, towards the middle of the string, and the second starting from the middle and moving towards the end of the string. If both these moving patterns never find a match then CSA evaluates the middle of the string. In this paper, firstly we present our approach and experiments, secondly, we present an extension for Jumbo frames and finally, we present the application of our algorithm for multicore based intrusion detection system.","","978-0-7695-3743-6","","10.1109/CICSYN.2009.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5231952","Content Matching;Intrusion Detection;Multi-Core","Cities and towns;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;string matching","IP packets;Jumbo frames;boyer-moorehorspool algorithm;content-split based effective string-matching;multicore based intrusion detection systems;signature-based network intrusion detection;skip based pattern matching algorithms;sliding windows","","1","","14","","","23-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So far, security and privacy aspects related to the molecular communication systems have not been investigated at all and represent an open question that need to be addressed. The main motivation of this paper lies on providing some first insights about security and privacy aspects of MC systems, by highlighting the open issues and challenges and above all by outlining some specific directions of potential solutions. Existing cryptographic methods and security approaches are not suitable for MC systems since do not consider the pecific issues and challenges, that need ad-hoc solutions. We will discuss directions in terms of potential solutions by trying to highlight the main advantages and potential drawbacks for each direction considered.

As with every emerging infrastructure, the effects of malicious attacks by the adversary class cannot be overlooked. More so if the extent of damage that may be caused through such attacks can affect large user bases of such technology. A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter. In this paper, a collaborative approach towards timely detection of such attacks through pattern reconstruction and verification is proposed. The scheme is capable of detecting anomalous readings within a consumer's household, with minimal communication and processing overhead imposed.","","978-1-4673-0894-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530492","","","Internet;power engineering computing;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Internet;anomalous readings;centralized servers;consumer devices;customer specific data;data aggregators;data concentrators;device implant attack detection;electricity grid;malicious attacks;pattern reconstruction;processing overhead;smart grid infrastructure;smart meters","","0","","15","","","3-5 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we discuss some of the emerging online threats that would likely target systems that facilitate sharing of electronic medical records. We design an enhanced version of the eHealth Exchange with mechanisms to prevent, detect and facilitate investigation of fraudulent medical claims resulting from successful breach of sensitive health data. We also support patient-awareness over how their data is consumed within the distributed network, and augment the accountability present within it. We implement our enhancements within CONNECT, which is an open-source implementation of the eHealth Exchange, and OpenMRS, which is a popular open source electronic medical record system platform.

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high. The analysis in the paper also brings out as to which particular method could be more suitable in a particular scenario and how one can easily get the reduced false positives, which has been a bane of current detection methods. The paper also presents two case scenarios, particularly highlighting the victim Silent case scenario not discussed much thus far in the current literature on the topic, to validate the results. By way of retrospect, an outline of future work is also suggested in the concluding remarks.","","978-1-4799-1605-4","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2013.6719774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719774","802.11 Wireless LAN;FRR;FRR-RA;MAC address;SNRA;Sequence Gap;Spoofing;false positives / negatives;transmission rate;victim Silent case in WLAN","Authentication;Computer crime;Monitoring;Probes;Protocols;Wireless LAN","access protocols;computer network security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN;MAC spoofing detection techniques;WLAN spoofing detection methods;cyber crimes;cyber criminal;denial of service;masquerading attacks;network identifiers;perpetrator-initiator;potent weapon;session hijacking;victim silent case","","0","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs, as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures).Many studies report that IDSs, including signature-based network IDSs, have problems to accurately identify attacks. One possible reason that we observed in our past work, and that is worth investigating further, is that several signatures (i.e., several alarms) can be triggered on the same group of packets, a situation we coined overlapping signatures. This paper presents a technique to precisely and systemat ically quantify the signature overlapping problem of an IDS signature database. The solution we describe is based on set theory and finite state automaton theory, and we experiment with our technique on one widely-used and maintained IDS. Results show that our approach is effective at systematically quantifying the overlap problem in one IDS signature database, and can be potentially used on other IDSs.","1530-0889","978-1-4244-9232-9","978-1-4244-9231-2","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958211","Automaton Theory;Intrusion Detection Signature;Set Theory","Automata;Databases;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Set theory;Systematics","authorisation;digital signatures;finite state machines;set theory","anti-virus systems;computer networks;finite state automaton theory;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;set theory;signature overlaps;signature-based network IDS","","2","","18","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose Adaptive Trust Management Protocol, a protocol that adjusts trust and reputation based on node behavior. The protocol includes three phases: the Learning phase, in which experience is computed based on these alerts received from TinyAFD, the Exchanging phase, in which experience associations are exchanged between neighbor nodes, and the Updating phase, in which trust and reputation are updated based on experience. ATMP has been implemented on top of TinyOS and has been tested using TOSSIM in several attack scenarios to evaluate the evolution of experience, trust and reputation. We performed a comparative evaluation of ATMP with other similar solutions and determined that our protocol covers a larger range of attacks, mostly because of the integration with a complex intrusion detection system.","2068-1038","978-1-4799-2599-5","","10.1109/RoEduNet.2013.6714201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6714201","Wireless Sensor Networks;intrusion detection;reputation;security;trust","Correlation;Detectors;Engines;Monitoring;Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;security of data;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","ATMP;TOSSIM;TinyAFD;TinyOS;adaptive trust management protocol;complex intrusion detection system;exchanging phase;learning phase;malicious attacks;updating phase;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","26-28 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","0","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

In this paper, we identify that there are unique security challenges in a BV's different battery states. Accordingly, we propose a battery status-aware authentication scheme (BASA) to address the issue for V2G networks. In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator. In addition, we perform comprehensive security analysis, which shows that BASA achieves both privacy preservation and security protection during battery state transitions. The analysis also indicates that battery status awareness is crucial for BVs' secure operations for V2G networks in smart grid.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2224387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461499","Authentication;battery status;privacy;security;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Authentication;Batteries;Privacy;Smart grids;Vehicles","automobiles;battery powered vehicles;power engineering computing;smart power grids","BASA;BV;FC-to-discharging phase;V2G networks;battery state transitions;battery status-aware authentication scheme;battery vehicles;challenge-response authentication;data transmission;discharging-to-charging transition;information services;power grid;power services;privacy preservation;security protection;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid","","4","","26","","2013-02-13","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-6442-5","","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture","","2","","21","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322","Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine","Authentication;Databases","data mining;security of data","access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces a novel object-oriented model to represent cases and applies this technology to intrusion detection system (IDS) in order to solve the over-sensitive alarm problem which remains in most of the commercial IDSs. In this model we try to represent the complex case structural information through class hierarchy. The new method not only overcomes limitations that traditional attribute-value case representation can not represent complex cases, but also combines domain knowledge and case representation through constraint rules. In the aspect of case similarity, we divide it into two categories: the intra- class similarity and the inter-class similarity, which shows more accurate and convenient. The object-oriented case representation has been used in our own IDS product and it plays a quite efficient role in mitigating over-sensitive alarm problems.","","978-0-7695-3641-5","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222879","Case-based Reasoning;Intrusion detection;Object oriented case representation","Application software;Computer languages;Encapsulation;Expert systems;Information science;Intrusion detection;Knowledge representation;Object oriented modeling;Psychology;Security","case-based reasoning;knowledge representation;object-oriented programming;security of data","alarm problem;attribute-value case representation;case based reasoning;class hierarchy;constraint rules;domain knowledge;interclass similarity;intraclass similarity;intrusion detection system;object-oriented case representation;object-oriented model;structural information","","1","","17","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Di-Sec: A distributed security framework for heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks","Valero, M.; Sang Shin Jung; Uluagac, A.S.; Yingshu Li; Beyah, R.","Dept. of Comput.

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","6","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GNP is a graph-based evolutionary algorithm and can extract many important class association rules by making use of the distinguished representation ability of the graph structures. In this paper, a probabilistic classification is proposed and combined with the class association rule mining of GNP, and applied to Network intrusion detection for the performance evaluation. The proposed method creates a joint probability density function of normal and intrusion accesses and use it to efficiently classify new access data into normal, known intrusion or unknown intrusion. It is clarified from the experimental results that the proposed method shows high classification accuracy compared to the method without probabilistic classification.","","978-1-4244-6909-3","","10.1109/CEC.2010.5586302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5586302","","Databases;Economic indicators;Genetics;Joints;Probability;Yttrium","Internet;genetic algorithms;security of data;statistical distributions","Internet;class association rule mining;class association rules;computer security;data mining algorithm;genetic network programming;graph structures;graph-based evolutionary algorithm;joint probability density function;multidimensional probability distribution;network intrusion detection;performance evaluation;probabilistic classification","","0","","11","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973690","Anomaly Detection;Clustering;Discrepancy Metric;Information Entropy;k-menas","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information entropy;Measurement;Testing;Training","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DR value;FAR value;IE&FSDM algorithm;KDD CUP1999 dataset;anomaly detection;clustering analysis;frequency sensitive discrepancy metric;information entropy;intrusion detection technology;k-means clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","7-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an innovative distributed architecture for intrusion detection that is able to provide system administrators with selective and early security warnings. This architecture is suitable to large networks composed by several departments because it leverages hierarchical and peer-to-peer cooperation schemes among distributed NIDSes. Moreover, it embeds a distributed alert ranking system that makes it possible to evaluate the real level of risk represented by a security alert generated by a NIDS, and it allows independent network departments to exchange early warnings about critical threats. Thanks to these features, a system administrator can focus on the few alerts that represent a real threat for the controlled infrastructure and can be notified about the most dangerous intrusions before his department is attacked.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578127","Alert ranking;distributed IDS;early warning;intrusion detection systems","Computer architecture;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers;Software","peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","alert management;distributed alert ranking system;distributed intrusion detection architectures;early security warnings;networked information systems complexity;peer-to-peer cooperation schemes;selective security warnings;system administrators;threat detection","","3","","38","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, securing network from inside is necessary, particularly when security hierarchical exist between users. One of the major problems in conducting research on IPv6 security is the absence of a reliable dataset, which is essential in testing and evaluating the proposed solutions. This research develops a reliable dataset of IPv6 NDP by capturing the normal and abnormal behaviors of NDP using specific dependable tools.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","4","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among several evolutionary techniques, Steady State Genetic-based Machine Leaning Algorithm (SSGBML) will be used to detect intrusions with Zeroth Level Classifier system (ZCS) are investigated here. Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations. ZCS is used to play the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether the current message is normal or intrusion and receiving feedback from environment.

The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character. We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168","anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain","Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems","data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics","","0","","28","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this reason, there are needed new systems and models to detect the intrusion in Tor networks. In this paper, we present the application of Neural Networks (NNs) for intrusion detection in Tor networks. We used the Back propagation NN and constructed a Tor server and a Deep Web browser (client). Then, the client sends the data browsing to the Tor server using the Tor network.

Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts. This paper describes a novel forensic hypervisor design that provides coarse-grained process tracking and utilizes next generation Intel virtualization technology, leveraging extended page tables and enforcing MULTICS style protection techniques. Custom forensic introspection techniques are used to walk the extended page tables to inspect a virtual machines state and track the associated processes. A description of the steps necessary to perform tracking are presented; the real-time performance impact is quantified at less than 11μs for each system call.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415817","Forensics;Introspection;Operating Systems;Virtualization","Forensics;Hardware;Kernel;Program processors;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","digital forensics;formal verification;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","MULTICS style protection technique;computing environment;custom forensic introspection;data verification;exploit discovery;forensic hypervisor design;forensic information;interaction history;intrusion;memory;next generation Intel virtualization technology;operating system;page table;process tracking;real-time forensic reconstruction;server;system component;system recovery;virtual machine","","1","","22","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once confined to the network, they are now conducted over the hypercall interface. These attacks are initiated by malicious, unprivileged guests with a goal of incapacitating hosting hypervisors. Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls. The assumption is that exploits will be manifested as previously-unobserved sequences of hypercalls.

Recent malware are not only becoming more sophisticated, but have also demonstrated a trend to make use of components, which can easily be distributed through the Internet to develop newer and better malware. As a result, the key problem facing Cloud security is to cope with identifying diverse sets of malware. This paper presents a method of detecting malware by identifying the symptoms of malicious behaviour as opposed to looking for the malware itself. This can be compared to the use of symptoms in human pathology, in which study of symptoms direct physicians to diagnosis of a disease or possible causes of illnesses. The main advantage of shifting the attention to the symptoms is that a wide range of malicious behaviour can result in the same set of symptoms. We propose the creation of Forensic Virtual Machines (FVM), which are mini Virtual Machines (VM) that can monitor other VMs to discover the symptoms. In this paper, we shall present a framework to support the FVMs so that they collaborate with each other in identifying symptoms by exchanging messages via secure channels. The FVMs report to a Command & Control module that collects and correlates the information so that suitable remedial actions can take place in real-time. The Command & Control can be compared to the physician who infers possibility of an illness from the occurring symptoms. In addition, as FVMs make use of the computational resources of the system we will present an algorithm for sharing of the FVMs so that they can be guided to search for the symptoms in the VMs with higher priority.","1541-7719","978-1-4673-2444-1","","10.1109/EDOC.2012.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337247","Cloud;security;virtualisation","Algorithm design and analysis;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Software;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","FVM;Internet;VM;cloud computing;cloud security;command & control module;forensic virtual machines;human pathology;identifying symptoms;malicious behaviour;malware detection;virtual machines","","5","","19","","","10-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

""Out-of-the-box"" detection, active defense model, or In-VM models have the same defects: (1) on top of the VMM, two virtual machines are used, one by the user (Guest OS) and the other as monitor (Host OS), and (2) users cannot directly view the detection results nor configure detection system in the Guest OS. A layered detection model is proposed to overcome these issues, the bottom layer is responsible for security for the layers above it. Detection results can be directly displayed in the Guest OS, and users can view and configure the detection system. Furthermore, the detection model can isolate malware attacks to the detection system in the Guest OS.

In dynamic and decentralized settings where the traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents. In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics. We apply the results to a class of security games in which the attacker and the defender adopt different learning schemes due to differences in their rationality levels and the information they acquire.","0743-1546","978-1-4244-7745-6","","10.1109/CDC.2010.5718053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718053","","Approximation algorithms;Equations;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Stochastic processes;Trajectory","approximation theory;differential equations;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic games","agent communication;best response dynamics;deterministic ordinary differential equation;fictitious play dynamics;game theory;heterogeneous learning algorithm;incomplete information context;logit dynamics;security games;standard replicator dynamics;stochastic approximation techniques;zero-sum stochastic games","","7","","12","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we are presenting a novel detection of network errors by studying the raw packets of TCP/IP collected in the network. Our aim is to determine various reasons how the abnormal packets appear on the network and also to evaluate, what way such packets can cause actual damage to the network. We study and divide the abnormal packets obtained during our experiments into several categories based on their type and possible related cause. This analysis would hopefully provide a better implementation of security in the way of Intrusion Detection System in the network.","","978-0-7695-3892-1","","10.1109/ICCTD.2009.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359693","INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM;PACKETS;TCP/IP","Computer errors;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protocols;TCPIP;Virtual private networks","internetworking;security of data;transport protocols","TCP/IP packets;computer security;intrusion detection system;network errors detection","","0","","10","","","13-15 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANETS can cooperate for data transfer as well as for communication. Therefore there is no fixed topology for MANETS. Thus MANETS are distributed in nature. The lack of infrastructure makes MANETS more vulnerable for attacks. Networks are protected using many firewalls and encryption software's. In this paper, we propose and implement a secure multicast protocol in intrusion detection systems especially for MANETS. By using this protocol, all the acknowledgement packets are encrypted by using hybrid cryptography. Using this cryptography, unwanted network overhead will be reduced. Thus network performance of MANETS will be improved.

Applications include network modeling and simulation, identification of security attacks, and validation of research results. Unfortunately, network flows carry extremely sensitive information, and this discourages the publication of those datasets. Indeed, existing techniques for network flow sanitization are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, and solutions proposed for microdata anonymity cannot be directly applied to network traces. In our previous research, we proposed an obfuscation technique for network flows, providing formal confidentiality guarantees under realistic assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. In this paper, we identify the threats posed by the incremental release of network flows, we propose a novel defense algorithm, and we formally prove the achieved confidentiality guarantees. An extensive experimental evaluation of the algorithm for incremental obfuscation, carried out with billions of real Internet flows, shows that our obfuscation technique preserves the utility of flows for network traffic analysis.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6774971","Data sharing;network flow analysis;privacy;security","Data privacy;Encryption;IP networks;Knowledge engineering;Privacy;Uncertainty","Internet;security of data","Internet;adversary knowledge;datasets;microdata anonymity;network flows incremental release;network traces;network traffic analysis;obfuscation technique;real network flows;research community;security attacks;sensitive data obfuscation","","1","","32","","2014-03-18","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Improving network management with software defined networking","Hyojoon Kim; Feamster, N.","","Communications Magazine, IEEE","20130214","2013","51","2","114","119","Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how SDN can improve common network management tasks.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461195","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Control systems;Home automation;Logic gates;Software radio;Telecommunication network management","computer network management;high level languages;telecommunication security","SDN;complex high-level network policy;high-level policy language;logically centralized software program;low-level vendor-specific configuration;network management;packet forwarding device;secure communication;software defined networking;stop-gap solution","","66","1","","","","February 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
