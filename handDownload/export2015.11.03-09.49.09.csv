Due to increasing number of Advanced Persistent Attacks such as malware, rootkit, spyware etc., virtual machine protection is highly challenging task. The key element of Advanced Persistent Threat is rootkit that provides stealthy control of underlining Operating System (kernel). Protecting individual guest operating system by using antivirus and commercial security defense mechanism is cost effective and ineffective for virtualized environment. To solve this problem, Virtual Machine Introspection has emerged as one of the promising approaches to secure the state of the virtual machine. Virtual Machine Introspection inspects the state of multiple virtual machines by operating outside the virtual machine i.e. at hypervisor level. In this work, Virtual Machine Introspection based malicious process detection approach is proposed. It extracts the high level information such as system call details, opened known backdoor ports from introspected memory to identify the spurious process. It triggers an alert in response to detected intrusion.","","978-1-4799-8432-9","","10.1109/ABLAZE.2015.7155003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155003","Hypervisor;Rootkit;Semantic Gap;Virtual Machine;Virtual Machine Introspection;Virtualization","Kernel;Malware;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtualisation","advanced persistent attacks;advanced persistent threat;antivirus;backdoor port;guest operating system protection;high level information;hypervisor level;intrusion detection;malicious process detection approach;malware;memory introspection;rootkit;security defense mechanism;spurious process detection;spyware;state inspection;stealthy control;system call details;underlining operating system kernel;virtual machine introspection;virtual machine protection;virtual machine state security;virtualized cloud computing environment;vulnerability exploitation","","0","","27","","","25-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate. Thus it proves the validity of the new algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4638-4","978-1-4244-4639-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5302607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302607","","Biological neural networks;Computer network management;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Helium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Transfer functions","genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data","GA-based WWN intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;identification rate;network running efficiency;network security;wavelet neural network","","0","","13","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rapid growth of web sites and web applications gives way to deliver complex business applications through the web. As the web dependency increases, so do the web hacking activities. Web applications are normally written in scripting languages like JavaScript, PHP embedded in HTML allowing connectivity to the databases, retrieving data and putting them in the WWW site. A web application is vulnerable to many kinds of threats and attacks. In order to detect known attacks, some set of attack rules and detections are needed. In this paper, a negative security model based on misuse of web applications is used. This negative security model provides a Web Application Firewall(WAF) engine with a rule set, to ensure critical protection across every web architecture. WAFs are deployed to establish an increased external security layer to detect and/or prevent attacks before they reach web applications. This paper has been tested with apache web server's log file. We have tested successfully almost all the common attacks. This paper also allows for HTTP traffic monitoring and real-time analysis with little or no changes to existing infrastructure.","","978-1-4244-7817-0","","10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5643461","Web intrusion;attacker;cross-site scripting;logging;rule set;sql injection;web application firewall","Computer hacking;Databases;Fires;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Web server","Internet;authoring languages;computer crime;computer network security;ethical aspects;hypermedia;information retrieval","HTTP traffic monitoring;WWW;Web application firewall;Web server log profile;Web sites;anomaly detection;data retrieval;ethical hackers;hacking;negative security model;real-time analysis;scripting languages;threats;unethical hackers","","1","","11","","","8-10 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, as the VMs from different customers are running on the same host, an attack to the management virtual machine will easily lead to the compromise of the guest VMs. Therefore, it is critical for a cloud computing system to ensure the trustworthiness of management VMs. To this end, we propose VMGuard, an integrity monitoring and detecting system for management virtual machines in a distributed environment. VMGuard utilizes a special VM, Guard Domain, which runs on each physical node to monitor the co-resident management VMs. The integrity measurements collected by the Guard Domains are sent to the VMGuard server for safe store and independent analysis. The experimental evaluation of a Xen-based prototype shows that VMGuard can quickly detect the root kit attacks while the performance overhead is low.","1521-9097","978-1-4244-9727-0","978-0-7695-4307-9","10.1109/ICPADS.2010.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695587","Integrity Monitoring;Remote I/O;Virtual Machine","","cloud computing;system monitoring;virtual machines","VMGuard server;cloud computing provider;cloud computing system;cloud providers;coresident management;detecting system;distributed environment;guard domain;independent analysis;integrity monitoring system;management virtual machine;virtual machines","","5","","25","","","8-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6449406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services","","","","4","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts. Besides that, a optimizer called Firefly Algorithm was also used to enhance the results by optimizing both Apriori and SOM parameters and a comparative study was performed on both optimized and non-optimized models. The OHM showed to be superior to a non-optimized model for both eMule and Skype applications, reaching levels superior to 94% for correctness rate. The OHM was also validated against another model based on computational intelligence, named Realtime, and the OHM proposed in this work presented better results when tested in real time.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755057","Association Rules;Firefly Algorithm;Network Traffic Measurement;Self-Organizing Maps","Association rules;Computational modeling;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems;Training","Internet;computer network management;cryptography;data mining;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;self-organising feature maps","Apriori;DPI;Internet;OHM;Realtime computational intelligence;SOM;Skype;association rules;deep packet inspection;eMule;encrypted data;firefly algorithm;hybrid model;network traffic classification;network traffic identification;optimized hybrid model;port-based inspection;rule-based model;self-organizing map;traffic volume","","1","","24","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed.

Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT.

In this paper GA has been used to simultaneously select significant features as input to ANN and automatically determine the optimal number of hidden node. Meanwhile the ANN training is done by Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm. A new procedure in obtaining optimal ANN architecture is also described which based on feature importance determine by Genetic Algorithm.

However, they tend to show good performance on off-line data and their accuracy drop when they are deployed to realtime intrusion detection systems that receive data streams constantly. In other words, the problem with a conventional classifier model, when applied to realtime detection systems, is that it is likely to perform poorly against new data that is different from the patterns against which the model was trained. This work presents an adaptive classification framework for a realtime intrusion detection system that changes its behavior according to the patterns occurred in the new received data. The performance of the system is constantly monitored and whenever it drops under a certain level of accuracy, the classifier model is retrained to learn new patterns and eliminate the obsolete ones from its knowledge. Further, the framework uses a semi rule-based approach to classification in order to make the model more understandable for human experts and facilitate the user interference in the learning process.","","978-1-4673-1420-6","","10.1109/CYBER.2012.6392538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392538","","Accuracy;Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;user interfaces","adaptive classification framework;classification algorithm;classifier model;cyberinfrastructure;cybersecurity;data mining method;incremental semi rule-based learning model;realtime intrusion detection system;user interference","","0","","13","","","27-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, it is very difficult to find a real origin of attackers because DoS/DDoS attacker uses spoofed IP addresses. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic route selection algorithm to trace the attacker's real origin. This algorithm uses three types of packets such as an alert packet, an agent packet and a reply agent packet. The alert packet is in use to notify to a victim that DDoS attacks occur. The agent packet is in use to find the attacker's real origin and the reply agent packet is in use to notify to a victim that the agent packet is reached the edge router of the attacker. When source-end detector and victim-end detector detect attacks, the victim-end detector sends the alert packet to the victim. The victim received the alert packet generates the agent packet and sends it to a victim's edge router. The attacker's edge router received the agent packet generates the reply agent packet and send it to the victim. The agent packet and the reply agent packet is forwarded refer to probabilistic packet forwarding table by routers. The probabilistic route selection algorithm runs on the distributed routers and probabilistic packet forwarding table is stored and managed by routers. We simulate for the propose of validation this algorithm by using OPNET14.0 in terms of false positive and required number of packets to trace DDoS attack traffic source.","","978-1-4244-9222-0","978-1-4244-9223-7","10.1109/ICISA.2011.5772420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772420","","Computer crime;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Logic gates;Probabilistic logic;Watermarking","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;probability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack traffic source;DoS attack;Internet;OPNET14.0;agent packet;alert packet;distributed denial of service;probabilistic packet forwarding;probabilistic route selection algorithm;reply agent packet;source-end detector;spoofed IP addresses;victim-end detector","","0","","7","","","26-29 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There have been many significant advances on security threats and countermeasures in CRNs in the past few years. Our main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for CRN security to protect both unlicensed secondary users and licensed primary users. Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables.

This paper deals with design consideration of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on the Hadoop framework and acceleration of its performance by using General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU). The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings. Analytics over intrusion is done by using a Score-Weight approach called as Pattern Frequency Inverse Cluster Frequency (PF-ICF). The design consideration of accelerated NIDS is a solution towards the performance issues of various NIDS that faces due to the large volumes of the network traffic.","","","","10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087201","CUDA;GPGPU;Hadoop;NIDS;Network Security","Algorithm design and analysis;Ecosystems;Graphics processing units;Intrusion detection;Servers;Telecommunication traffic","data analysis;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming;security of data","CUDA;Compute Unified Device Architecture;Flume;GPGPU;HBase;Hadoop framework;Hive;NIDS;NVidia;PF-ICF;Pig;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion pattern analytics;log files;network intrusion detection system;network security policy;network traffic;parallel programming model;pattern frequency inverse cluster frequency;score-weight approach;streaming data handling","","0","","15","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers. We carried out theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard for discovery, blocking, and traceback of malicious traffic.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2465934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182328","Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Traffic;Tor;intrusion detection system;malicious traffic","Bandwidth;Law;Logic gates;Malware;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;digital forensics;invasive software;law;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","IDS alerts;P2P traffic;Tor exit routers;TorWard;administrative complaints;botnet traffic;denial-of-service attack traffic;dual-tone multifrequency signaling-based approach;forensic traceback;intrusion detection system;legal complaints;low-latency anonymous communication system;malicious traffic traceback;malware traffic;spam;suspect connections;university campus","","0","","55","","2015-08-07","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Generally, these mechanisms overwhelmingly describe and record patterns of suspicious packets as alerts in the form of intrusion logs. Thereafter, analysts must subsequently validate the content of each intrusion log to ascertain the validity of each alert. Secondly, high level of expertise is required to discern each alert. However, more time and resources are unduly spent at the expense of countermeasures that ought to be proactively initiated to thwart attacks in progress. Accordingly, TSA-Log analyzer that uses a computationally fast technique and a uniform baseline to determine patterns of intrusions is proposed in this paper. Validations that are carried out on five publicly available datasets demonstrate that propagation strategies of intrusions, efficient countermeasures and the extent of similarity of intrusions can be forecasted giving the knowledge of the patterns of alerts in intrusion logs.","","978-1-4673-0687-4","","10.1109/CIS.2011.6169144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169144","Alert;intrusion;intrusion detection system;patterns of intrusions;time series analysis;timestamp","Computer networks;Computers;Conferences;Cybernetics;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Time series analysis","forecasting theory;security of data;time series","TSA-log analyzer;computer system threats;electronic evidence monitoring;intrusion detection system;intrusion logs;network intrusion forecasting;thwart attacks;time series analysis","","0","","19","","","1-2 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET.

This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2050685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499108","Class-association-rule mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection","Data mining;Databases;Economic indicators;Fuzzy set theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Web and internet services","data mining;directed graphs;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;security of data","directed graph structures;fuzzy class-association-rule mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic network programming;intrusion-detection model","","20","","33","","2010-07-01","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452","Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation","Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology","","","","0","","","","","August 2015","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Using Resource Based View (RBV) as a theoretical base and linking it with the role of CIOs, we determine through twin generalized linear squares (GLS) regression models that a CIO indeed does have a significant impact at the macro- and micro- levels on firm performance. In this study, Tobin's q is used as an indicator of firm performance in the context of IT security breach for the first time in IS. Our results have implications for both the practitioner and the academic, such as positive influences of CIOs, and an alternate strategy for computing firm performance respectively.

From a law enforcement and forensic investigation perspective, cloud computing can be thought of as a double edged sword. While on one hand, the gathering of digital evidence from cloud sources can bring with it complicated technical and cross-jurisdictional legal challenges. On the other, the employment of cloud storage and processing capabilities can expedite the forensics process and focus the investigation onto pertinent data earlier in an investigation. This paper examines the state-of-the-art in cloud-focused, digital forensic practises for the collection and analysis of evidence and an overview of the potential use of cloud technologies to provide Digital Forensics as a Service.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2015.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299965","Cloud Computing;Cloud Forensics;Cybercrime Investigation;Digital Forensics","Cloud computing;Forensics;NIST;Security;Servers","","","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose an IDS model which includes two stages: feature selection with information gain and detection with Support Vector Machines (SVM). A draw-back of SVM is that its performance results are influenced by its user input parameters. Therefore, in order to better the classifier we exploit the advantages of a recent Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithm, the Bat Algorithm (BA), which we improve by enhancing its randomization with Lévy flights. We test our model for the NSL-KDD dataset and prove that it can outperform the original BA, ABC or the popular PSO.","","978-1-4799-1779-2","","10.1109/CSCS.2015.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7168448","Bat Algorithm;IDS;L??vy flights;SVM","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Silicon;Support vector machines","feature selection;optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","BA;IDS model;Lévy flights;NSL-KDD dataset;SI algorithm;SVM;anomaly intrusion detection systems;attack type identification;data volumes;feature selection;improved bat algorithm;information gain;support vector machines;swarm intelligence algorithm","","0","","21","","","27-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A FCM for a dynamic system is a signed graph consisted of relevant concepts and causal relationships/weights between the concepts in the system. With suitable weights defined by experts in the related areas, the inference of the FCM can provide meaningful modeling of the system. Thus correctness of the weights is crucial to the success of a FCM system. Normally the weights are set by experts in the related areas. Considering the possible inefficiency and subjectivity of experts when judging the weights, it is an appealing idea to generate weights automatically according to the samples obtained through observation of the system. Some training algorithms were proposed. However, to our best knowledge, few learning algorithm has been reported to generate weight matrix based on sample sequences with continuous values. In this paper, we introduce a new learning algorithm to train the weights of FCM. In the proposed algorithm, the weights are updated by gradient descent on a squared Bellman residual, which is an accepted method in machine learning. The experiment results show that given sufficient training samples, the correct weights can be approximated by the algorithm. The algorithm proposes a new way for FCM research and applications.","1098-7584","978-1-4244-7315-1","978-1-4244-7316-8","10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007485","Fuzzy cognitive maps","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Training","cognitive systems;fuzzy set theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence)","FCM inference;FCM system;dynamic system;fuzzy cognitive map;gradient descent;gradient residual algorithm;learning algorithm;machine learning;signed graph;squared Bellman residual;system modeling;weight matrix","","0","","19","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a cyber security incident occurs, the critical question that security administrators are concerned about is: What has happened? Cyber situation assessment is critical to making correct and timely defense decisions by the analysts. STIX ontology, which was developed by taking advantage of existing cyber security related standards, is used to represent cyber threat information and infer important features of the cyber situation that help decision makers form their situational awareness. However, due to the widespread application of information technology, security analysts face a challenge in information overload. There are still huge volumes of low level observations captured by various sensors and network tools that need to be used to derive the high level intelligence queries such as potential courses of action and future impact. Therefore, identification of the relevant cyber threat information for a specific query is a crucial procedure for cyber situation assessment. In this paper, we leverage the STIX ontology to represent cyber threat information in a logical framework. In order to recognize specific situation types and identify the minimal and sufficient information for answering a query automatically, we propose an information relevance reasoning mechanism based on situation theory.

These signatures are not descriptions of exploits, but instead are descriptions of the program conditions that lead to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, i.e., they depend on the structure of the vulnerabilities themselves. A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching. To evaluate our technique, we implemented it for Java programs and applied it on Tomcat 3.0 in order to detect well-known attacks.

We give its related definitions, design and critical functional components that emulate different lymphocytes and fleeting contacts between them, and finally it shows many unique properties in ecological organization evolution process, such as high degree of autonomy, distribution, evolution, and scalability and so on.","","978-0-7695-3744-3","","10.1109/IAS.2009.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284195","artificial ecosystem;immune system;mobile agent;network security","Biological system modeling;Computer architecture;Computer security;Data security;Ecosystems;Immune system;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Technology management","computer networks;mobile agents;telecommunication security","artificial ecosystem;eco-defending architecture;ecological organization evolution process;immunity system;mobile agent;network security","","0","","17","","","18-20 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and difference distance map are used for selection of significant features. This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain. The similarity between new incoming packets and a normal profile is determined using Euclidean distance on the simple, low-dimensional feature domain.

In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for Web browsing. When applied to real Web browsing traffic, the algorithms were able to discount 98.5% of measured bytes and effectively isolate information leaks.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3633-0","","10.1109/SP.2009.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207641","Forensics;HTTP;Information Leaks;Intrusion Detection;Web Traffic","Bandwidth;Cryptography;IP networks;Inspection;Internet;Network servers;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Volume measurement","Internet;hypermedia;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;data loss prevention systems;hypertext transfer protocol;information leaks;network bandwidth;network traffic;outbound Web browsing traffic;protocol specifications","","12","1","27","","","17-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without that understanding, data publishers are left to wonder what fields must be anonymized to avoid legal fallout, while researchers question the confidence of results gained from the data. However, the extensive work done on micro- data anonymity provides the network research community with several useful insights about how to effectively apply anonymization to published data. At the same time, prior wisdom cannot be applied directly without first overcoming several challenges, including the development of appropriate privacy and utility definitions for the more complex case of network data.

We construct optimal attack schedules to maximize the expected average estimation error at the remote estimator. We also provide the optimal attack schedules when a special intrusion detection system (IDS) at the estimator is given.

From the definition of DDoS, thousands of network attacks must initiate simultaneously and continuously to achieve a successful DDoS attacking. Therefore, almost all of the information system cannot survive as they confront the DDoS attacks. Although there are a lot of intrusion detection system (IDS) developed, preventing DDoS attack is still difficult and perplexing. In this paper, an early warning system for detecting DDoS attacking has been mounted to a traditional IDS to form a completely system. This early warning system is developed based on the rationale of time delay neural network. In the networking topology, each node is monitored with the deployment of detectors to establish a multilayer architecture. In addition, the activities of each node will be monitored by their neighboring nodes to check whether it is still survival or not mutually. After then, all of the attacking information will be collected and transferred to the expert module for integrating analysis. As those nodes dispatched on the DMZ or between the first and second layer of firewall face some attacking similar as the pattern of DDoS, the kernel expert module which dispatched behind the second firewall will take some feasible actions and initiate the defense strategies to protect the kernel information system. In the meanwhile, those failed nodes will be restarted and act as the role of vanguard to assure the networking under normal operation.","","978-1-4244-8378-5","978-0-7695-4222-5","10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636160","Denial of service;Distributed denial of service;Information security;Internet hacking;Time-delay neural network","Alarm systems;Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Nonhomogeneous media;Servers","computer network security;delays;network topology;neural nets;safety systems","DDoS attack;distributed denial of service;early warning system;information security;intrusion detection system;multilayer deployment;network attack techniques;networking topology;time delay neural network","","0","","7","","","15-17 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value.

One implication of the existence of different hierarchical levels in CGs is that it imposes different access and usage policies on resources. In this paper we firstly highlight the most common Grid users types and their relationships and access scenarios in CGs corresponded to old (e.g. performance) and new (e.g security) requirements. Then, we identify and analyze new features arising in users' behavior in Grid scheduling, such as dynamic, selfish, cooperative, trustful, symmetric and asymmetric behaviors. We discuss also how computational economy-based approaches, such as market mechanisms, and computational paradigms, such as Neural Networks, can be used to model user requirements and predict users' behaviors in CGs.

Nodes can change position quite frequently, which mean the mobility of the network. For quick data transmission, we need a routing protocol that adapts to topology changes. For our convenience, we have proposed a fast and secure protocol which is proactive and reactive in nature. In proactive protocol, routing table updates takes place when the topology changes. In routers that use dynamic routing protocols, it is important to have fast convergence because routers could make incorrect forwarding decisions until the network has fully converged. In proactive protocol, when a new node is added in the network it takes some time to converge during that time if we want to send data to destination through that new node immediately, it takes some time to converge and then it will transmit the data. To avoid this problem we are going to use reactive protocol instead of proactive in that time that is until network converge. In proactive protocol structure, we reduced the packet size and contains only limited field. By this, the total bit size gets reduced. We propose this mechanism to avoid waiting time and to transmit data as early as possible. Also we propose a security mechanism for detecting malicious node by using central agent and process algorithm.

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710","Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching","Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security","buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching","AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection","","0","","12","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, they are used to instrument the web application at source code level, so that a deviation from the normal profile can be detected at run-time. This paper illustrates on simple examples how the approach detects well known categories of web attacks that involve a state violation of the application, such as SQL injections.

In RAIM, the concepts and formal definitions of antigen, antibody, and memory cells in the network security domain are given, the dynamic clonal principle of antibody is integrated, the mechanism of immune vaccination is discussed, and the dynamic evolvement formulations of detection profiles are established (including the detection profiles' dynamic generation and extinction, dynamic learning, dynamic transformation, and dynamic self-organization), which will accomplish that the detection profiles dynamically synchronize with the real network environment.

E-STAR combines payment and trust systems with a trust-based and energy-aware routing protocol. The payment system rewards the nodes that relay others' packets and charges those that send packets. The trust system evaluates the nodes' competence and reliability in relaying packets in terms of multi-dimensional trust values. The trust values are attached to the nodes' public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions. We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss of trust will result in loss of future earnings. Moreover, for the efficient implementation of the trust system, the trust values are computed by processing the payment receipts. Analytical results demonstrate that E-STAR can secure the payment and trust calculation without false accusations. Simulation results demonstrate that our routing protocols can improve the packet delivery ratio and route stability.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519238","Securing heterogeneous multihop wireless networks;and secure routing protocols;packet dropping and selfishness attacks;trust systems","","radio networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","E-STAR;energy capability;energy-aware routing protocol;heterogeneous multihop wireless networks;multidimensional trust values;node public-key certificates;payment system;reliable routing protocols;route stability;routing decisions;secure routing protocols;trust systems;trust-based routing protocol","","0","","25","","2013-05-23","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.","","978-1-4799-3078-4","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318","Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security","computer network security","OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks","","0","","17","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the remote sensing image data's usage rate still remains very low. To solve this problem, we propose a new Service model: Anytime-Anywhere Service (AAService) model, under which users can get remote sensing images anytime and anywhere. Then we implemented and tested our AA-Service System based on this Service model. First of all, we introduced the framework of the AA-Service System. The AAService System includes three units: Data Center, Communication Unit, and User Unit; and provides three kinds of Services: image Service, plotting Service, and update Service. The features of the AA-Service are seamless coverage, all online Service, and efficient distribution. Secondly, we also described the three key technologies of the AA-Service System in this paper: distributing data according to the users' needs, updating remote sensing image partially and transmitting data in an efficient way. In the AA-Service System, the remote sensing image is organized by the global subdivision compression pyramid which enables the System to distribute remote sensing images of different resolution to users according to the users' requests. When the remote sensing image is changing, the System only updates the changed area rather than the whole image. This is different from other image Service models which distribute remote sensing images by scene or map sheet. In addition, this System ensures reliable and efficient data transmission by integrating three communication methods: BeiDou communication, CDMA communication and Internet communication, and using a new packet loss retransmission mechanism. Thirdly, we listed the statistics data of the System test. In the System test, we measured the Qos and consumed time of image Service, plotting Service and update Service respectively. The results show that this AA-Service System can provide the remote sen- - sing images Service anytime and anywhere in a short time and in a good Qos. By using this AA-Service System, the remote sensing image data's usage rate will be increased and users can experience more convenient remote sensing images Service in their daily life.","","978-1-4244-7301-4","","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567681","AA-Service;Global Subdivision Compression Pyramid;Packet loss retransmission Mechanism;Partial-Image Updates;remote sensing images","Computational modeling;Data models;Databases;Image resolution;Internet;Receivers;Remote sensing","Internet;code division multiple access;data communication;geographic information systems;image processing;quality of service;remote sensing;statistical analysis","AA-Service system;AAService model;BeiDou communication;CDMA communication;Internet communication;QoS;all online service;anytime-anywhere-service system;communication unit;data center;data transmission;global subdivision compression pyramid;image service;packet loss retransmission mechanism;plotting service;remote sensing image data;remote sensing technology;seamless coverage;statistics data;update service;user unit","","0","","12","","","18-20 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes.

Studying attacks in a real environment however, is not viable and therefore it is necessary to find other methods how to examine the nature of attacks. Gaining detailed knowledge about them facilitates designing of new detection methods as well as understanding their impact. In this paper we present a testbed framework to simulate attacks that enables to study a wide range of security scenarios. The framework provides a notion of real-world arrangements, yet it retains full control over all the activities performed within the simulated infrastructures. Utilizing the sandbox environment, it is possible to simulate various security attacks and evaluate their impacts on real infrastructures. The design of the framework benefits from IaaS clouds. Therefore its deployment does not require dedicated facilities and the testbed can be deployed over miscellaneous contemporary clouds. The viability of the testbed has been verified by a simulation of particular DDoS attack.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838298","","Cybernetics;Local area networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Probes;Web servers","cloud computing;security of data","DDoS attack;IaaS cloud;cloud-based testbed;cyber attacks simulation;distributed denial-of-service;infrastructure-as-a-service;sandbox environment;security scenarios","","1","","19","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce the concept of credit-based networking - borrowing ideas from financial management and adapting them to network management. We first focus on a campus network by studying concrete scenarios of how credit-based network management can be applied. We then discuss how the concept is generally applicable to managing network behaviors as well by applying it to managing ISP peering relationships. We argue that the cascading effect of credit-based network management can enhance network management efficiency and improve the global network environment we all live in.","","978-1-4244-2912-7","978-1-4244-2913-4","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808889","","Computer network management;Concrete;Environmental management;Financial management","computer network management;security of data;telecommunication security","ISP peering relationships;cascading effect;computer network administrator;credit based networking;credit-based network management;financial management;global network environment;malicious users;network management efficiency;user behavioral problems","","0","","10","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This mimicry traffic is potentially neglected by detectors. In this paper, we propose a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based method for detecting anomalous traffic mimicking legitimate traffic. Our method firstly observes the port pair distribution of traffic flows, which is a novel statistical traffic feature proposed in this work. Secondly, our method computes the KL divergence between the port pair distributions of the current and previous time intervals. Our method starts to find anomalous flows when the KL divergence deviates from a specified threshold. We tested the performance of our method with traffic which was mixed by four synthetic mimicry anomalies and real-world backbone traffic. The results indicated that our method could precisely detect all synthetic anomalies. Furthermore, our method additionally revealed six real-world anomalies that were hidden in the testing backbone traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238570","Kullback-Leibler divergence;Statistical anomaly detection;distance measure;mimicry anomaly;statistical traffic feature","Ash;Computer crime;Detectors;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Ports (Computers)","security of data;telecommunication traffic","HTTP;KL divergence-based method;Kullback-Leibler divergence;anomalous traffic;legitimate traffic;network-based mimicry anomaly detection;port pair distribution;real-world backbone traffic;statistical traffic feature;synthetic mimicry anomalies;time intervals","","0","","","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel NSSA framework is presented. The framework includes two parts: calculate the Network Security Situation Value (NSSV) and discover intrusion processes. NSSA quantitative assesses the impact on network security caused by attacks upon Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and hierarchical network structure. Based on attack classification, intrusion processes discover the process how network security is affected. At last from the experiments results, NSSV exactly changes as attacks take place and the accurate intrusion processes are discovered.

Impact analysis is then performed through co-simulation of automation and the electric grid to assess the potential damage from the attacks. This paper makes an extensive review of vulnerability and impact analysis methods and relevant system modeling techniques from the fields of security and industrial automation engineering, with a focus on smart grid automation, and then applies and combines approaches to obtain a security risk analysis methodology.

Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the “normal behavior DNA sequence” through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed.
