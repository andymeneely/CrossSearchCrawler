However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host. In addition, we showed that MapReduce-based programs complete the flow analysis job against a single node failure.","","978-1-4244-6037-3","","10.1109/NOMSW.2010.5486551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486551","Hadoop;MapReduce;NetFlow;cloud computing;traffic monitoring","Cloud computing;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Statistical distributions;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;network servers;parallel processing;public domain software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Hadoop;Internet flow analysis method;Internet traffic measurement;MapReduce software framework;cloud computing platform;cluster filesystem;coarse traffic statistics;distributed parallel processing schemes;flow aggregation;flow statistics;flow traces;high performance server;open-source MapReduce system;packet sampling;packet traces;traffic data monitoring","","23","","15","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the industry wide adaptation of service-oriented architecture (SOA), web services have become an integral component of enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges. Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant. In this paper we provide an overview of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis techniques to discover these vulnerabilities. The paper reviews the security issues targeting web services, software/program verification and security development lifecycle.","","978-1-4799-1736-5","","10.1109/THS.2015.7225337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225337","Cyber Security;Penetration Testing;RESTFul API;SOA;SOAP;Secure Design;Secure Software Development;Security Code Review;Service Oriented Architecture;Source Code Analysis;Static Analysis Tool;Static Code Analysis;Web Application security;Web Services;Web Services Security","Computer crime;Cryptography;Simple object access protocol;Testing;XML","Web services;program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","Heartbleed;Internet of Things;Internet scale;OWASP;Open Web Application Security Project;RESTFul services;SOAP centric standards;Shellshock;WS-SecureConversation;WS-security;Web applications;Web service security;Web services guidelines;XML encryption;XML signature;critical national infrastructure;dynamic analysis;enterprise software ecosystem;information exchange;mission critical API;mobile applications;national security and industry;program verification;public deployments;public sector infrastructure;risk assessment;secure development life cycle;security challenges;service development paradigm;service-oriented architecture;services security;software bugs;software verification;static code analysis;strategic components;ubiquitous IoT;vulnerabilities detection;vulnerability identification","","0","","23","","","14-16 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections. Finally, we compare the alerts produced by different malware families and highlight key differences in their volume, aliveness, fanout, and severity.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901257","Intrusion detection;alert correlation;malware;malware measurements;snort","Grippers;Image edge detection;Monitoring;Servers;Trojan horses","invasive software","EDGe;ETH Zurich campus network;IDS alert correlation;Snort IDS;extrusion detection guard;intrusion detection systems;malware","","0","","36","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This improves network visibility and control thereby reducing vendor dependency. OpenFlow protocol provides a standardized approach to realize these goals of SDN. In this paper, we illustrate our progress with a Software-defined Cloud-Gateway automation system using OpenFlow. In addition, based on our deployment experience, we highlight two technical challenges when using OpenFlow. First, with the standardization being an evolving effort, we highlight some of the programming challenges and missing features within the OpenFlow protocol. Secondly, existing OpenFlow-based network stack lacks some architectural components that reduces the level of flexibility we achieve when programming the network. Most SDN controllers expose limited abstractions to build network applications thereby primarily functioning as an OpenFlow driver. This imposes an application programmer to work with several OpenFlow primitives. To address this problem, we elaborate our current work in extending the SDN stack to improve our overall network programmability experience.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2013.6710582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710582","Cloud Networking;Network Programmability;OpenFlow;Service Provider;Software-defined Networks;VPN","Libraries;Logic gates;Programming;Quality of service;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;internetworking;protocols","OpenFlow driver;OpenFlow protocol;SDN controllers;network visibility;overall network programmability experience;software defined cloud-gateway automation system;software-defined networks;vendor dependency","","1","","27","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the widely used technique for anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDS) is cluster analysis. In cluster based IDS, feature vectors generated from network traffic are grouped into clusters as normal or abnormal (raising alert). The main cause for false alert generation is either, technique fails to differentiate an outlier from a genuine cluster point or the features extracted fail to separate the two classes. In this work, fuzzy clustering technique for anomaly intrusion detection has been explored to reduce the false alarms.

Due to special characteristics of these networks, security issue is a difficult task to achieve. Hence, applying current intrusion detection techniques developed for fixed networks is not sufficient for MANETs. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole. Experimental results show that GAAIS is more efficient in comparison with similar approaches.","","978-1-4799-3350-1","","10.1109/IranianCIS.2014.6802607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802607","Ad hoc network;Artificial immune system;Genetic algorithm;Intrusion detection;Routing attack","Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Vectors","artificial immune systems;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AIS;AODV-based MANET;GA;NS2 simulator;NicheMGA algorithm;artificial immune system;blackhole simulator;dynamic intrusion detection technique;flooding simulator;genetic algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor simulator;network topology;network traffic;normal feature vector extraction;routing attack simulation;rushing simulator;security;spherical detector;wireless mobile node;wormhole simulator","","0","","13","","","4-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Organization cannot afford any kinds of attacks on their confidential information and resources either from insiders or out-siders. The damage done by insiders is more severe than that of external attackers due to their knowledge about the system and potential targets. It has been observed by studying previous case studies of insider attacks that insiders usually get involve in some unusual or suspicious activities prior to launching actual attacks. So observing these kinds of activities and taking proper actions in time may help to avoid such kinds of attacks. In this paper a risk assessment methodology has been presented to compute the threat levels of insiders. Appropriate actions may be taken by knowing about the threat level of each user in order to avoid actual attacks. The methodology not only incorporates technical measures but also some psychological indicators to detect insiders. The difference of this methodology from the previous ones is that it provides a practical way of quantization of risks for insider threats. The methodology is simulated in a test network against different scenarios and results showed that it efficiently categorized users according to their threat level. So it provides a base to deploy non uniform security policies among the users thus reducing overall processing overheads.","","978-1-4799-7504-4","","10.1109/FIT.2014.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118395","Insider;Organization;Risk;psychological;threat","Computers;Distance measurement;Monitoring;Organizations;Psychology;Security;Software","psychology;security of data","information misuse;insider threat;nonuniform security policy;psychological indicator;risk assessment","","0","","13","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With booming number of intruders and hackers in todays vast and sophisticated computerized world, it is unceasingly challenging to identify unknown attacks in promising time with no false positive and no false negative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization.

This paper propose an agent-based multicast routing scheme like On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) which can be more suitable for Ad Hoc network but D-ODMRP Destination driven On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol is used to reduce the number of nodes to be added in the forwarding group. D-ODMRP introduces the features into the existing on demand process of multicast forwarding structure in MANET that builds a backbone in the form of a reliable mesh and finds multicast routes.

IoT can be considered as the set of technologies that allow small devices e.g. sensors, which constitute wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that perform specific tasks, to communicate over the Internet Protocol (IP). Cellular networks, especially LTE, are an attractive technology to provide Internet connectivity to these potentially remote devices. In order to allow the cellular networks to connect these devices reliably to the Internet, the traffic of WSNs should be studied to understand their unique requirements on the cellular infrastructure. This is because the existing cellular networks have been traditionally designed mainly to support human to human communication in which case the traffic is completely different than that of WSNs. This paper aims to shed some light on the possible integration challenges that are imposed by the integration of WSNs and LTE which manifest themselves in the difference in traffic characteristics. We perform some experiments to explore the behavior of specific WSN application traffic.

Despite all the hype surrounding SDNs, exploiting its full potential is demanding. Security is still the key concern and is an equally striking challenge that reduces the growth of SDNs. Moreover, the deployment of novel entities and the introduction of several architectural components of SDNs pose new security threats and vulnerabilities. Besides, the landscape of digital threats and cyber-attacks is evolving tremendously, considering SDNs as a potential target to have even more devastating effects than using simple networks. Security is not considered as part of the initial SDN design; therefore, it must be raised on the agenda. This article discusses the state-of-the-art security solutions proposed to secure SDNs. We classify the security solutions in the literature by presenting a thematic taxonomy based on SDN layers/interfaces, security measures, simulation environments, and security objectives. Moreover, the article points out the possible attacks and threat vectors targeting different layers/interfaces of SDNs. The potential requirements and their key enablers for securing SDNs are also identified and presented. Also, the article gives great guidance for secure and dependable SDNs.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","4","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of an open wireless medium and unattended deployment leaves these systems vulnerable to intelligent adversaries whose goal is to disrupt the system performance. In this paper, we study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary establishes a link between two geographically distant regions of the network by using either high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing constraints of real-time control systems by first creating low-latency links, which attract network traffic, and then delaying or dropping packets. Since the wormhole attack reroutes and replays valid messages, it cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling and mitigating the wormhole attack. We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. By integrating existing mitigation strategies into our framework, we analyze the throughput, delay, and stability properties of the overall system. Through simulation study, we show that, by selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the physical system.","0018-9286","","","10.1109/TAC.2014.2351871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882790","Cyber-physical systems;networked control systems;passivity;wireless networks;wormhole attack","Cryptography;Delays;Networked control systems;Resource management;Routing;Silicon","computer network security;cryptography;delays;networked control systems;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","cryptographic mechanisms;delay constraints;network flows;network traffic;networked control systems;packet delays;passivity framework;wireless network;wormhole attacks","","1","","19","","2014-08-28","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g and Bloom-Q, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio.

In this architecture we consider all of important aspects of security that they are: authentication, integrity, authorization, confidentiality, availability and non-repudiation. For each aspect is considered the most important web service threats. Furthermore we consider likelihood and impact factor for each threat. Then we compute weight of each impact with using AHP and finally total security index is computed with weighted averaging.","","978-1-4673-2100-6","","10.1109/ICCT.2012.6511304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511304","Risk Analysis;SOA;Security;Web Service","","Web services;analytic hierarchy process;authorisation;message authentication;quality of service;service-oriented architecture","AHP;QoS properties;SOA;Web service security;Web service threat;authentication;authorization;confidentiality;impact factor;integrity;likelihood factor;nonrepudiation;security index;security weakness assessment;service provider;three level hierarchical architecture","","0","","13","","","9-11 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They can be deployed as protection mechanisms to an organization's real systems, or as research units to study and analyze the methods employed by individual hackers. In this paper we present the results of a research honeypot's operation, which undertook the role of a web trap for attackers who target the SSH service in order to gain illegal server access. The fake system has remained online and fully operational during a course of several consequent months, capturing attacks and logging all malicious activity. During this assessment it was shown that honeypots remain very effective tools in gathering information about SSH attacks. Furthermore, we observed that attackers are constantly targeting servers in the wild employing ready-to-use tools and dictionaries, while their post-compromise actions include mostly pivoting and IRC-related activities. Lastly we present a visualization tool aimed at helping security researchers during the analysis and conclusions drawing phases, for use with the same SSH honeypot implementation software as outlined in this work.","","978-1-4673-2230-0","","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6624967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6624967","cyber attack analysis;cyber crime;honeypot;secure shell;security visualization","Data visualization;Information security;Internet;Operating systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;network servers","IRC related activitt;SSH attack;SSH honeypot implementation software;SSH service;Web trap;computer security;fake system;honeypot operation;illegal server access;malicious user;protection mechanisms;secure shell","","2","","24","","","1-4 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore a need for Intrusion Detection Networks arises. Collaborators could be used here to enhance the detection of attacks. But still this concept suffers from lack of trustworthiness in the distributed environment. We introduce Mobile Agents (MA) to handle this problem effectively. A DCE - TRUST architecture is proposed where MAs are used to migrate from one node to another autonomously within the range of collaborators in and out of each network to inform them about the detected intrusions accurately and in a timely manner. We also found that the proposed architecture enhances detection rate and minimizes the rate in which each node gets to know about the attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844188","Collaborative and Distributed Environment;Mobile Agents;Trust","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Genetic algorithms;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Market research","computer network security;groupware;mobile agents;trusted computing","DCE-TRUST architecture;distributed environment;intrusion detection networks;mobile agents;network performance;trustworthy distributed collaborative intrusion detection","","0","","19","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, this work investigates three aspects: 1) a <i>network</i> <i>vulnerability</i> as the nonuniform vulnerable-host distribution, 2) <i>threats</i>, i.e., intelligent malwares that exploit such a vulnerability, and 3) <i>defense</i>, i.e., challenges for fighting the threats. We first study five large data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new metric, referred to as the <i>nonuniformity</i> <i>factor</i>, that quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the Renyi information entropy that unifies the nonuniformity of a vulnerable-host distribution with different malware-scanning methods. Next, we draw a relationship between Renyi entropies and randomized epidemic scanning algorithms. We find that the infection rates of malware-scanning methods are characterized by the Renyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a nonunform vulnerable-host distribution extracted by a randomized scanning algorithm. Meanwhile, we show that a representative network-aware malware can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a nonuniformity factor when compared to a random-scanning malware at an early stage of malware propagation. This quantifies that how much more rapidly the Internet can be infected at the early stage when a malware exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a network-wide vulnerability. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network-aware malwares. Our results demonstrate that counteracting network-aware malwares is a significant challenge for the strategies that include host-based defenses and IPv6.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2025847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5153282","Attack models;network security;performance metrics","","IP networks;Internet;computer networks;entropy;invasive software","IPv6;Internet;Renyi information entropy;information-theoretic view;intelligent malwares;malware propagation;malware-scanning methods;network vulnerability;network-aware Malware attacks;nonuniform vulnerable-host distribution;nonuniformity factor;random-scanning malware;randomized epidemic scanning algorithms;vulnerability information","","8","","44","","2009-06-30","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the “big-dataism”. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.","","","","10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166057","","Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;XML","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data mining;public domain software;software engineering","Amazon EC2;Big-Dataism;Eclipse;Firefox;Novell;Open Office;RedHat;cloud based computation systems;cost analysis;data processing;denial of service attacks;open source bug tracking systems;polynomial time problem;software engineering;time analysis;very large open source repository mining","","0","","24","","","23-23 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using a dedicated malware for evading detection at the initial attack, an attacker quietly succeeds in setting up a front-line base in the target organization. Communication between the attacker and the base adopts popular protocols to hide its existence. Because conventional countermeasures deployed on the boundary between the Internet and the internal network will not work adequately, monitoring on the internal network becomes indispensable. In this paper, we propose an integrated sandbox system that deploys a secure and transparent proxy to analyze internal malicious network traffic. The adoption of software defined networking technology makes it possible to redirect any internal traffic from/to a suspicious host to the system for an examination of its insidiousness. When our system finds malicious activity, the traffic is blocked. If the malicious traffic is regarded as mandatory, e.g., For controlled delivery, the system works as a transparent proxy to bypass it.

This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2010.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528","Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing","Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server","Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing","ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols","","5","","34","","2010-06-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes.

The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features.

One has to understand that, despite some systems being considered secure, attackers will continue to discover new vulnerabilities, to try new attacks and some of those attempts will succeed. One approach to address this problem that is gaining momentum recently is intrusion tolerance. Based on this paradigm, there already are intrusion-tolerant network architectures that enhance the protection of critical infrastructures. This paper justifies how we combine the concept of intrusion-tolerant with public key infrastructure(PKI) and presents some in-sights on how to do it. With the kernel of PKI, which is certificate authority, this paper brings the concept of intrusion tolerance to CA, and gives a feasible scheme of CA based on intrusion tolerance. The most important part is that it discusses the system architect, a digital signature of CA based on intrusion tolerance, and the working process of the whole system.

In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed monitoring system with Sensor nodes located in Norway, Germany and China that allow to detect SIP-based attacks from the Internet. Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors.

Further on, we propose a new feature-selection method that ensures globally optimal feature sets. The new approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming problem (M01LP) by using the branchand-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear (O(n)) in the number n of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our GeFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application.

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy.

To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages. We subject our dataset - consisting of malicious and normal SIP messages - to Euclidean distance-based classifiers as well as four standard classifiers. Our results show vast differences for Euclidean distance-based classifiers on our dataset than reported in current literature. We further see that the standard classifiers are better able to classify an anomalous message when L is small.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990708","","Fires;Grammar;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Routing protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);signalling protocols;telecommunication traffic","ASCII message representation;Euclidean classifiers;Internet;Levenshtein distance;SIP messages;UDP;anomalous message detection;machine learning algorithms;message encryption;multimedia session establishment protocol;self-learning systems;self-similar session initiation protocol","","3","","17","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea of IDSEP is to detect malicious nodes based on energy consumption of sensor nodes. Sensor nodes with abnormal energy consumption are identified as malicious ones. Furthermore, IDSEP is designed to differentiate categories of ongoing DoS attacks based on energy consumption thresholds. The simulation results show that IDSEP detects and recognises malicious nodes effectively.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6543339","","","computer network security;energy consumption;wireless sensor networks","DoS;IDSEP;WSN;abnormal energy consumption;cluster-based wireless sensor networks;denial-of-service attacks;energy prediction;intrusion detection scheme;malicious nodes;sensor nodes;wireless communication broadcast nature","","1","","","","","June 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

In a step for providing secured and reliable broadband services, formal specification logic along with a novel immune-inspired security framework (I2MANETs) have been introduced.

The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence. That degradation must also be accurately measurable by a trusted and therefore external timing source. Accordingly, the benchmarking experiment that has been devised was performed using commodity hardware and freely available software, to determine which resources virtualization seems to degrade performance most significantly, and of these resources, which are most accurately timed externally. Although the results are preliminary, and strictly speaking, apply only to the actual hardware used in the experiment, they nonetheless show that there is potential to use passive network analysis to detect hardware based virtualization rootkits and associated malware.","","978-1-4673-1108-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280227","enhanced side-channel analysis;performance benchmarking;rootkit detection","Benchmark testing;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Timing;Virtual machine monitors","benchmark testing;invasive software;virtualisation","commodity hardware;freely available software;hardware virtualization;malware;performance benchmarking;performance degradation;rootkits;side-channel analysis method","","0","","21","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new framework for real-time alert correlation which consists of two phases: Alert Preprocessing Phase and Scenario Constructing Phase. In our structure, we aggregate alerts into graph structures and then we extract unknown attack scenarios with mining frequent structure patterns. This method is based on the observation that most alerts have frequent and sequential characteristic, since we can use frequent item set mining methods for extracting attack scenarios. Our algorithm is efficient in memory and time consumption. For evaluation of our algorithm we used DARPA2000 dataset.

To describe the outlined problem, we focus solely on externally observable executions generated by the observed system. Thus, we need some sort of tool being able to discover acceptable and unacceptable patterns in execution traces. Such a tool may be the rough set theory. According to the rough set theory, the vagueness of a subset of a finite universe U is defined by the difference of its upper and lower approximations with respect to a partition of U. In this paper, our starting point will be an arbitrary family of subsets of an arbitrary U, neither that it covers U nor that U is finite will be assumed. This new approach is called the partial approximative set theory.

However, the performance comparison is difficult because there is no efficient implementation of VM introspection in KVM. In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen.

In other words, it is a race of knowledge. In this paper, we present a service security modeling approach based on the agent-oriented requirement modeling framework, i*. In this approach, we first model system actors' rationale for delivery of the service function. Then, we model a malicious actor whose intention is to disable the system functionality by exploiting their knowledge about the service and potential attacks. We assume that attackers have full knowledge about the system, which is the worst case scenario. Finally, the method automatically identifies attack routes across the actors' dependency network based on the available knowledge. We use a recent network attack event to a major Internet service provider to illustrate the approach.","","978-1-4244-8089-0","978-0-7695-4105-1","10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615767","Service security;agent-orientation;attacker;risk","","Internet;computer network security;invasive software;software architecture","Internet service provider;agent-oriented requirement modeling;attack routes;attacker viewpoint;knowledge intensive process;malicious actor;service function;service security analysis;system owners","","2","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present an adaptive and evolving security (AES), and an adaptive trust management (ATM) approach to such autonomic messaging middleware systems, an approach that learns, anticipates, evolves and adapts to a changing environment at run-time in the face of changing threats. The methodology used in this research is partly analytical and partly experimental. This involves analysis of how the principles of AES and ATM can be applied to the environment resulting in the development of theoretical models which are then tested in practice by prototyping.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336915","Adaptive security;evolution;resilience;security metrics;security monitoring;self-healing;trust management","Adaptive systems;Communication system security;Communication systems;Environmental management;Fault tolerant systems;Message-oriented middleware;Prototypes;Robustness;Runtime environment;Testing","fault tolerant computing;middleware;security of data","active vulnerability assessment;autonomic message-oriented middleware platform;fault-tolerance;secure adaptive system;trust management","","1","","27","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the IANA pool of IPv4 addresses has run out, IPv6 will become increasingly important. Although the IPv6 protocol stack presents considerable advantages compared with the IPv4 protocol stack, IP source address spoofing is still exploited in IPv6 to initiate malicious attacks. Some techniques are proposed and deployed to implement source address validation at fine granularity. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of fine granularity IP source address validation, e.g. whether filtering technology is deployed to prevent hosts from using forged IP address. We develop a detection tool with controlled spoofing ability which can infer whether the function of filtering spoofing address packets is enabled. We run this tool in 12 famous universities in China and collect the testing data. We gather a total of 41373 probes from 324 clients, and each probe includes sending at least 5 packets with the same spoofing source address to the control server. Results reveal that, 77.02% of the spoofing probes are completely filtered, 0.29% of the spoofing probes are partly filtered and the rest spoofing probes are not filtered at all. Overall, this illustrates that techniques of source address validation have been widely deployed in campus networks. Our statistical results provide practical basis for the deployment and further development of source address validation protocols in IPv6 networks.","","978-1-4577-1668-3","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077038","IPV6;efficiency;fine granularity;source address validation;spoofing","Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Wireless networks","IP networks;computer network security;protocols","IANA pool;IPv4 addresses;IPv6 protocol;detection tool;fine granularity;malicious attacks;source address validation;spoofing address packet filtering","","1","","20","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.","","978-1-4799-0078-7","","10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707175","Anomaly detection;Database intrusion detection;Database security;Role-based profiling","Data structures;Database systems;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Vectors","Bayes methods;SQL;authorisation;pattern classification;query processing","IDS;NBC;RBAC database system;anomaly detection approach;compact data structure;error equal rate;hexplet;intrusion detection systems;naive Bayes classifier;normal database access behavior;raw transactional SQL queries;role administrated database;role-based access control database system;transaction-based approach;transaction-log entry;valuable information resources","","0","","20","","","26-28 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Routing through an integrated communication and social network","Bigrigg, M.W.; Carley, K.M.; Manousakis, K.; McAuley, A.","Inst. for Software Res., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Military Communications Conference, 2009. MILCOM 2009. IEEE","20100115","2009","","","1","7","This paper explores the robust routing of messages among individuals. Traditional routing assumes individuals provide messages to a device connected to a communications network that assumes all responsibility for message delivery. Although each individual may have links to multiple communication devices (office computer, PDA, cell phone), messages are delivered only if there is an end-to-end communication path between communication devices available to each individual. To improve robustness of communication, especially in dynamic ad hoc military networks, this paper models a novel routing paradigm using an integrated communication and social network. The understanding is that individuals can and do route messages through a social network in conjunction with the communication network. An example of this is an individual asking another in his immediate social network to place a call on his behalf when the official communication system is not convenient or is unavailable. We show that it is possible to route messages through the integrated social and communication network by: a) using the ORA social analysis tool to select normalized costs for the social and communication network links (e.g., to reflect the link delay, quality or robustness), and b) using the MONOPATI communication design tool to model the integrated socio-communication network as a graph and performing QoS routing. Results show that the robustness of message delivery can be improved by 5X through this joint routing, without unnecessary impacts on end to end latency.","","978-1-4244-5238-5","978-1-4244-5239-2","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379848","","","ad hoc networks;electronic messaging;military communication;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","MONOPATI communication design tool;ORA social analysis tool;QoS routing;dynamic ad hoc military networks;end-to-end communication path;integrated communication;message delivery;message routing;multiple communication devices;sociocommnunication network","","2","","18","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The autonomic computing and the knowledge plane are two promising initiatives proposed to cope with the ever-growth network complexity. In this article, we propose to use the piloting plane concept to grant autonomicity in current networks. This plane aims at optimizing existing applications by using elaborate algorithms fed by pertinent knowledge recovered from the knowledge plane. In our approach, we demonstrate that the knowledge and the piloting planes are complementary and both are required when implementing autonomic solutions. We illustrate our proposal by applying these concepts on the handover selection phase which is a key issue in the handover process for granting global mobility to users in heterogeneous environment. We also describe a first implementation of our handover piloting system. Results from preliminary tests in real environments scenario exhibit the effectiveness of our system.","","978-1-4244-4765-7","","10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5384717","","Computer network management;Decision making;Humans;Knowledge management;Large-scale systems;Mobile radio mobility management;Proposals;Subspace constraints;System testing;Technology management","communication complexity;fault tolerant computing;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio)","autonomic computing;autonomic piloting plane;global mobility;handover decision optimization;handover piloting;handover selection;heterogeneous environment;knowledge plane;network complexity;network control;network management","","1","","13","","","20-23 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given the complexities involved, identifying the most appropriate measures to counteract the latter threats is highly challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel simulation-optimization method that tackles this problem. It combines rich conceptual modeling of security knowledge with discrete event simulation and metaheuristic optimization techniques. By simulating attacks, the method infers possible routes of attack and identifies emergent weaknesses while accounting for adversaries' heterogeneous objectives, capabilities, and available modes of entry. The optimization iteratively adapts the system model by means of a genetic algorithm and optimizes its ability to detect ongoing attacks and prevent their successful execution. We describe a prototypical implementation and illustrate its application by means of scenarios for five types of adversaries.","","978-1-4799-2077-8","","10.1109/WSC.2013.6721583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6721583","","Abstracts;Context;Context modeling;Information systems;Optimization;Organizations;Security","discrete event simulation;genetic algorithms;information systems;security of data","adversary types;adversary-centric approach;attack detection;conceptual modeling;discrete event simulation;genetic algorithm;information security controls;information systems;metaheuristic optimization techniques;simulation-based optimization;simulation-optimization method","","0","","18","","","8-11 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach to detecting anomalies in business transactions and processes using a graph representation. In our graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) approach, anomalous instances of structural patterns are discovered in data that represent entities, relationships and actions.

To render networks more secure, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) aim to recognize attacks within constraints of two major performance considerations: high detection and low false-alarm rates. It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems. IDSs are firmly entrenched on the security front but the exact role they can play and what their deployment entails must be clear to planners of security.
