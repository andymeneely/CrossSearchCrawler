Due to these advancements more and more services are available for malicious exploitation. New vulnerabilities are found from common programs and even on vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network of an entire company. There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator. Then their performance has been analyzed using 10 classification algorithms. Finally the top ten combinations of feature selection have been evaluated among 1585 unique combinations. Combination of Symmetric and Gain Ratio while considering top 15 attributes has highest performance.","","978-1-4799-7682-9","","10.1109/PDGC.2014.7030720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030720","Boolean AND operator;Data Mining;Feature Selection Techniques;Garret's Ranking Technique;Intrusion Detection System;NSL-KDD Dataset;WEKA","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training;Vegetation","Boolean functions;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","Boolean AND operator;IDS;classification algorithms;combinational feature selection approach;malicious network traffic detection;network intrusion detection system;ranking based feature selection techniques","","0","","26","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Security Games for Node Localization through Verifiable Multilateration","Basilico, N.; Gatti, N.; Monga, M.; Sicari, S.","Sch. of Eng., Univ. of California, Merced, Merced, CA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on","20140205","2014","11","1","72","85","Most applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) rely on data about the positions of sensor nodes, which are not necessarily known beforehand. Several localization approaches have been proposed but most of them omit to consider that WSNs could be deployed in adversarial settings, where hostile nodes under the control of an attacker coexist with faithful ones. Verifiable multilateration (VM) was proposed to cope with this problem by leveraging on a set of trusted landmark nodes that act as verifiers. Although VM is able to recognize reliable localization measures, it allows for regions of undecided positions that can amount to the 40 percent of the monitored area. We studied the properties of VM as a noncooperative two-player game where the first player employs a number of verifiers to do VM computations and the second player controls a malicious node. The verifiers aim at securely localizing malicious nodes, while malicious nodes strive to masquerade as unknown and to pretend false positions. Thanks to game theory, the potentialities of VM are analyzed with the aim of improving the defender's strategy. We found that the best placement for verifiers is an equilateral triangle with edge equal to the power range R, and maximum deception in the undecided region is approximately 0.27R. Moreover, we characterizedâin terms of the probability of choosing an unknown node to examine furtherâthe strategies of the players.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560057","Game theory;localization games;security;wireless sensor networks","Electronic mail;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;Robustness;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;security of data;wireless sensor networks","VM;game theory;malicious node;node localization;noncooperative two-player game;probability;security games;trusted landmark nodes;verifiable multilateration;wireless sensor networks","","0","","42","","2013-07-16","Jan.-Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But security in a wireless environment is paramount, and it is essential to have secure transmission and reception of information. Hackers and Crackers can easily jeopardize and break into a LAN, and can compromise the confidentiality, and integrity of information. Hence, it is essential to provide some mechanism to ensure that sharing of information in a wireless environment, as well as the basic operation of a wireless LAN is without any risk.

It is therefore desirable to automate as much as possible the firewall configuration process. Accordingly, this work presents a new more active and scalable fire walling architecture based on dynamic and adaptive policy management facilities, thus enabling the automatic generation of new rules and policies, to ensure a timely response in detecting unusual traffic activity and identify unknown potential attacks (0day).

Also, rather than proving well-known abilities of SOM on classification, our main concern in this work was investigating effects of principal component analysis on quality of feature vectors. In order to signify the power of success, KDD Cup 1999 dataset is used. KDD Cup dataset is a common benchmark for evaluation of intrusion detection techniques. The dataset consists of several components and here, it is used `10% corrected' test dataset. Since the feature vectors obtained from the dataset have prominent impact of success on the method, the usage of PCA and a method of choosing reliable components are introduced. At the end it is mentioned that the success of decision by the proposed method has been improved.

However, modern security systems that are applied in today's highly dynamic ICT networks, including malware scanners and intrusion detection systems, apply a kind of black-list approach, where they consider only actions and behavior that match to well-known attack patterns and signatures of malware traces. We argue that for the smart grid a more restrictive approach, that cannot be circumvented by customized malware, will increase the security level tremendously. Therefore, in this paper we present a smart white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behavior over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. The application of such a system is promising in a smart grid environment which mostly implements well-specified processes, resulting in rather predictable and static behavior. We demonstrate the application of the system in a small-scale pilot case of a real utility provider.","","","","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816388","anomaly detection;event correlation;ict security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Malware;Privacy;SCADA systems;Smart grids","invasive software;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","Internet;access points;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection technique;attack patterns;black-list approach;electricity grid;intrusion detection systems;malware scanners;malware trace signatures;security level;security systems;smart grid ICT networks;smart white-list approach;system event tracking;utility provider","","2","","10","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we introduce an analytical model to evaluate the time of detection and the overhead (number of messages) of our collaborative watchdog approach.

In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets.

This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","5","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.

One important specification of such systems is high availability. Recent attacks to ICS illustrate that almost any cyber attack can be orchestrated on these systems. Current security techniques, tools, and methods cannot prevent these cyber attacks. Attacks may finally lead to malfunctioning or even disabling the ICS for a long time. The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here. Using the proposed scheme, the ICS is recovered from a compromised state and is put into a stable state. Preliminary experiments show that this scheme can significantly decrease the MTTR and improve the ICS availability.","","978-1-4673-6489-8","","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620079","Industrial Control System;Recovery;Security;System availability","Availability;Control systems;Educational institutions;Industrial control;Security;Servers;Workstations","industrial control;reliability;system recovery","ICS availability;MTTF;MTTR;cyber attack;industrial control systems;mean time to failure;mean time to recovery;recovery scheme","","0","","17","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current literature for CBAS primarily focuses on the accuracy of the system in order to reduce false alarms. However, these attempts do not consider various issues that might affect practicality in real world applications and continuous authentication scenarios. One of the main issues is that the presented CBAS are based on several samples of training data either of both intruder and valid users or only the valid users' profile. This means that historical profiles for either the legitimate users or possible attackers should be available or collected before prediction time. However, in some cases it is impractical to gain the biometric data of the user in advance (before detection time). Another issue is the variability of the behaviour of the user between the registered profile obtained during enrollment, and the profile from the testing phase. The aim of this paper is to identify the limitations in current CBAS in order to make them more practical for real world applications. Also, the paper discusses a new application for CBAS not requiring any training data either from intruders or from valid users.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581430","Authentication;Continuous Biometric;Impostor;Intruder;Security","","authorisation;behavioural sciences;biometrics (access control);computer crime","continuous biometric authentication;user behavioural characteristics;user profile","","1","","22","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To alleviate these issues, in this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting cyber-physical anomalies in NCIs using the concept of Cyber-physical data fusion. By employing Dempster-Shafer's “Theory of Evidence” we combine knowledge from the cyber and physical dimension of NCIs in order to achieve an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) capable to detect even small disturbances that are not detected by traditional approaches. The proposed ADS is validated in a scenario assessing the consequences of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and the propagation of such disturbances to the operation of a simulated power grid.","2325-6648","","","10.1109/DSNW.2013.6615505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615505","Anomaly Detection System;DDoS;Data Fusion;MPLS;Networked Critical Infrastructures;SCADA","Feature extraction;Ions;Monitoring;Throughput;Weaving","computer network security;inference mechanisms;multiprotocol label switching;power grids;virtual private networks","ADS;DDoS attack;Dempster-Shafer theory-of-evidence;ICT system attack;MPLS;NCI;VPN;anomaly detection system;cyber-physical anomaly;cyber-physical attack;cyber-physical data fusion;distributed denial-of-service;information and communication technologies;multiprotocol label switching;networked critical infrastructure;power grid;virtual private network","","1","","27","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is part of the standardized risk management, such as ISO 27001, and it is an essential tool in the PDCA cycle of continuous improvement.On the other hand, in Physical Security environment just a few organizations are still using risk management systems oriented on continuous improvement, based on PDCA cycles, such as ISO 31000. This may be the reason why Physical Security does not have extended experience on how to measure its performance. Notwithstanding, Managing Security, Information Technology, Customs Relations, Production, or any other function of a company or organization should be measured. Obviously what it is not measured cannot be evaluated. And if you cannot evaluate a function of a company, how do you know if their leaders are doing well? How do you know if you are providing appropriate resources or not? In this paper we analyze which Security aspects can be measured and how. Several sets of parameters are proposed to be considered, in order to analyze the Security resources of an Organization: Effectiveness (incidents and the success of his rejection); Efficiency (money, people, work hours); Performance (equipment breakdowns attendance times, officers absenteeism, etc.); Evolution of the threats addressed (incidents and attempts); Maturity of the resources (projects planned, implemented, on operation, audited). The existence of a methodology for measuring Security is essential in the implementation of a risk management system focused on continuous improvement. Measuring Security is a key to propose organizational goals and generate benchmarking among different branches or at different moments.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naïve Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Management of these processors and other system resources to achieve high forwarding rates is a key challenge. In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources. Our results are important for the development of secure access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access of communication networks from malicious users.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2398834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066967","Particle filters;intrusion detections;networked multi-robot systems;target tracking","Base stations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robot kinematics;Trajectory;Wireless communication","","","","0","","","","2015-03-24","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol. We analyze an arising non-cooperative TRA game and find that under certain realistic assumptions it only incentivizes TRAs if they are harmless to other stations; otherwise the selfish stations are induced to learn that TRAs are counterproductive.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2321577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810022","Ad hoc networks;EDCA;IEEE 802.11;QoS;game theory;selfish behavior;traffic remapping attack","Ad hoc networks;Games;IEEE 802.11 Standards;IP networks;Quality of service;Throughput;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;game theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;wireless channels","EDCA;IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network;TRA detection;TRA punishment;class-based approach;distributed discouragement scheme;enhanced distributed channel access;false intrinsic traffic class designation;higher traffic priority class;local ad hoc network;noncooperative TRA game;quality of service;traffic remapping attack","","0","","38","","2014-05-02","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","","978-1-4799-7324-8","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","0","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose new NFA-Split architecture, which reduces the amount of consumed FPGA resources in order to match larger set of regular expressions at multi-gigabit speed. The proposed reduction uses model of nondeterministic and deterministic automaton for effective mapping of regular expressions to FPGA. A new algorithm is designed to split the nondeterministic automaton transition table in order to map a part of the table into memory.

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides a whole new deployment model for enterprise web-applications. The cloud proposes significant cost cuts when compared to using an internal IT infrastructure. The ""pay for what you use"" model of cloud computing is significantly cheaper for a company than the ""pay for everything up front"" model of internal IT. Hardware Virtualization is the enabling technology behind many of the cloud infrastructure vendor offerings. Through virtualization, a physical server can be partitioned into any number of virtual servers running their own operating systems, in their allocated memory, CPU and disk footprints. From the perspective of the user or application on the virtual server, no indication exists to suggest that the server is not a real, physical server.

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed.

Finally, we measure the degree of inconsistency in formulae of such a rule set (using the Scoring function, Shapley inconsistency values and Blame measure for prioritized knowledge) and compare the in formativeness of these measures.

To address this problem, we propose a time and space based alert analysis technique which can correlate related alerts without background knowledge and offer attack graph to help the administrator understand the attack steps clearly and efficiently.

The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack. The proposed method was tested on an experimental smart grid system demonstrating enhanced cyber-security.","","978-1-4673-0161-9","978-1-4673-0162-6","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309292","Anomaly Detection;Critical Systems;Cyber Sensor;Domain Knowledge;Fuzzy Logic System;Smart Grid","Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Frequency selective surfaces;Fuzzy logic;Pragmatics;Sensitivity;Telecommunication traffic","fuzzy logic;security of data;smart power grids","IT2 FLS;anomaly detection algorithms;anomaly detection solution;cyber-security measures;false negatives rates;false positive rates;interval type-2 fuzzy logic system;linguistic domain knowledge;normal network behavior models;novel anomaly detection architecture;planned large scale deployment;smart grid network devices;smart grid systems","","2","","25","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data. Our extensive evaluation shows that, compared with pure statistical learning models, LEAPS achieves consistently higher accuracy when detecting real-world camouflaged attacks with benign program cover-up.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266838","Attack Detection;Program Analysis;Statistical Learning","Data models;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Libraries;Payloads;Statistical learning;Training","flow graphs;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program testing;security of data;statistical analysis","LEAPS;attack detection system;camouflaged attack detection;cyberinfrastructures;formal program analysis;malicious system events;statistical learning methods;supervised statistical learning methods;testing data","","","","","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By intruding into the SCADA system via the remote access points, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data and reconfigure devices to trip the system breakers. The cyber attacks are able to impact the reliability of the power system through the SCADA system. In this paper, six cyber attack scenarios in the SCADA system are considered. A Bayesian attack graph model is used to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks on the SCADA system, which will result in breaker trips. A forced outage rate (FOR) model is proposed considering the frequencies of successful attacks on the generators and transmission lines. With increased FOR values resulted from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities (LOLP) in reliability test system 79 (RTS79) are estimated. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks increases.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939397","Bayesian attack graph model;Cyber security;SCADA system;cyber-physical power systems;forced outage rate;loss of load probability;power system reliability","Bayes methods;Generators;Power system reliability;Reliability;SCADA systems;Substations","Bayes methods;SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power grids;power system reliability;power system security","Bayesian attack graph model;FOR model;LOLP;RTS79;SCADA system;critical data eavesdropping;cyber vulnerability;forced outage rate;loss of load probability;power grid reliability analysis;reliability test system 79;remote access point;supervisory control and data acquisition system;system breaker;system breaker trip","","0","","13","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Communication occurs within their same communication range only, and communicate directly each other. Otherwise, they should relay on their neighbors to send relay messages. In open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. A new instruction-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. In existing system RSA and Digital Signature are used. In this paper to reduce the network overhead caused by digital signature by using AES public key cryptography system and AODV routing protocol. To develop efficient instruction-detection mechanisms, protect MANET from attacks. It detects malicious misbehavior nodes more efficiently.","","978-1-4799-3835-3","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033917","Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV);Advanced Encryption Standard (AES);Digital Signature;Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA);Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);Routing Overhead (RO)","Digital signatures;Encryption;Mobile ad hoc networks;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","digital signatures;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;public key cryptography;routing protocols","AES public key cryptography system;AODV routing protocol;EAACK;MANET;RSA;digital signature;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attackers;malicious misbehaviour nodes;mobile ad hoc network;mobile computing;network overhead","","0","","24","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on","20090825","2009","","","285","289","Over the past few years, anomaly detection has been an increasing concern with the rapid growth of the network security. Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency. Further-more, it is suitable for anomaly detection with high detect rate and low false alarm rate.","","978-0-7695-3641-5","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222872","Hidden Markov model;anomaly detection;decision condition;rough set reduction;system call","Computer networks;Computer security;Costs;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Information science;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Set theory;Software","hidden Markov models;rough set theory;security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;network security;rough set reduction","","0","","11","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks infeasible to use conventional security solutions. There are lot of attacks on these networks which can be classified as routing attacks and data traffic attacks. Some of the data attacks in sensor nodes are wormhole, jamming, selective forwarding, sinkhole and Sybil attack. In this paper, we discussed about all these attacks and some of the mitigation schemes to defend these attacks.","","978-1-4799-0316-0","","10.1109/ISSP.2013.6526929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6526929","Jamming;Security;Selective Forwarding;Sinkhole;Sybil;Wireless sensor networks;Wormhole","Conferences;Jamming;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","Sybil attack;WSN;civilian domains;data traffic attacks;military domains;mitigation schemes;routing attacks;security attacks;sensor nodes;sinkhole attack;wireless sensor networks","","1","","33","","","1-2 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on a criticality model that uses modified Bezier curves to determine for each sensor node the corresponding frame capture rate, simulation results show that the network lifetime can be increased, that the stealth time is kept low and that sentry nodes succeed in detecting intrusions.","","978-1-4244-8074-6","","10.1109/RIVF.2010.5633062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633062","","Communication system security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Mission critical systems;Robot sensing systems;Surveillance","object detection;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","WVSN;disaster relief systems;dynamic criticality management scheme;event detection;intrusion detection;mission-critical video surveillance;modified Bezier curves;wireless video sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ill-disposed environment affects the monitoring infrastructure that includes the sensor nodes and the network. In addition, node failures and environmental hazards cause frequent topology changes, communication failures, and network partitioning. This in turn adds a new dimension to the fragility of the network topology. Such perturbations are far more common than those found in conventional wireless networks thus, demand efficient techniques for discovering disruptive behavior in such networks. Traditional fault diagnosis techniques devised for multiprocessor systems are not directly applicable to wireless sensor networks due to their specific requirements and limitations. This survey integrates research efforts that have been produced in fault diagnosis specifically for wireless sensor networks. The survey aims at clarifying and uncovering the potential of this technology by providing the technique-based taxonomy.

The computer viruses, worms, hackers, crackers, electronic eavesdropping and electronic fraud, intrusions are some of the problems that Computer Security experts are facing. The Intrusion Detection System is a common and widely used approach in a well formed network security policy. Information systems must be monitored and audited for potential attacks; but the challenge in this process is analyzing heavy loads of event logs and network traffic. Also to be able to recognize new kinds of threads that tack place in network every day in a timely and efficient manner. In this paper we considered Differential Evolution algorithm for training neural network for the intrusion detection system. We used KDD dataset for our experiments that is derived from the standard KDD CUP"" Intrusion Dataset. We also provided the comparative results of the differential evolution with the state of the art classification algorithm like RBF, Probabilistic Neural network (PNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. We reduced the dimension/features of the KDD datasets using PCA. The results of our study showed higher accuracy in intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767341","Differential Evolution (DE);Information security;Intrusion detection;MLP;PCA;PNN;RBF","Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Vectors","computer viruses;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification;principal component analysis","Information security;KDD dataset;KDD datasets;MLP;PCA;PNN;RBF;classification algorithm;computer security experts;computer viruses;crackers;differential evaluation algorithm;electronic eavesdropping;electronic fraud;event logs;hackers;information technology world;intrusion dataset;intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron neural network;network security policy;probabilistic neural network;worms","","0","","23","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Open Flow, a SDN standard, is currently the only standard that explicitly focuses on multi-vendor openness. Unfortunately, it only provides for traffic engineering on an integrated basis for L2-L4. The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice. Retention of multi-vendor openness for such an approach has not been previously reported in literature to the best of our knowledge. We report numerical results from our prototype, characterizing the performance and practicality of this prototype by implementing a video reconditioning application on this platform.","","978-1-4799-6203-7","","10.1109/ICNP.2014.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980433","","Delays;Engines;Hardware;Process control;Prototypes;Streaming media;Video recording","protocols;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","L7-based policies;Open Flow data path;SDN standard;data path flow table;deep packet inspection;external processing box;forwarding engines;forwarding equipment;multivendor openness;network operators;open paradigm;payload inspection;protocol extension;resource allocation policies;scalability barriers;service insertion;software defined networking;traffic characterization;traffic engineering;traffic steering;video reconditioning application","","0","","16","","","21-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection system is more efficient compared to firewalls in detecting DOS attack generated due to internal traffic. However, single IDS system usually fails in detecting novel attack and produces larger false alerts. This paper proposes a method for heterogeneous alert fusion for detection of DOS attacks. The proposed method shows increase in the detection rate of about 20% compared to signature based IDS and 10% compared to anomaly based IDS. On the other hand the False alarm rate reduces by 40%. Alert fusion results for two redundant IDS as well as two complementary IDS have been demonstrated.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155825","Alert Fusion;DARPA dataset;DOS attacks;Dempster-Shafer Theory;Detection Rate;Intrusion Detection System","Computer crime;Databases;Detectors;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Reliability","Internet;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DOS attack detection;IDS heterogeneous alert fusion;Internet;attack detection;denial of service attacks;false alarm rate;internal traffic;intrusion detection system;signature based IDS;single IDS system","","0","","14","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
