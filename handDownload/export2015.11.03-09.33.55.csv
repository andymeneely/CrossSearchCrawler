Most existing works mainly investigate the system performance given the attacking patterns. In this paper, we investigate how the attacker should design its DoS attacking policy so that the system performance can be deteriorated as much as possible. Specifically, we consider the scenario where a sensor sends its data to a remote estimator through a wireless channel for state estimation, while an attacker decides whether to jam the channel at each sampling time. For two typical system performance indexes, i.e., the expected average estimation error and the expected terminal estimation error, we construct optimal attack scheduling schemes, respectively. We also propose the optimal attack schedules to avoid the given intruder detection mechanism. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.","0743-1546","978-1-4673-5714-2","","10.1109/CDC.2013.6760746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6760746","","Erbium;Jamming;Lead","scheduling;state estimation;telecommunication security;wireless channels","CPS security;attacking patterns;cyber-physical system security;denial-of-service attack;expected average estimation error;expected terminal estimation error;intruder detection mechanism;optimal DoS attack policy;optimal attack scheduling schemes;remote state estimation;sampling time;system performance;wireless channel","","2","","22","","","10-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation order of selection constructs can significantly influence the overall performance of multiple query evaluation. Consequently, based on the filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence of selection constructs dynamically captured at run-time, a selection-early strategy establishes the efficient evaluation sequence adaptively. For this purpose, the overall filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence is periodically monitored and the sequence is rearranged when its filtering capability is varied higher than a specific threshold. Accordingly, this strategy keeps the current evaluation sequence to be as efficient as possible by coping with a dynamic variation of its filtering capability. The experimental studies of the proposed strategy show that it is practically more scalable and stable than other approaches.","","978-1-4673-2087-0","","10.1109/ComManTel.2013.6482420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6482420","ASC;PSC;XML stream;adaptive query optimization;data stream;multiple continuous queries;relational stream;selection-early strategy","Filtering;Monitoring;Optimization;Query processing;Routing;Synthetic aperture sonar;XML","","","","0","","10","","","21-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of intrusion detection systems have been proposed for ad-hoc networks. Such intrusion detection systems cannot perform well for wireless mesh networks due to its multihop decentralized architecture. The selection of optimal and secure routing path and detection of multilayer security attacks cannot be achieved using traditional single layer IDS. Most of the MAC layer attacks occur due to non compliance of protocols by the nodes. Such a malicious behavior cannot be detected using conventional IDS. In this paper, a Cross Layer based Intrusion detection system has been proposed which takes advantage of the information available across different layers of protocol by activating multiple layer monitoring and detection. The proposed Cross layer based IDS is novel in its architecture and is able to detect multi layer attacks of compound nature. It can also detect low intensity attacks and attack switching behaviors which have been the major shortcoming of most of the existing IDS for Wireless Networks.","","978-1-61284-689-7","","10.1109/ISCI.2011.5959000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959000","Cross Layer Approach;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Mesh Networks;multi layer attacks","Cross layer design;Delay;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Throughput","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","MAC layer attacks;ad-hoc networks;attack switching behaviors;cross layer based intrusion detection system;distributed cross layer approach;encryption software;low intensity attacks;multihop decentralized architecture;multilayer attacks;multilayer security attacks;secure communication;secure routing path;wireless mesh networks;wireless multihop networks","","1","","18","","","20-23 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, they also allow the exploitation of regular expression properties that show up at the data structure level as common transitions shared between multiple states, resulting in storage reductions of up to 95% for five NIDS pattern sets analyzed.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","0","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An innovative framework for collaborative intrusion alert correlation","Elshoush, H.T.I.","Comput. Sci.

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model. Comparisons with a previous correlation system were performed. The results of processing these datasets and recognizing the attack patterns demonstrated the potential of the improved correlation model and gave favorable results.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918249","Alert Correlation;Alert Reduction;False Alarm Rate;Intrusion Detection Systems","Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition","security of data","CIDS;attack patterns;collaborative intrusion alert correlation;collaborative intrusion detection systems;correlation components;correlation process performance;correlation processing time;innovative alert correlation model;innovative framework;intruders intention;modified algorithm;security related activity","","0","","34","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654513","Sensor networks;local monitoring;malicious nodes.;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna","Antennas;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Sleep;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ELMO;WSN;energy aware local monitoring;energy constrained system;energy consumption;local monitoring based security algorithm;sleep wake management;wireless sensor network","","3","","40","","2010-12-03","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.","","978-1-4799-8098-7","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618","Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System","Hafnium;IP networks","Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing","AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback","","0","","18","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As it is used for both supporting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, and connecting vehicles to external resources including cloud services, Internet, and user devices while improving the road traffic conditions, VANET is a Key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As such, VANET can be exposed to cyber attacks related to the wireless environment, and those of traditional information technologies systems it is connected to. However, when looking at solutions that have been proposed to address VANET security issues, it emerges that guaranteeing security in VANET essentially amounts to resorting to cryptographic-centric mechanisms. Although the use of public key Infrastructure (PKI) fulfills most VANET' security requirements related to physical properties of the wireless transmissions, simply relying on cryptography does not secure a network. This is the case for vulnerabilities at layers above the MAC layer. Because of their capability to bypass security policy control, they can still expose VANET, and thus, the ITS to cyber attacks. Thereby, one needs security solutions that go beyond cryptographic mechanisms in order cover multiple threat vectors faced by VANET. In this paper focusing on attack detection, we show how using an implementation combining observation of events and incidents from multiple sources at different layers Sybil nodes can be detected regardless of the VANET architecture.","","","","10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7245674","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS);Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) security;attack detection","Communication system security;Cryptography;IP networks;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","intelligent transportation systems;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","IEEE802.11p standard;VANET;attack detection;cryptographic-centric mechanisms;cyber attacks;intelligent transportation systems;mobile ad hoc network;security analytics;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless mobile environment","","0","","","","","5-7 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DLPS is based on a content scanning engine which defines a new type of matching problem, called longest overlap matching which also exits in many other applications as a basic problem where contents are delivered by small blocks. We study the problem by comparing it with the traditional pattern matching problem in Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) whose solutions are based on finite automata. We develop a new finite automata representation called Skip-Finite Automata (Skip-FA) which detects the packets carrying sensitive information by using default transitions to implicitly track the overlapping parts between packets' payloads and sensitive files. The simulation results shows that our system achieves a matching speed of about 10B+ per memory access for small file set (>;20KB) and 100B+ per memory access for large file set (>;2500KB).

Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed approach that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing events for early cyber attack warning and notification.","","","","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849283","","Conferences;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Probes","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;information theory;invasive software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;coordination pattern;cyber attack;cyber threat intelligence;cyberspace;data mining methods;early cyber attack notification;early cyber attack warning;emergency response teams;fuzzy approaches;information theoretical metrics;large-scale orchestrated probing events;malicious activities;malicious real darknet data;malware traffic;network security analysts;orchestration pattern;routable unallocated IP addresses;signal techniques;statistical techniques","","0","","15","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to protect information security, significant research and standardizations efforts have been made in recent years. However, most of these activities focus on specific issues, which cannot mitigate negative effects as a whole. In this paper, we first introduce a common architecture of smartphones including main smartphone assets. Then we identify smartphone threats which are clustered into vulnerabilities and attacks.

Shannon entropy is developed firstly to analyze the distribution characteristics of alert with five key attributes including source IP address, destination IP address, source threat, destination threat and datagram length. Then, the Renyi cross entropy is employed to fuse the Shannon entropy vector and detect the anomalies.

Currently proposed traceback mechanisms are inadequate to address the traceback problem for the following reasons: they lack incentives for ISPs to deploy IP traceback in their networks; they do not scale to large scale distributed DoS attacks. In this paper, a novel IP traceback approach based on packet logging and deterministic packet marking (LDPM) is proposed, that significantly improves IP traceback in several aspects: (1) LDPM is built on a distributed hierarchical IP traceback system, and is simple to deploy. (2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers. Compared with previous traceback schemes, LDPM improves the performance and practicability of IP traceback.","","978-0-7695-3825-9","","10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341555","IP traceback;deterministic packet marking;distributed denial of service;network security;packet logging","Computer crime;Computer networks;Embedded computing;Encoding;IP networks;Information security;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Privacy;Protection","IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP header encoding scheme;IP spoofing attack;IP traceback mechanism;attack ingress router;deterministic packet logging;deterministic packet marking;distributed hierarchical IP traceback system;network topology privacy protection;single packet router","","3","","24","","","25-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules. A worst-case analysis shows that the saving in hardware resources is achieved with a relatively small buffer space, currently available in cheap, low end, FPGA boards, with no impairment on the resulting throughput.","1946-1488","978-1-4244-7842-2","","10.1109/FPL.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694212","","","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based solution;NIDS;elastic buffers;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;reconfigurable rule matching core;reprogrammability;worst-case analysis","","5","","13","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, MHGIS feature selection and Chi<sup>2</sup> feature selection have been employed on the pre-processed data, to reduce the number of attributes. Thirdly, we measure the recognition performance by using supervised learning algorithms which are C4.5, BPNN, RBF and SVM. Lastly, we evaluate the results received from MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup>. From the KDDCup99 dataset, we got 13,499 randomly sampling patterns with 34 data dimensions. With the use of MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup> algorithms, we obtain 14 and 26 features respectively.

We introduce the concept of a loss profile, which encapsulates the idea of variable loss due to infection. Through the application of a simple loss profile to this interdependent network security scenario, we conclude that the decision is dependent upon a number of factors including external and internal vulnerabilities, the types and likelihoods of different amounts of loss, and the interaction of all of these effects.

To solve this problem, this paper presents an approach to recognize constellation satellites' usability automatically by computer using clustering. According to the relationship between satellite's usability and its orbit characteristics, using the latest orbit parameters downloaded from the internet, this approach recognizes the satellites according to their differences in orbit characteristics.

Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/ network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently.","","","","10.1109/BWCCA.2013.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690909","Anomaly Detection;IDS;SCADA;Secure Service","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers","Internet;SCADA systems;computer network security;critical infrastructures;cryptographic protocols;operating systems (computers)","Internet;abnormal command execution identification;base rule set;communication protocol;dynamically produced rule set;intrusion detection system;m-connected SCADA network vulnerability;m-connected status;national critical infrastructure;network anomaly detection;network protocol;network-based pattern reference method;operating systems;pattern reference model;pre-known intrusion pattern;private network;public network;security model;specific threshold value;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","12","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network. We also review the routing protocols of ad-hoc networks with trust considerations and select Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), a protocol that can be used in distributed ad hoc network settings for path discovery.","","978-1-4244-6701-3","","10.1109/WAINA.2010.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480623","mobile ad hoc networks;routing;security;trust;trust-formalization","Ad hoc networks;Collaborative work;Conferences;Distributed control;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;International collaboration;Resource management;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol","ad hoc networks;decision making;mobile communication;routing protocols","MANET;decision making;dynamic enterprise collaborations;dynamic source routing;mobile ad-hoc networks;networking technology;routing protocols;trust formalization","","4","","16","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These networks do not require any existing infrastructure or network support. The lack of a central infrastructure imposes challenges, as services ensured by central infrastructure must be ensured by mobile nodes in the new environment. The network operation is decentralized as the network's organization/message delivery is effected by nodes. A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is functional in either a stand-alone manner or connected to large networks. In this work, a hybrid optimization technique using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Cuckoo Search (CS) is proposed for the optimization of MANET routing.

The choice of kernel function and relative parameters plays an important role in SK-SVM. It greatly influences the generalization performance of SK-SVM. According to the limitation of SK-SVM, in this paper we present an intrusion detection method based on multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM). MK-SVM can calculate the weights of kernel functions and Lagrange multipliers simultaneously through semi-infinite linear programming, and thus achieve the choice of kernel functions and the optimization of classifier. Furthermore, in order to reduce the time and space required of this method, we adopt feature selection and clustering method in the process of input data preprocessing. The experimental results using KDD CUP 1999 show that our method has better adaptability and higher detection accuracy than the method based on SK-SVM.","","978-1-61284-347-6","","10.1109/NCIS.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948806","RBF kernel function;feature selection;kernel method;multiple kernel learning;support vector machine","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training","feature extraction;linear programming;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","KDD CUP 1999;Lagrange multipliers;MK-SVM;SK-SVM;classifier optimization;clustering method;data preprocessing;feature selection;intrusion detection method;kernel function;multiple kernel support vector machine;network intrusion data;semiinfinite linear programming","","0","","12","","","14-15 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Enhancing security in CAN systems using a star coupling router","Kammerer, R.; Fromel, B.; Wasicek, A.","Inst. for Comput.

Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based CAN are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based CAN, but are detected and contained on router-based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems.","","978-1-4673-2685-8","978-1-4673-2683-4","10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356590","","Automotive engineering;Multicast communication;Routing;Security;Software;Topology","computer network security;controller area networks;software maintenance","CAN router;CAN systems security;automotive applications;automotive domain;bus-based CAN;controller area network;denial-of-service attacks;eavesdropping;failure propagation;legacy CAN based systems;message fabrication;power train;router-based CAN;safety domain;safety-critical subsystems;star coupling router;trust model","","2","","24","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","0","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SMARTDIAB consists mainly of two units: 1) the patient unit (PU); and 2) the patient management unit (PMU), which communicate with each other for data exchange. The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment. The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits. The pilot version of the SMARTDIAB has already been implemented, while the platform's evaluation in clinical environment is being in progress.","1089-7771","","","10.1109/TITB.2009.2039711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5401101","Closed-loop glucose control;diabetes management;home care;information and communication technologies;telemedicine","","Internet;decision support systems;diseases;medical information systems;patient care;patient monitoring;patient treatment;telemedicine;wireless LAN","Internet;SMARTDIAB;Web server;Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service;continuous glucose measurement system;decision support system;diabetes data management system;front-end interfaces;health management;insulin infusion advisory system;insulin infusion rate;insulin pump;patient management unit;patient monitoring;patient treatment;patient unit;subcutaneous insulin infusion;type 1 diabetes mellitus patients","Blood Glucose;Cellular Phone;Computer Communication Networks;Data Mining;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Disease Management;Humans;Infusions, Subcutaneous;Insulin Infusion Systems;Medical Informatics Applications;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Nonlinear Dynamics;Spectrum Analysis, Raman;Telemetry;User-Computer Interface","17","1","49","","2010-01-29","May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different intrusion detection techniques can be employed to search for attack patterns in the observed data. Misuse detection and anomaly detection are the most commonly used techniques. But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naïve bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced. This is used to form new features, based on the features of the original data set.

Most existing approaches have focused on intrusion detection and post-attack responses in a similar fashion to fault detection and recovery. However, attack behaviors are much more complex and less predictable than fault behaviors as an attacker often changes his course of actions during the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach that can incorporate behaviors of attackers into the decision analysis of security management. This is especially crucial as attackers can keep advancing their techniques to outsmart security technologies. Our research aims to enhance the science of security that enables behavioral modeling as well as model extensibility. In particular, we present an analytical game theoretic approach to analyzing security of smart grid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems by including attacker/defender behaviors in the proposed sequential, non-zero sum, and two-player game model. The paper describes the development of the game payoffs and illustrates how informed decisions can be made on a real-world scenario of attacks at the sensor level of the smart grid SCADA systems.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007770","Game theory;SCADA;SCADA security;Sequential games;payoffs;utility function","Conferences;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Smart grids","SCADA systems;decision theory;fault diagnosis;game theory;power system faults;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","behavioral modeling;cyber attack game analysis;decision analysis;fault detection;fault recovery;game payoffs development;informed decision derivation;intrusion detection;model extensibility;nonzero sum game model;post-attack response;security management;sequential game model;smart grid SCADA system security;smart grid protection;supervisory control-and-data acquisition;two-player game model","","0","","15","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, here we report on the technological strategy we adopted in order to protect a “specific” railway depot, but representative of a quite common scenario in railway environment for outdoor security applications. One of the concerns associated with to the protection of a railway area, indeed, relies on the unavoidable presence of the railroad tracks that cannot be practically obstructed with physical barriers. We propose an integrated optical fiber sensing system, composed by FBGs strain sensors, deployed in a network, to detect human intrusion through the perimeter to be protected, combined with FBG accelerometers sensors to protect the rail track access. Several trials have been carried out in indoor and even outdoor environment. Experimental results reveal that FBGs strain sensors, bonded under a ribbed rubber mat, enable the detection of intruder's break-in and FBG accelerometer sensors, installed under rails, enable the detection of walking intruder on the railroad tracks through the acoustic surface waves generated by the footsteps. The integrated system, based on a single enabling technology, represents a valuable intrusion detection system for railway security and could be further integrated with other sensing functionalities in the railway field using the fiber optic technology.","","","","10.1109/MePhoCo.2014.6866483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866483","Intrusion detection system;fiber Bragg gratings;optical fiber sensors","Accelerometers;Fiber gratings;Optical fiber sensors;Rail transportation;Rails","Bragg gratings;fibre optic sensors;railways;safety systems;strain sensors;surface acoustic waves","acoustic surface waves;fiber Bragg grating sensors;human intrusion;integrated optical fiber sensing system;intrusion detection system;outdoor security applications;railroad tracks;railway assets protection;railway environment;ribbed rubber mat;strain sensors;walking intruder","","0","","5","","","7-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The antiquated nature of some of the most widely used datasets along with their inadequacies is examined and used as a basis for discussion of a new approach to analyzing network traffic data. Live network traffic is collected that consists of real normal traffic and both real and penetration testing attack data. Attack data is then inspected and labeled by means of manual analysis. While network attacks and anomaly features vary widely, they share some commonalities that are examined here. Among these are: self-similarity convergence, periodicity, and repetition. Further, the knowledge inherent in the definition of network boundaries and advertised services can provide crucial context that allows the network analyst to consider self-aware attributes when examining network traffic sessions. To these ends the Session Aggregation for Network Traffic Analysis (SANTA) dataset is proposed. The motivation and the methodology of collection, aggregation and evaluation of the raw data are presented, as well as the conceptualization of the SANTA attributes and advantages provided by this approach.","","","","10.1109/BIBE.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033608","Network traffic data;intrusion detection;periodicity","Context;IP networks;Internet;Ports (Computers);Security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","aggregation;data analysis;fractals;medical information systems;security of data","SANTA dataset;anomaly detection systems;intrusion detection systems;network security datasets;self-similarity convergence;session aggregation for network traffic analysis dataset","","0","","25","","","10-12 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Decision making is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the whole dataset is divided into some predetermined arbitrary subgroups. The proposed algorithm selects representative samples from these subgroups such that the samples reflect the entire dataset. An optimum allocation scheme is developed based on the variability of the observations within the subgroups. In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted samples to detect intrusions. We call the proposed algorithm as optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine (OA-LS-SVM) for IDS. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are carried out on KDD 99 database which is considered a de facto benchmark for evaluating the performance of intrusions detection algorithm.

In a distributed Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), collaboration and cooperation is critical concern to managing trust. The networks work well only if the mobile nodes are trusty and behave cooperatively. Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes. Trust-based approach provides a flexible and feasible approach to choose the shortest route that meets the security requirement of data packets transmission. This paper focuses on trust management with their properties and provides a survey of various trust-based approaches and it proposes some novel conceptions on trust management in MANETs.","","","","10.1109/SPACES.2015.7058292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058292","MANET;Properties of Trust;Security;Trust;Trust Management","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;centralized administration;data packets transmission;geographically limited area;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;packet forwarding misbehaviour;trust management;trust-based approach;trust-based model","","0","","36","","","2-3 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system. The paper presents the Evasion technique for customized apriori algorithm. The paper aims to make a new functional structure to evade NIDS. This framework can be used to audit NIDS. This framework shows that a proof of concept showing how to evade a self-built NIDS considering two publicly available datasets.","","978-1-4799-8083-3","","10.1109/ICIT.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033353","Evasion;Intrusion detection;Network intrusion detection system;Network security","Classification algorithms;Computers;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring","computer crime;computer network security","actual attack categorization;anomalous behavior;customized apriori algorithm;evade network intrusion detection system;evasion technique;hackers;hardware tool;hostile traffic;malicious behavior;modified apriori approach;network packets;network segments;self-built NIDS;software tool;visible attack","","0","","11","","","22-24 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flooding DDoS attacks produce adverse effects for critical infrastructure availability, integrity and confidentiality. Current defense approaches cannot efficiently detect and filter out the attack traffic in real time. Online analysis of real time attack traffic and their impact and degradation of host and network based performance metrics becomes very essential. So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack. The Interface Based Rate Limiting (IBRL) algorithm proposed in this paper is used to mitigate the identified DDoS attacks. The implementation is carried out on an experimental testbed build up on Linux machines and Virtual routers. The experimental results show that there is considerable increase in the host and network based performance metrics for legitimate users even under DoS and DDoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-1599-9","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206744","Distributed Denial of Service attack;host and network based performance metrics;rate limiting;virtual router","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Internet;Limiting;Measurement;Monitoring;Throughput","Linux;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack;DDoS detection;IBRL;Linux machines;critical infrastructure availability;critical infrastructure confidentiality;critical infrastructure integrity;cyber society;distributed denial of service attacks;experimental testbed;host-network based metrics;host-network based mitigation;interface based rate limiting algorithm;network performance metrics online measurement;real time attack traffic online analysis;virtual routers","","3","","15","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the resource aware scheduling we also modify the packets dropping strategy so that the sending rates of different flows are also correspondingly modulated. We evaluate RAQ performance via simulation experiments and the results demonstrate that RAQ can improve network resources utilization and throughput without imposing serious negative impact on packets delays.","","","","10.1109/ICCSNT.2013.6967229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967229","RAQ;multi-resource sharing;packet scheduling","Bandwidth;Random access memory;Resource management;Schedules;Scheduling algorithms;Switches;Throughput","Big Data;cloud computing;computer networks;queueing theory","big data computing;bottleneck resource;cloud computing;heterogeneous flows problem;multiresource in-network nodes;resource aware packet scheduling;resource aware queuing system;resource aware scheduling","","0","","12","","","12-13 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
