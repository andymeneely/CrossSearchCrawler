Recently, Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been employed to provide potential solutions for IDS. With its many variants for classification SVM is a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm. However, the performance of SVM depends on selection of the appropriate parameters. In this paper we propose an IDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection combined with the SVM classifier. The parameters for SVM will be selected by a swarm intelligence algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization or Artificial Bee Colony). We use the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can achieve higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate than regular SVM.","","","","10.1109/SACI.2014.6840052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840052","ABC and NSL-KDD;Intrusion Detection;PSO;SVM","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;NSL-KDD data set;artificial bee colony;classification SVM;detection rate;feature selection;information gain;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithm;particle swarm optimization;security infrastructure;support vector machine;swarm intelligence algorithm","","2","","31","","","15-17 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In light of these issues, this study describes an innovative, highly expressive framework for workflow modelling, guided by the <i>flexibility by design</i> principle. Main characteristics of the proposed approach include the following: (i) it enables the comprehensive specification of workflow elements, providing extensive coverage of all aforementioned perspectives; (ii) it introduces the novel concept of <i>assets</i>, as a means for representing the entities being subject to the execution of workflow tasks; (iii) workflows are defined as ontologies; this, apart from the inherent benefits regarding formal semantics, offers also the advantage of their direct and transparent integration with an ontological information model; (iv) it allows the explicit modelling of both control and data flows, thus being suitable for applications based on either of them or both of them combined; and (v) its expressiveness provides for the <i>in-design</i> expression of sophisticated security constraints.","1751-8806","","","10.1049/iet-sen.2013.0037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786867","","","data flow computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);workflow management software","comprehensive workflow modelling;control flow;core workflow perspectives;data flow;flexibility by design principle;formal semantics;in-design expression;ontological information model;ontology-based approach;sophisticated security constraints","","0","","","","","April 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

For this reason, many cryptographic security protocols have been developed over the past decades in an attempt to protect the privacy between communicating parties and to reduce the risk of malicious attacks. However, most of the cryptographic algorithms developed so far are based on mathematical models and suffer from many security defects, such as: a brute force attack, factorization problem, and many others. Thus, most of these proposed cryptographic systems are not proven to be completely secure against the main threats of modern networking technologies and computing systems. In this paper, a security framework model for quantum cryptography system which is based on the physical properties of light particles is proposed and all security requirements to assist in ensuring confidentiality between communicating parties are incorporated. The research work in this paper is based on a series of experiments which have been advocated recently by some agencies and researchers who used the quantum technology as a more effective method for solving the key distribution problem. The results of the proposed method is demonstrated and validated by experimental results.","","978-1-4799-3905-3","","10.1109/CyberSec.2014.6913972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913972","Cryptanalysis;Cryptography;Quantum Key Distribution;Quantum Technology;Security Protocols","Ciphers;Encryption;Optical fibers;Photonics;Public key","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;quantum cryptography","brute force attack;communicating parties;computers;computing systems;cryptographic algorithms;cryptographic security protocols;cryptographic systems;digital network environment;factorization problem;intellectual property;key distribution problem;malicious attacks;mathematical models;modern networking technologies;privacy;putting extra pressure;quantum cryptography system;quantum technology;security defects;security framework model;security requirements","","0","","35","","","April 29 2014-May 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798","False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust","Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing","Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value","","1","","21","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, many attempts have been made to study the intrinsic attributes of these insider attacks but the focus has generally been on the analysis of one or very few particular attacks, or only the survey of various attacks without any performance analysis. Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol. Route modification attacks such as sinkhole and blackhole are deadly and severely affect the packet efficiency and bring down the throughput to unacceptable ranges.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296111","Blackhole;Hello flood;MANETs;Network layer attacks;RREQ flood;Selective forwarding;Selfish Node;Sinkhole","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;RREQ flood;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;blackhole;blackhole attack;hello flood;malicious AODV;mobile ad hoc networks security;performance metrics;route modification attacks;routing attacks;selective forwarding attack;selfish node behavior;sinkhole;sinkhole attack","","4","","17","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many immune-inspired techniques have been developed with the aim to tackle different computing problems. Network security represents one of the most significant fields that the immune-inspired techniques have been applied to. Given that mobile ad hoc networks have a decentralized nature similar to the human immune system (HIS), immune-inspired security architecture is highly expected to come across different ad hoc security problems, one of which is the malicious node that can disrupt the routing process, masquerade as the legitimate nodes, and impersonate the trusted nodes. In this paper, immune-inspired security architecture for simulating a number of HIS processes for securing mobile ad hoc networks is presented. Both the negative selection and danger theory techniques have been combined along with many other inspired processes to come up with a scalable and robust system.

These systems emerge from inter-agent communication and the collective application of simple rules. The Digital Ants framework is a bio-inspired framework that uses lightweight, mobile agents. The agents communicate using digital pheromones which enable the agents to alert each other of possible cyber security issues. All communication and coordination is both localized and decentralized thereby allowing the framework to scale across the large numbers of devices that will exist in the Smart Grid. Furthermore, being lightweight makes the agents suitable for implementation on devices with limited computational resources.

With Internet connectivity to such devices, the smart grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is exposed to attacks by the adversary class. Any compromise of a smart meter may jeopardize the security of not just the household in question, but also the entire neighborhood network and possibly the utility provider's core network. One attack category that may pose a serious threat to the AMI is a meter compromise attack, wherein a smart meter is controlled by the adversary, with the intent of committing energy fraud. In this paper, we present a detection model based on a cumulative analysis of smart meter readings of clustered smart meters. The clustering of smart meters is done based on the physical deployment points of individual smart meters within a neighbourhood area network. Results obtained through simulation of the proposed scheme are promising.","","","","10.1109/IEEEGCC.2015.7060073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060073","","Conferences;Electricity;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Smart grids;Smart meters","Internet;power system security;smart meters;smart power grids;statistical analysis","AMI;Internet connectivity;advanced metering infrastructure;compromised smart meter detection;cumulative analysis;neighbourhood area network;smart grid;smart meter clustering","","0","","12","","","1-4 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These trends can make control systems vulnerable to cyber attack, which in the case of control systems may impact physical processes causing environmental harm or injury. We present some results of the DATES (Detection and Analysis of Threats to the Energy Sector) project, wherein we adapted and developed several intrusion detection technologies for control systems.

To protect these networks, intrusion detection systems are used. Signature-based intrusion detection cannot find previously unknown attacks, which is why anomaly detection is needed. However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible. The system is fast, finds intrusion attempts and does not need clean training data.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2014.6814006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814006","","Data mining;Data visualization;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems","digital signatures;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Mahalanobis distance;anomaly score;data point;intrusion attempts;intrusion detection systems;log lines;network data structure;network log anomaly detection system;network services;network traffic structure;numerical data matrix;random projection dimensionality reduction;real-world network data;signature-based intrusion detection","","0","","31","","","March 30 2014-April 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept of Kolmogorov complexity is used in many applications like spam filtering, data compression, information assurance etc. In this paper, we present the application of Kolmogorov complexity in network security field, particularly for anomaly detection. In order to accomplish that, it is assumed that most of the network attacks change the structure of the traffic. This enforces anomaly and hence subsequent intrusion can be detected if the structure or signature of the traffic flow is investigated. From this notion, we propose a signature based anomaly detection scheme. We show through simulation results that with the help of Kolmogorov complexity, we can detect traffic pattern abnormality in a simplistic way.

Current approaches use linear processes developed to handle single incidents with little attention paid to simultaneous or complex attacks encompassing many incidents, to coordination with other organizations, or the ability to scale to the size necessary for large, cross-cutting incidents. We have developed a coordination model for cyber incident management that provides enough structure to enable cooperative operations, but is sufficiently abstract to enable the organizational autonomy and customization essential for effective response for all types of organizations. It is easily understood, straightforward to apply, and versatile enough to overlay on existing organizational processes and structures, both for small, local activities as well as large, cross-organizational ones.

Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans.

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming. We show how to make fast and correct classification decisions under these constraints and apply them to real benchmark data.

Portscan module is required to maintain TCP connection records, the design of such a connection table is not trivial for a high speed IDS with large number of active connections and high packet arrival rate,especially in a resource constrains Intel IXP2400 network processor. After comparing various design options, we adapted from hash table data structure, employing the special hardware unit assist to calculate a hash over our unique ascending order quadruple which worked in a quite simple but efficient way that is totally different from the Snort scheme, our design not only differentiates both directions of a TCP connection and thus eliminates unwanted additional search operation, but also avoids data corruption and greatly reduces the probability of hash collisions. In order to improve the allocation/deallocation procedure for TCP connection nodes in our IDS systems, we further devised a large management stack caching with a local memory buffer, which is fully exploiting the specialized network processor architectures and optimizing the use of various types of memories with different speeds and size. The theoretical analysis and experiments confirmed that the combination of a large conventional hash table-based search and an array-based stack with caching improves the performance significantly.","","978-0-7695-3997-3","","10.1109/ICEE.2010.338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591627","IDS;hash table;nework processor;stack and cache","Context;Delay;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Random access memory;Resource management","cache storage;computer network security;cryptography;parallel processing;transport protocols","NP based IDS;SCUT NIDS;TCP;array based stack;hash table;network processor architecture;portscan detection module;stack caching","","0","","6","","","7-9 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates.

In addition, these schemes are vulnerable to mark spoofing and altering. To deal with these limitations, we propose in this paper an outbound global marking scheme which uses a novel structure, called mark association, that holds enriched information about the intruder activity either at the network, system or storage level.

However, those efforts concentrated on preventive techniques constituting a first line of defense (like cryptography and authentication), which are effective in inhibiting the diverse malicious attacks. Relatively, little attention has been paid for employing a second line of defense that can detect intrusive behavior after successfully penetrating the first one. The latter line of defense is known as the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). While mature in wired and many types of wireless networks, IDSs are envisaged to have more opportunities in WSNs.

Range of node specifies detection systems in wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks have been projected by academicians, of late. In the existing approach Leader based intrusion detection system is used to find out suspect regions where the compromised nodes are ensconced, here the Leader will be elected region wise based on the energy level to detect the attacker and revoke the compromised node. To overcome this as well as to provide high security two new stage approaches are proposed.

Unfortunately, a significant number of them are purchased by world-wide networks of ticket purchasing robots run by scalpers looking to turn a quick profit. Ticket outlets currently employ CAPTCHAs to slow down fully automated purchasing robots. Since the profit associated with scalping tickets is several orders of magnitude larger than the cost associated with paying humans to solve the CAPTCHAs, this approach has been ineffective. CAPTCHAs have a fundamental flaw when used to protect online tickets: the cost to solve them using humans is fixed and small. To address this problem, this paper explores a novel alternative based on geographically-driven proof-of-work. The crux of the approach exploits the observation that most legitimate clients are located geographically close to the event. By requiring every client to solve a cryptographic puzzle whose difficulty is based on their distance to the event, ticket purchasing robots must be placed close to each event in order to monopolize the tickets. This requirement significantly increases the cost of operating such networks. Using emulation and simulation, we demonstrate the utility of our approach in tackling the online ticketing problem.","","978-1-4244-6739-6","978-1-4244-6739-6","10.1109/INFCOMW.2010.5466663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466663","","Communications Society;Costs;Cryptography;Databases;Emulation;Humans;Marketing and sales;Protection;Robotics and automation;Robots","Internet;marketing data processing;security of data","CAPTCHA;TicketMaster;cryptographic puzzle;geographic proof-of-work;online ticket protection;scalping tickets;ticket purchasing robots","","1","","23","","","15-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Open RFID systems can only be effective if the systems can trust each other and be collaborative. The open system environment is also constantly evolving. So the trust and the collaborations need to be constantly maintained to cope with changes. RFID is becoming a ubiquitous computing technology imposing security and privacy threats. Counterfeiting in supply chain management is an attack with cloned and fraud RFID tags in order to gain illegal benefits.

The basis of the method is command interception and fast authentication from the cyber security point of view (reliable detection of cyber intrusions) and from the operational reliability point of view. To simplify the process, the command authentication is done at the relay level and relay controls. As such it does not depend on the communication architecture. The method is based on new developments on dynamic state estimation based protection and substation level distributed state estimation. This infrastructure provides the capability to monitor, intercept, and authenticate/block commands as they reach the relay and the control circuits of the relay. Since all controls are exercise through a relay, this approach provides 100% coverage. The authentication/blockage of commands is done quickly because of the distributed approach which enables quick assembly of a local real time model and fast analytics with this local model. Specifically, for each command the proper local real time model is constructed and quickly analyzed to determine the effects on the power system. The analytics determine the effect of the command, if executed, on the system and in particular on the operational reliability of the system. In case of a command that may have adverse effects on the operational reliability of the system, the command will be blocked and the operator will be alerted. In addition to the command authentication at the relay level, an open-source real-time network monitoring system for capturing and parsing network traffic is presented. Because the method is based on the substation level dynamic state estimator which uses only local substation level measurements and data, a byzantine type attack is not considered possible for the proposed approach. Finally, a discussion on the architecture required to integrate the network monitoring and state estimation sys- ems is presented. The methodology is presently being tested in a laboratory setup that includes a digital simulator of the electric power system and hardware in the loop.","1530-1605","","","10.1109/HICSS.2015.320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070135","Dynamic State Estimation;PMU;Protection","Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Relays;State estimation;Substations","power engineering computing;power system management;power system reliability;public domain software;real-time systems;security of data;state estimation","command authentication;command interception;cyber intrusions;cyber security;dynamic state estimation;electric power system;fast authentication;hardware in the loop;open-source real-time network monitoring system;operational reliability;operational security;substation level distributed state estimation","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First International","20090331","2009","","","1","10","In recent years there has been an immense proliferation of wireless networks and they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Thus there is a serious need to secure such networks from attacks. Usually an attacker can penetrate into a network by utilizing a chain of exploits. An exploit is a small piece of code that makes use of vulnerabilities present in a service or in a system. Each exploit in the chain has a set of preconditions and effects and lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploits. Application of such a chain of exploits generates a set of attack states or network states which form a path called the attack path and combining many such attack paths produces an attack graph. A lot of research has been done on issues such as scalable and time efficient ways of generation of attack graphs in wired network in contrast to that in wireless scenario. Moreover, the need is to identify the path that may be chosen by the attacker to comprise a target system in less time and effort. The proposed methodology in this paper aims as finding out the optimal or risk-prone attack path that the attacker may choose to penetrate a wireless network. The generation of attack paths in a wireless network is itself a difficult proposition due to networks inherent dynamic nature and ever changing topology. In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been employed for finding out the optimal attack path using an attack vector metric. The effort required on the part of the attacker to compromise a target system has been termed as an attack vector. The wireless nodes have been assigned severity measures obtained from customized risk parameters which serve as an input to the modified PSO technique. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.","","978-1-4244-2912-7","978-1-4244-2913-4","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808869","","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;IP networks;Information technology;National security;Network topology;Particle swarm optimization;Wide area networks;Wireless networks","particle swarm optimisation;radio networks;telecommunication security","attack graph;attack vector metric;chain-of-exploits;modified PSO;network security;optimal attack path;particle swarm optimization;wireless network","","1","","35","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advent of cloud computing, it is a big chance to mitigate this problem in such a promising environment. In our previous work, we proposed to construct an intelligent false alarm filter by selecting an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way, whereas the additional workload may be an issue for implementation. In this paper, we begin by presenting a Generic Cloud-based Intrusion Detection Architecture (GCIDA) and we then propose a cloud-based solution to improve the false alarm reduction and reduce the workload using Cloud as a Service (CaaS). In addition, we also describe the procedures and the interactions between the Cloud nodes and the Cloud providers. Experimental results indicate that CaaS can provide sufficient computing power and greatly reduce the workload of adaptive false alarm reduction.","","","","10.1109/ChinaCom.2013.6694633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6694633","Cloud Environment;Cloud as a Service;False Alarm Reduction;Intrusion Detection;Network Performance","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Control systems;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","alarm systems;cloud computing;security of data","CaaS;GCIDA;IDS;adaptive false alarm reduction;cloud as a service;cloud computing;cloud nodes;cloud providers;cloud-based solution;generic cloud-based intrusion detection architecture;intelligent false alarm filter;intrusion detection system;true alarm analysis","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regular expression matching, despite its flexibility and efficiency in attack identification, brings significantly high computation and storage complexities to NIDSes, making line-rate packet processing a challenging task. In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2244791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475958","Deep packet inspection (DPI);deterministic finite automaton (DFA);network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes);nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)","Acceleration;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Educational institutions;Engines;Memory management;Pattern matching","finite automata;security of data;string matching","NIDS;StriFA acceleration scheme;attack database;attack identification;data stream;high-speed regular expression matching;line-rate packet processing;malicious information;network intrusion detection systems;stride finite automata;string matching;traffic stream","","2","","31","","2013-03-07","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

More precisely, this paper shows how DDoS attacks can exhaust controller resources and provides a solution to detect such attacks based on the entropy variation of the destination IP address.

The coding scheme and genetic operations including selection, crossover, and mutation are discussed in detail. The IGA's local searching ability is improved by combining it with discrete gradient method. The results obtained by several tests are quite encouraging, including that the immune operator contributes much to solve the problem of premature convergence.

As control systems become increasingly complex, the number of inputs and outputs increase. Therefore, in order to maintain sufficient levels of state-awareness, a robust system state monitoring must be implemented that correctly identifies system behavior even when one or more sensors are faulty. Furthermore, as intelligent cyber adversaries become more capable, incorrect values may be fed to the operators. To address these needs, this paper proposes a fuzzyneural data fusion engine (FN-DFE) for resilient state-awareness of control systems. The designed FN-DFE is composed of a three-layered system consisting of: 1) traditional threshold based alarms; 2) anomalous behavior detector using self-organizing fuzzy logic system; and 3) artificial neural network-based system modeling and prediction. The improved control system stateawareness is achieved via fusing input data from multiple sources and combining them into robust anomaly indicators. In addition, the neural network-based signal predictions are used to augment the resiliency of the system and provide coherent state-awareness despite temporary unavailability of sensory data. The proposed system was integrated and tested with a model of the Idaho National Laboratory's hybrid energy system facility known as HYTEST. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed FNDFE provides timely plant performance monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities. It was shown that the system is capable of identifying intrusive behavior significantly earlier than conventional threshold-based alarm systems.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2323891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823672","Artificial neural networks;data fusion;fuzzy logic systems;resilient control systems;state-awareness","Artificial neural networks;Control systems;Monitoring;Robustness;Sensor systems;Vectors","control engineering computing;fuzzy neural nets;power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;sensor fusion","FN-DFE engine;HYTEST facility;Idaho National Laboratory;anomalous behavior detector;artificial neural network-based system;control system state-awareness;control systems;critical infrastructure;energy production system;enhanced resilient state-awareness;fuzzy-neural data fusion engine;hybrid energy systems;industrial system;intelligent cyber adversaries;neural network-based signal predictions;self-organizing fuzzy logic system;system modeling;system prediction;system state monitoring;threshold based alarms;threshold-based alarm systems","","3","","41","","2014-05-30","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With respect to a cognitive motivated situation like a conversation between partners, mind-maps become interesting as they are able to process stimulating signals whenever they occur.

Replication is a well-known technique to achieve fault tolerance in distributed systems, thereby enhancing availability. We propose an approach relying on replication techniques and based on monitoring information to be applied in distributed systems for fault tolerance. Our approach uses both active and passive strategies to implement an optimistic replication protocol. Using a proxy to handle service calls and relying on service replication strategies, we effectively deal with the complexity and overhead issues. This paper presents an architecture for implementing the proxy based on monitoring data and the replication management. Experimentation and application testing using an implementation of the architecture is presented. The architecture is demonstrated to be a viable technique for increasing dependability in distributed systems.","","978-1-4244-8228-3","978-1-4244-8230-6","10.1109/ICCP.2010.5606398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5606398","","Computer architecture;Containers;Distributed databases;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Security","distributed processing;software fault tolerance;system monitoring","dependable distributed system;distributed systems;fault tolerance;monitoring based replication;monitoring information;optimistic replication protocol;replication management;replication techniques;service calls;service replication","","1","","10","","","26-28 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A robot operating in WSN assisted environments can dynamically push instructions using over the air (OTA) update protocols to alter sensors to suit the requirements. In this paper, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for a WSN software update protocol is designed and simulated. When the protocol modifies the running software in a mote, the mote sends related information to the WSN sink. The IDS analyses the update phenomena of each of the motes in the network and computes an Intrusion Warning Score (IWS) that indicates a possible intrusion due to an illegitimate software update.","","","","10.1109/ICARA.2015.7081151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081151","","Protocols;Robot sensing systems;Security;Software;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;robot programming;security of data;software maintenance;system monitoring;wireless sensor networks","IDS;IWS;OTA update protocols;WSN assisted environments;WSN collaboration;WSN environments;WSN sink;WSN software update protocol;WSN software updates monitoring;illegitimate software update;intrusion detection system;intrusion warning score;mote running software;over the air update protocols;robots;wireless sensor network","","0","","33","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud Computing systems can be easily threatened by various cyber attacks, because most of Cloud Computing systems provide services to so many people who are not proven to be trustworthy. Therefore, a Cloud Computing system needs to contain some Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSs) for protecting each Virtual Machine(VM) against threats. In this case, there exists a tradeoff between the security level of the IDS and the system performance. If the IDS provide stronger security service using more rules or patterns, then it needs much more computing resources in proportion to the strength of security. So the amount of resources allocating for customers decreases. Another problem in Cloud Computing is that, huge amount of logs makes system administrators hard to analyse them. In this paper, we propose a method that enables Cloud Computing system to achieve both effectiveness of using the system resource and strength of the security service without trade-off between them.","1738-9445","978-1-4244-8830-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5745874","Cloud Computing;Cooperative IDS;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Multilevel IDS","","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","cloud computing;cyber attacks;log management;multilevel intrusion detection system;virtual machine","","8","1","8","","","13-16 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the Wired Equivalency Privacy (WEP) security protocol was broken, the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol has been considered the secure alternative compatible with hardware developed for WEP. However, in November 2008, researchers developed an attack on WPA, allowing forgery of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets. Subsequent enhancements have enabled ARP poisoning, cryptosystem denial of service, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Open source systems and methods (OSSM) have long been used to secure networks against such attacks. This article reviews OSSMs and the results of experimental attacks on WPA. These experiments re-created current attacks in a laboratory setting, recording both wired and wireless traffic. The article discusses methods of intrusion detection and prevention in the context of cyberphysical protection of critical Internet infrastructure. The basis for this research is a specialized (and undoubtedly incomplete) taxonomy of Wi-Fi attacks and their adaptations to existing countermeasures and protocol revisions. Ultimately, this article aims to provide a clearer picture of how and why wireless protection protocols and encryption must achieve a more scientific basis for detecting and preventing such attacks.","1540-7993","","","10.1109/MSP.2012.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193090","IEEE 802.11;Internet-based attacks on privacy and confidentiality;Wi-Fi protected access;attack experimentation;computer security;critical Internet infrastructure;intrusion detection and prevention","Communication system security;Encryption;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Network security;Phase shift keying;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","","","","3","","","","2012-05-01","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A class of IDSs is based on clustering of network traffic into normal and abnormal according to some features of the connections. The selected distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of sessions' features affect the performance of clustering based IDSs. The most popular distance metric, which is used in designing these IDSs is the Euclidean distance function. In this paper, we argue that more appropriate distance functions can be deployed for IDSs. We propose a method of learning an appropriate distance function according to a set of supervision information. This metric is derived by solving a semi-definite optimization problem, which attempts to decrease the distance between the similar, and increases the distances between the dissimilar feature vectors. The evaluation of this scheme over Kyoto2006+ dataset shows that the new distance metric, can improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) clustering based IDS in terms of normal detection and false positive rates.","","978-1-4799-8817-4","","10.1109/AISP.2015.7123497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123497","Anomaly detection;Clustering Algorithms;Intrusion detection system;Metric learning","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Measurement;Support vector machines;Training data","mathematical programming;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Euclidean distance function;Kyoto2006+ dataset;SVM clustering;SVM-clustering based intrusion detection system;clustering based IDS;dissimilar feature vector;distance metric;false positive rate;network security;network traffic;normal detection;semidefinite optimization problem;support vector machine clustering","","0","","14","","","3-5 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attribute independence issue associated with Naïve Bayes has been resolved through the development of the Average One Dependence Estimator (AODE) algorithm.

UDP is widely used in new P2P networks because it can provides better support for NAT traversal. Since many of these applications use private protocols, UDP traffic is often hard to analyze, especially if the available data is only netflow records. In this paper, a component based method is proposed to analyze UDP traffic. Since flows in each component share the same application, P2P traffic can be identified without packet level information.","","978-1-4799-3649-6","","10.1109/ICICIP.2014.7010349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7010349","","IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Punching;Servers","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Internet traffic;NAT traversal;Netflow based P2P detection;TCP;UDP traffic;component based method","","0","","23","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CoPNet based attack model is flexible enough to model Internet intrusion, including the static and dynamic features of the intrusion. The process and rules of building CoPNet based attack model from AT are also presented. In order to evaluate the risk of intrusion, some cost elements are added to CoPNet based attack modeling.
