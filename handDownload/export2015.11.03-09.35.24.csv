A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX). We also evaluate OMP's performance by simulations and compare it with the minimum cost planning using Dijkstra algorithm to show its advantages.","1530-2016","978-1-4244-7918-4","978-0-7695-4157-0","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599120","Disjoint Path;Maximum-Flow Minimum-Cost Planning;Smart Home;Wireless Sensor and Actor Network","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Planning;Smart homes;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","fault tolerance;home computing;path planning;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Dijkstra algorithm;Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm;Goldberg minimum cost flow algorithm;Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm;actor networks;actor nodes;expected transmission count;fault-tolerance;intrusion detection system;intrusion event notification;node-disjoint paths;optimal multipath planning;sensor nodes;smart homes;timeliness issues;wireless links;wireless sensor","","0","","18","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the contradictory requirements of immediate node failure notification and infrequent analyzer status variation should be both considered. In this contribution, we designed one heartbeat protocol with four variations in publish-subscribe framework.

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks. I will construct the secured VOIP communication over MANET area using TCP / IP and storage Data in GSM modem as SMS (inbox).

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.","","978-1-4673-6320-4","","10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581","","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training","Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection","Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction","","0","","20","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, access control mechanisms deal with allow or deny a based rule (for access to a file) which even extends to role based access control in some cases. This directly implies that access protection mechanism is generally tightly coupled with almost all operating systems. Still, intrusion is a common phenomenon. This paper analyzes and measures the performance of our previously defined approach for efficient file system intrusion detection system. This paper also establishes how this approach can be complementary to existing access control mechanism for Linux kernel 2.6.x.","","978-0-7695-4042-9","978-1-4244-6962-8","10.1109/ICCNT.2010.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474493","Access and Creation Date and Time stamp (MAC DTS);Host Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS);Loadable Kernel Module (LKM);Modification;System calls;Virtual File System (VFS)","Access control;Computer networks;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Operating systems;Performance analysis;Protection;Security","authorisation;file organisation","Linux kernel 2.6.x;access control mechanism;date stamp;file access;file creation;file modification;file system intrusion detection system;kernel level VFS logger;time stamp;virtual file system","","2","","12","","","23-25 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As different kinds of worms spread in the Internet, the interactions among them have strong impact on the propagation of worms. In order to eliminate the negative effect, it is necessary to characterize these interaction behaviors. Accounting for these factors, a model with two mutualistic symbiosis worms is proposed in this paper. The stability of the infection-free equilibrium and positive equilibrium are discussed. Through theoretical analysis, the stability conditions are obtained mathematically. Numerical results from the experiment are in favor of the theoretical analysis. It also indicates that the mutualistic symbiosis worms indeed promote each other's spread in the Internet, which is helpful to design strategies to control the spread of worms.","","978-1-4799-1390-9","","10.1109/MIC.2013.6758077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758077","mutualistic symbiosis worms;numerical simulation;propagation model;stability","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Equations;Grippers;Jacobian matrices;Mathematical model","Internet;invasive software","Internet worm attacks;infection-free equilibrium;mutualistic symbiosis worms;positive equilibrium","","0","","10","","","16-18 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem: Generally, the common practice for dealing with imbalanced data sets is to rebalance them artificially by using sampling methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier. To reduce the computational cost of selecting samples, we propose a clustering method as a first step in order to determine the critical centers, and then we select samples from those critical clusters.

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","1","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","","978-1-4244-3337-7","978-1-4244-3338-4","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","7","5","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Biologically inspired approaches to security in networks are interesting to evaluate because of the analogies between network security and survival of human body under pathogenic attacks. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network based on multiple low-cost, low-energy sensor nodes connected to physical signals. The network is made up of sensor nodes and gateways, where the server nodes acquire physical world data, while the gateway forwards the data to the end-user. While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in wireless sensor network nodes is an emerging area. This paper uses machine learning techniques to first differentiate between fraudulent and good nodes in the system. Next, it derives inspiration from the human immune system to present an idea of virtual antibodies in the system, to disable the fraudulent nodes in the system.","","978-1-4799-1414-2","","10.1109/NaBIC.2013.6617852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617852","Biologically Inspired;Human Immune System;Machine Learning;Security;WSN","Immune system;Logic gates;Skin","artificial immune systems;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless sensor networks","bio-inspired machine learning;computer networks;fraudulent nodes;good nodes;human immune system;trust;virtual antibodies;wireless sensor network security","","2","","19","","","12-14 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","978-1-4244-9879-6","978-0-7695-4330-7","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","1","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool. The web-based open platform may simplify network administration as well as promote collaborative analysis among researchers.","","","","10.1109/PacificVis.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787176","Network Anomaly Visualization","Data visualization;Image color analysis;Joining processes;Market research;Security;Servers;Visualization","Internet;computer network management;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation","IDS log;Web-based open platform;anomaly detection;collaborative analysis;faulty devices;interactive visualization;intrusion detection system log;large-scale networks;log data analysis;malicious applications;malicious users;minimum learning curve;multiple commodity visualizations;network anomaly analysis tool;network management;suspicious behavior detection;suspicious pattern detection","","1","","14","","","4-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features.

In this mode, devices are able to acquire all traffic that passes through them, independently from its destination. On a wireless network, this means that it is possible to monitor all the activities inside the device's cover range. Unfortunately, the Promiscuous mode limits the use of the device by prohibiting the association with wireless networks, or in general, sending data. This limitation restricts uses of sniffers on specific scenarios. This paper shows how to remove such limitation by presenting our Laurin Project.

The biggest challenge for today is to protect these users from any incident that can lead their mistrust towards the whole system. Intrusion is an act which is undesirable and can lead to losses in many forms of different magnitudes. IDPS (Intrusion detection and prevention) is a very important tool which not only detects the intrusion of unauthorized and suspicious activities that can compromise the security pillars (Authentication, availability, Confidentiality and Integrity) of data or information but also prevents the unexpected event. In this paper a new scheme for IDPS with the integration of Mobile Agents is proposed which looks after the anomalies and responds by taking suitable measures with the help of agents.","","978-1-4673-2981-1","","10.1109/CICN.2012.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375202","Agent;Anomaly;Anomaly Detection;IDPS;IDS;IPS;Intrusion;MAS;Mobile Agent;ourmon","Engines;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;authorisation;data integrity;data privacy;mobile agents","AgentOuro;IDPS;Internet;anomaly;attack prone user;data authentication;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;intrusion prevention system;mobile agent;novelty based intrusion detection system;security pillar;suspicious activity;unauthorized activity;user protection","","1","","28","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole. Then the performance of these attacks against the proposed algorithm has been calculated and result is displayed.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918258","Adhoc networks;Denial of service;Intrusion;Multitier;Trust;commitment","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","DSR algorithm;application layer data;application tier;data transfer;intrusion detection systems;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;muiltier intrusion detection system;routing policy;routing tier;security attack;trust tier;trusted connection;trusted multitier method","","0","","15","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This improved Apriori algorithm is considered to make the data mining process faster. Reactive policies are adopted for the detected intrusions. These policies are created based on the severity of an intrusion and an appropriate response is generated for the users who performed intrusive activity.

The model not only discovers new alert topic of local network domain, but also cooperatively schedules the information of alert case knowledge base (ACKB) between different alert monitor nodes. CATDM discovers new alert topic of each monitor node and optimizes the local ACKB periodically. Through cooperatively scheduling the information of ACKB between different alert monitor nodes, the model enables some alert monitor nodes to obtain the ability of detecting new alert topic and strengthens the detection ability of burst alert topic. To validate the performance of CATDM, we present two comparison experiments on the data corpus about Â¿campus network cultureÂ¿.

IEEE","20100304","2009","","","1","6","Local monitoring has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for mitigating security attacks in multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality. We show through analysis and simulation that the basic local monitoring (BLM) fails to efficiently mitigate stealthy power control attacks while MPC successfully mitigates them.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425559","","Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power control;Protocols;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;power control;protocols;security of data;wireless channels","MPC;basic local monitoring;malicious behavior;mitigating security attacks;mitigating stealthy power control attacks;multihop ad-hoc networks;partial neighborhood communication;protocol;stealthy packet dropping;wireless ad hoc networks","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community. An automatic rule propagation mechanism is proposed based on a decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation.

The attacker, in fact, has his own unique interests for the resources he gains access to by masquerading a legitimate user. For this reason, to learn the user specific interests will help in identifying the masqueraders. This is a new attempt. Based on the outstanding characteristics of cloud model on processing transformation between a qualitative concept and a set of quantitative numerical values, we apply cloud model to analyzing the correlation between user behaviors and user interests.

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we analyze the possibility of using data stream mining for enhancing the security of AMI through an intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a second line of defense after the primary security methods of encryption, authentication, authorization, etc. We propose a realistic and reliable IDS architecture for the whole AMI system, which consists of individual IDSs for three different levels of AMI's components: smart meter, data concentrator, and AMI headend. We also explore the performances of various existing state-of-the-art data stream mining algorithms on a publicly available IDS data set, namely, the KDD Cup 1999 data set. Then, we conduct a feasibility analysis of using these existing data stream mining algorithms, which exhibit varying levels of accuracies, memory requirements, and running times, for the distinct IDSs at AMI's three different components. Our analysis identifies different candidate algorithms for the different AMI components' IDSs, respectively.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2294120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720175","Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);data stream mining;intrusion detection system (IDS);smart grid (SG)","Computer architecture;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Smart grids","authorisation;cryptography;data mining;smart meters;smart power grids","KDD Cup 1999 data set;advanced metering infrastructure;authentication;authorization;data concentrator;data stream mining;encryption;intrusion detection system;primary security;security enhancement;smart grid;smart meter","","0","","38","","2014-01-23","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The capacity of such networks remains a fundamental obstacle toward the adaptation of sensor network systems for advanced applications that require higher data rates and throughput. In this paper, we explore potential benefits of integrating directional antennas into wireless sensor networks. While the usage of directional antennas has been investigated in the past for ad hoc networks, their usage in sensor networks bring both opportunities as well as challenges. In this paper, Sectored-Antenna Medium Access Control (SAMAC), an integrated cross-layer protocol that provides the communication mechanisms for sensor network to fully utilize sectored antennas, is introduced. Simulation studies show that SAMAC delivers high energy efficiency and predictable delay performance with graceful degradation in performance with increased load.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439005","CSMA/CA.;Sensor networks;TDMA;cross-layer protocols;directional antennas;scheduling;sectored antennas","","access protocols;directive antennas;wireless sensor networks","SAMAC;directional antennas;integrated cross-layer communication protocol;sectored-antenna medium access control;wireless sensor network system","","7","","24","","2010-03-25","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Hybrid Regular Expression Matching for Deep Packet Inspection on Multi-Core Architecture","Yan Sun; Haiqin Liu; Valgenti, V.C.; Min Sik Kim","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN), 2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on","20100902","2010","","","1","7","Many network security applications in today's networks are based on deep packet inspection, checking not only the header portion but also the payload portion of a packet. For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing NFA/DFA and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well on the important issues on multi-core architecture design, such as load balancing, data locality and communication between cores.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-7114-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560073","","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Multicore processing;Program processors","computer viruses;finite automata;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","attack signatures;data locality;deep packet inspection;hybrid regular expression matching;layer-7 filtering;load balancing;multicore architecture;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection;payload portion;space complexity;traffic monitoring;viruses","","3","1","27","","","2-5 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
