CompactDFA: Scalable Pattern Matching Using Longest Prefix Match Solutions,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya, Israel","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20140417,2014,22,2,415,428,"A central component in all contemporary intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is their pattern matching algorithms, which are often based on constructing and traversing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that represents the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

Scalable Packet Classification for Datacenter Networks,Pi-Chung Wang,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Nat. Chung Hsing Univ., Taichung, Taiwan","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20131219,2014,32,1,124,137,"The key challenge to a datacenter network is its scalability to handle many customers and their applications. In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489,Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability,Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software,computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines,VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty,,1,,48,,,Jan-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine
An Alert Correlation Method Based on Improved Cluster Algorithm,Xi Peng; Yugang Zhang; Shisong Xiao; Zheng Wu; Jianqun Cui; Limiao Chen; Debao Xiao,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Huazhong Normal Univ., Wuhan","Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application, 2008. PACIIA '08. Pacific-Asia Workshop on",20090120,2008,1,,342,347,"In the past several years, the alert correlation methods have been advocated to discover high-level attack scenarios by correlating the low-level alerts. The causal correlation method based on prerequisites and consequences has great advantages in the process of correlating alerts. But it must depend on complicated background knowledge base and has some limits in discovering new attacks. The cluster can aggregate the relational alerts by computing the similarity between alert attributes, as well as can discover new and simple high-level attacks. However, it is difficult to establish the attribute weights in the similarity membership function of two alerts and the threshold of classification similarity value. In order to solve the problem, the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights and similarity value. In view of the advantages and disadvantages of cluster and correlation, this paper uses improved cluster algorithm to optimize correlation in the process of attack detection. The experimental results on LLS DDoS1.0 prove that the method proposed is useful and effective.",,978-0-7695-3490-9,,10.1109/PACIIA.2008.285,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756579,Alert;Cluster;Correlation;QPSO,Application software;Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer industry;Computer science;Conferences;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Particle swarm optimization,particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering;security of data,LLS DDoS1.0;alert correlation method;attack detection;cluster algorithm;quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm;similarity membership function,,1,,23,,,19-20 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This survey article presents a number of frequently used and useful probabilistic techniques. Bloom filters and their variants are of prime importance, and they are heavily used in various distributed systems. This has been reflected in recent research and many new algorithms have been proposed for distributed systems that are either directly or indirectly based on Bloom filters.
