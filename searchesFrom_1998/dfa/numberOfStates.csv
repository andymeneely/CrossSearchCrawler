Incorporating soft computing techniques into a probabilistic intrusion detection system,Sung-Bae Cho,"Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) that models normal behaviors with hidden Markov models (HMM) and attempts to detect intrusions by noting significant deviations from the models. Among several soft computing techniques neural network and fuzzy logic are incorporated into the system to achieve robustness and flexibility. The self-organizing map (SOM) determines the optimal measures of audit data and reduces them into appropriate size for efficient modeling by HMM. Based on several models with different measures, fuzzy logic makes the final decision of whether current behavior is abnormal or not. Experimental results with some real audit data show that the proposed fusion produces a viable intrusion detection system. Fuzzy rules that utilize the models based on the measures of system call, file access, and the combination of them produce more reliable performance.",1094-6977,,,10.1109/TSMCC.2002.801356,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039199,,Computer industry;Computer networks;Current measurement;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Robustness;Size measurement;Uncertainty,fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;probability;security of data;self-organising feature maps;uncertainty handling,anomaly detection;audit data;experimental results;file access;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;hard computing;hidden Markov models;imprecision;industrial applications;neural network;performance;probabilistic intrusion detection system;robustness;self-organizing map;soft computing;system call;uncertainty,,33,,20,,,May-02,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks. The DFA based pattern matching methods are fast enough but require more memory. However, NFA based pattern matching methods are comparatively takes less memory but the speed of matching is very slow, to overcome these drawbacks of finite automata there are many approaches have been proposed.

Virtualization technology is another technology which goes along with the cloud environment which is used most widely to reduce the cost purchasing the hardware infrastructures in organizations. Henceforth, the Cloud Computing Systems can be easily intruded by various types of cyber attacks including Denial of Serv-ice (DoS) attack and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which utilize the entire resources like CPU, Memory, etc and makes the server to starve. This creates a major impact reducing the efficiency of the virtual machines. In the proposed method, attack can be overcome by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Mitigation Strategy which uses the SYN Cookie to prevent the attack in the cloud to prevent the attack in which the server ignores the connection packets when it does not receive the correct Acknowledgement (ACK) from the client which requested the connection. The server here has rules to be check whether it is a legitimate client or the spoofed one using the first layer of security for hop count filtering mechanism and second layer of security is encoding the sequence number of the SYN packet so that only a legitimate client can decode it.

We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

CompactDFA: Scalable Pattern Matching Using Longest Prefix Match Solutions,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Interdiscipl.

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps.

Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means.

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs.

Since most of the known attacks can be represented with strings or combinations of multiple substrings, string matching is a key component, as well as the bottleneck in NIDS to address the requirement of constantly increasing capacity. We propose a memory-efficient multiple-character-approaching architecture consisting of multiple parallel deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called TDP-DFA. By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity. We also present a novel scheme to share the storage of transition rules among multiple DFAs, substantially decreasing the total storage cost, and avoiding the cost increase being proportional to the number of DFAs. We evaluate this design through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments.

An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities.

These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.",,0-7695-1874-5,,10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909,,Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance,Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models,Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets,,15,,30,,,6-9 Jan. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction.

We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(||p<sup>2</sup>(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where  is the alphabet and c  1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-9919-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986,Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching,NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,,11,,26,,,10-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
TFA: A Tunable Finite Automaton for Pattern Matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Yang Xu; Junchen Jiang; Rihua Wei; Yang Song; Chao, H.J.","Polytech.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778,Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion,Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management,finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data,Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton,,0,,25,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

In this paper, we propose a regex pattern grouping scheme based on a new DFA model called Pattern-Based DFA (P-DFA) which supports efficient pattern-based op-erations, such as insertion, deletion, and etc. By using these basic operations, one can easily measure the state explo-sion when combining a set of regex patterns into a single DFA.

To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems.

A high throughput string matching architecture for intrusion detection and prevention,"Lin Tan; Sherwood, T.","Dept. of Comput.

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule.

Robust and Fast Pattern Matching for Intrusion Detection,"Namjoshi, K.; Narlikar, G.","Bell Labs., Alcatel-Lucent, Paris, France","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE",20100506,2010,,,1,9,"The rule language of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a critical role in its effectiveness. A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions.

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a Union then Minimize framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a Minimize then Union framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers.

Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Computers, IEEE Transactions on",20120524,2012,61,7,1013,1025,"We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a high-performance architecture for regular expression matching (REM) on field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Each regular expression (regex) is first parsed into a concise token list representation, then compiled to a modular nondeterministic finite automaton (RE-NFA) using a modified version of the McNaughton-Yamada algorithm. The RE-NFA can be mapped directly onto a compact register-transistor level (RTL) circuit. A number of optimizations are applied to improve the circuit performance: 1) spatial stacking is used to construct an REM circuit processing m  1 input characters per clock cycle; 2) single-character constrained repetitions are matched efficiently by parallel shift-register lookup tables; 3) complex character classes are matched by a BRAM-based classifier shared across regexes; 4) a multipipeline architecture is used to organize a large number of RE-NFAs into priority groups to limit the I/O size of the circuit. We implemented 2,630 unique PCRE regexes from Snort rules (February 2010) in the proposed REM architecture. Based on the place-and-route results from Xilinx ISE 11.1 targeting Virtex5 LX-220 FPGAs, the proposed REM architecture achieved up to 11 Gbps concurrent throughput for various regex sets and up to 2.67 the throughput efficiency of other state-of-the-art designs.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2011.129,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959160,BRAM;FPGA;LUT;NFA;Regular expression;SRL.;finite state machine;network intrusion detection,Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic gates;Table lookup;Throughput,circuit optimisation;clocks;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;logic design;network routing;parallel architectures;performance evaluation;pipeline processing;shift registers;table lookup,BRAM-based classifier;McNaughton-Yamada algorithm;REM architecture;REM circuit processing;Snort rules;Virtex5 LX-220 FPGAs;Xilinx ISE 11.1;compact architecture;compact register-transistor level circuit;complex character classes;field-programmable gate array;high-performance architecture;modular nondeterministic finite automaton;multipipeline architecture;parallel shift-register lookup tables;regular expression matching;single-character constrained repetitions;spatial stacking;state-of-the-art designs,,4,1,20,,7/21/2011,Jul-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Hardware implementation for scalable lookahead Regular Expression detection,"Bando, M.; Artan, N.S.; Mehta, N.; Yi Guan; Chao, H.J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Polytech.

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine.

In this paper, a new efficient intrusion detection method based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) is presented. HMMs are applied to model the normal program behaviors using traces of system calls issued by processes. The output probability of a sequence of system calls is calculated by the normal model built. If the probability of a sequence in a trace is below a certain threshold, the sequence is flagged as a mismatch.

Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification.

Ultra-high throughput string matching for Deep Packet Inspection,"Kennedy, A.; Xiaojun Wang; Zhen Liu; Bin Liu","Sch. of Electron.

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets.

Scalable multi-pipeline architecture for high performance multi-pattern string matching,"Weirong Jiang; Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as virus free by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048  128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area.

An analytical framework for reasoning about intrusions,"Upadhyaya, S.; Ramkumar Chinchani; Kwiaty, K.","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings. 20th IEEE Symposium on",20020806,2001,,,99,108,"Local and wide area network information assurance analysts need current and precise knowledge about their system activities in order to address the challenges of critical infrastructure protection. In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance. Our main result is the modeling of user activity on a computing system as a martingale and the subsequent quantification of the cost of performing a job to enable decision making",1060-9857,0-7695-1366-2,,10.1109/RELDIS.2001.969760,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969760,,Costs;Delay;Encapsulation;Fault detection;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal resolution;Wide area networks;Yarn,computer network management;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;safety systems;system recovery,active response;analytical framework;cost analysis;critical infrastructure protection;decision making;error detection;intrusion detection solutions;intrusion signaling;martingale;network information assurance analysts;real-time assessment scheme;reasoning framework;recovery thread;system activities;user activity modeling,,5,,15,,,2001,28 Oct 2001-31 Oct 2001,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper, by exploiting the location history traversed by a mobile user, two domain-independent online anomaly detection schemes are designed, namely the Lempel-Ziv (LZ)-based and Markov-based detection schemes. The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

CompactDFA: Generic State Machine Compression for Scalable Pattern Matching,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

The collected system calls are treated as signals which are used to reconstruct the system's phase space.

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive.

In recent years, the HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. Due to the high false alarm rate in the classical IDS based on HMM, this paper proposes a Fuzzy approach to the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), called Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models (FHMM). It is introduced with the Fuzzy logic. The system has the simplicity and flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the IDS based on FHMM, its robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. For these reasons, a new intrusion detection method based on FHMM was proposed in this paper. The proposed method differs from STIDE in that only one profile is created for the normal behavior of all applications using short sequences of system calls issued by the normal runs of the programs. Subsequent to this, HMM with simple states along with STIDE is used to categorize an unknown programpsilas sequence of system calls to be either normal or an intrusion.

Classification of Disturbances and Cyber-Attacks in Power Systems Using Heterogeneous Time-Synchronized Data,"Shengyi Pan; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.","Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS, USA","Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on",20150602,2015,11,3,650,662,"Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.",1551-3203,,,10.1109/TII.2015.2420951,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776,Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining,Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements,data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion,classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs,,0,,34,,4/8/2015,Jun-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

In this paper, a kind of hardware based compact DFA structure for multiple regexes matching called CPDFA is presented. According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not.

This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead.

In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination.

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults.

Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a content-less identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput.

We argue that monitoring and anomaly detection are necessary mechanisms for ensuring secure and dependable network computing infrastructure. The model for network traffic exchange is based on a modified Ehrenfest urn model and combines statistical physics and queuing theory to provide macrostate descriptions of complex networked systems when the exact microstate parameters of each element in the system precludes global understanding from first principles.

Heterogeneous learning in zero-sum stochastic games with incomplete information,"Quanyan Zhu; Tembine, H.; Basar, T.","Dept.

In dynamic and decentralized settings where the traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents. In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics.

String matching circuits have been studied extensively for intrusion detection systems. An NFA-based string matching circuit, one of the works, has expandability of the processing data width. Due to the huge hardware requirement, it was difficult to implement an NFA-based string matching circuit with the whole Snort 2.3.3 rule (35461 characters) that processes at 10 Gbps on a single FPGA. To reduce the circuit area, we eliminate redundant states of the NFA with the Aho-Corasick approach and redundant AND-gates in the NFA. Consequently, our method reduces the resource requirements by over 50% as compared with previous NFA-based circuits, and the synthesis result shows that a matching circuit that includes the whole Snort 2.3.3 rule can be implemented onto a single Xilinx Virtex-II pro xc2vp-100 with throughput over 10 Gbps",,1-4244-0312-X,,10.1109/FPL.2006.311317,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101079,,Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Data processing;Electronics industry;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Industrial electronics;Intrusion detection;Network synthesis;Throughput,field programmable gate arrays;logic design;security of data,10 Gbit/s;Aho-Corasick approach;FPGA;Snort 2.3.3 rule;Xilinx Virtex-II pro xc2vp-100;field programmable gate arrays;intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automation;redundant AND-gates;scalable NFA-based string matching circuit,,0,1,8,,,28-30 Aug. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated.

Zebu: A Language-Based Approach for Network Protocol Message Processing,"Burgy, L.; Reveillere, L.; Lawall, J.; Muller, G.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20110728,2011,37,4,575,591,"A network application communicates with other applications according to a set of rules known as a protocol. This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.",0098-5589,,,10.1109/TSE.2010.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528,Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing,Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server,Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing,ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols,,5,,34,,6/17/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability.

We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint.

Reorganized and Compact DFA for Efficient Regular Expression Matching,Kai Wang; Yaxuan Qi; Yibo Xue; Jun Li,,"Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on",20110728,2011,,,1,5,"Regular expression matching has become a critical yet challenging technique in content-aware network processing, such as application identification and deep inspection. To meet the requirement for processing heavy network traffic at line rate, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is widely used to accelerate regular expression matching at the expense of large memory usage. In this paper, we propose a DFA-based algorithm named RCDFA (Reorganized and Compact DFA), which dramatically reduces the memory usage while maintaining fast and deterministic lookup speed. Based on the dissection of real-life DFA tables, we observe that almost every state has multiple similar states, i.e. they share identical next-state transitions for most input characters. However, these similar states often distribute at nonadjacent positions in the original DFA table. RCDFA aims at reorganizing all similar states into adjacent entries, so that identical transitions become consecutive along the state dimension, then compresses the reorganized DFA table utilizing bitmap technique. Coupled with mapping along the character dimension, RCDFA is not only efficient in DFA compression, but also effective for hardware implementation. Experiment results show, RCDFA has superior performance in terms of high processing speed, low memory usage and short preprocessing time. RCDFA consistently achieves over 95% compression ratio for existing real-life rule sets.

And in many pragmatic applications string pattern matching is the most compute intensive task which takes majority processing time, therefore, in order to improve system efficiency many works have been done around hardware implementation of regular expression matching. However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably. Analyzed by XPower, which offered by Xilinx Inc., our approach is able to save dynamic power consumption by1.7 times comparing to traditional approaches on Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device.",,978-1-4577-1006-3,978-0-7695-4466-3,10.1109/GreenCom.2011.39,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061325,FPGA;NFA;power efficient accelerator;regular expression matching,Clocks;Computer architecture;Hardware;Logic gates;Pattern matching;Radiation detectors;Random access memory,field programmable gate arrays;string matching,PeRex;Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device;XPower;Xilinx Inc;dynamic power consumption;power efficient FPGA-based architecture;power efficient regular expression matching architecture;string pattern matching,,1,,19,,,4-5 Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection,"Ye, N.; Yebin Zhang; Borror, C.M.","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20040405,2004,53,1,116,123,"Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.",0018-9529,,,10.1109/TR.2004.823851,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169,,Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing,Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security,Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size,,38,1,56,,,Mar-04,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own.

In this sense, system functionalities are captured as UML use cases, and Petri nets are used as the main modeling formalism. The system's model is built upon each use case and its translation into a state diagram or Petri net model.

Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think,"Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.",,"Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,185,190,"A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.",,,,10.1109/SPW.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302,,Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches,Internet;finite state machines;protocols,FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications,,0,,9,,,17-18 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Trust Management for Encounter-Based Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks,Ing-Ray Chen; Fenye Bao; MoonJeong Chang; Jin-Hee Cho,"Dept. of Comput.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235,,Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols,Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes,DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol,,21,,15,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - naive Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as normal or anomalous to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification.

However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds.

A workload for evaluating deep packet inspection architectures,"Becchi, M.; Franklin, M.; Crowley, P.","Comput. Sci. & Eng. Dept., Washington Univ. in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO","Workload Characterization, 2008. IISWC 2008. IEEE International Symposium on",20080930,2008,,,79,89,"High-speed content inspection of network traffic is an important new application area for programmable networking systems, and has recently led to several proposals for high-performance regular expression matching. At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).",,978-1-4244-2777-2,978-1-4244-2778-9,10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093,,Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system,,20,1,28,,,14-16 Sept. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In addition, current software becomes increasingly more complex and difficult to handle even for security experts. Intrusion Detection Softwares (IDS) represent a solution that can alleviate these concerns. This paper proposes a framework to automatically build an effective online IDS which can check if the program's expected behavior is respected during the execution. The proposed framework extracts relevant information from the program's source code to build a dedicated IDS. We use the GCC compiler to produce the structure of our behavior's model and ensure the IDS is correct. Thanks to Petri nets, our framework allows program offline monitoring and simplifies the online monitoring development.",1074-6005,0-7695-2834-1,,10.1109/RSP.2007.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228491,,Computer languages;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Information security;Intrusion detection;Petri nets;Prototypes;Software prototyping,Petri nets;program compilers;program verification;safety-critical software;security of data;software prototyping;system monitoring,GCC compiler;Petri net;intrusion detection system;online monitoring development;program offline monitoring;rapid prototyping;security software design,,0,,18,,,28-30 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Multi-byte Pattern Matching Using Stride-K DFA for High Speed Deep Packet Inspection,"Najam, M.; Younis, U.; Rasool, R.U.","Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci. (SEECS), Nat. Univ. of Sci. & Technol. (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan","Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), 2014 IEEE 17th International Conference on",20150129,2014,,,547,553,"Deep packet inspection (DPI) is one of the crucial tasks in modern intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems. It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.",,978-1-4799-7980-6,,10.1109/CSE.2014.125,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635,DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions,Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data,ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching,,0,,24,,,19-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
