DFA-Based Regular Expression Matching on Compressed Traffic,Yan Sun; Min Sik Kim,"Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on",20110728,2011,,,1,5,"Many network security applications in today's networks are based on deep packet inspection, checking not only the header portion but also the payload portion of a packet. For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The evaluation results show that our approach can reduce the number of state access in the DFA significantly.",1550-3607,978-1-61284-232-5,978-1-61284-231-8,10.1109/icc.2011.5962596,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962596,,Automata;Computers;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads,computer network security;deterministic automata;finite automata,DFA-based regular expression matching;Snort;compressed traffic;deep packet inspection;layer-7 filtering;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection system;rule sets;traffic monitoring,,1,,25,,,5-9 June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
A Memory Efficient Multiple Pattern Matching Architecture for Network Security,Tian Song; Wei Zhang; Dongsheng Wang; Yibo Xue,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters. A single architecture is memory efficient for large pattern set, and it is possible to support more than 10 M patterns with at most half amount of the memory utilization compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-2025-4,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.42,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509637,,Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching,cache storage;computer networks;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security,ACC algorithm;cached deterministic finite automate;computer network security;content inspection based application;memory efficient multiple pattern matching architecture;next-state addressing scheme,,21,3,23,,,13-18 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways. First of all, it provides a sophisticated language to describe multistep attacks in terms of states and transitions. In addition, the modular nature of the system supports the integrated analysis of network traffic sent to the server host, operating system-level audit data produced by the server host, and the access logs produced by the Web server.

The proposed concept is based on a distributed network intrusion detection system (D-NIDS) integrated as a pump-in-the-stack process, based on a simplified open source network stack (light weight IP-lwIP). The small process-footprint (multi or single threaded) makes this solution suitable for all platforms and operating systems. Thus, embedded systems as well as high performance PCs or workstations may run this service without operating expense. The proposed solution differs from other solutions by a simple installation process-since no interactions are existing between the host- and the NIDS-stack- and the ability to run applications on top of the IDS (e.g. alluring-systems or sandbox systems). But the main idea is to take advantage of a mechanism known as state-transition intrusion detection and the integration of this mechanism into the network stack. The usage of state-transition based signatures can reduce large database entries and allows the reuse of already existing network stacks.

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure.

An Intrusion Detection System for Suburban Ad-hoc Networks,"Islam, M.M.; Pose, R.; Kopp, C.","Sch. of Comput.

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically. We show the effectiveness of SAHN-IDS through simulations.",,0-7803-9311-2,,10.1109/TENCON.2005.300979,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085224,,Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Degradation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;directive antennas;telecommunication security;wireless channels,anomaly detection;directional antennas;frequency channels;intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;suburban ad-hoc networks;transmission channel;transmission power,,1,,22,,,21-24 Nov. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings.

Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks. The DFA based pattern matching methods are fast enough but require more memory.

The state transition technique is applied to a suitably defined process state, identified by certain classes of user credential values. A transition takes place when these values change from one class to another. These states are clearly defined, and prohibited state transitions as well as some supporting rules are identified. When many break-ins succeed, either the rules are violated or these prohibited transitions occur, and this implies a violation of system security policy. A specially modified system call, ktrace0, is used by the superuser to monitor the process-state and state transition analysis is applied to the traced information, by the Intrusion Detection System.

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks.

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.",,978-1-4799-7980-6,,10.1109/CSE.2014.125,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635,DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions,Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data,ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching,,0,,24,,,19-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes.

These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft.

In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements.

Two-tier data-driven intrusion detection for automatic generation control in smart grid,"Ali, M.Q.; Yousefian, R.; Al-Shaer, E.; Kamalasadan, S.; Quanyan Zhu","Dept. of Software & Inf.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

Conservative vs. Optimistic Parallelization of Stateful Network Intrusion Detection,"Schuff, D.L.; Yung Ryn Choe; Pai, V.S.","Purdue Univ. West Lafayette, West Lafayette, IN","Performance Analysis of Systems and software, 2008. ISPASS 2008. IEEE International Symposium on",20080507,2008,,,32,43,"This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).",,978-1-4244-2232-6,978-1-4244-2233-3,10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736,,Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn,computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols,TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion,,4,,22,,,20-22 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities.

Unlike the common belief that IDS should be executed as often as possible to cope with insider attacks to prolong the system lifetime, we discover that IDS should be executed at an optimal rate in order to maximize the system lifetime. Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used. We develop mathematical models based on stochastic petri nets to identify the optimal rate for IDS execution to maximize the mean time to security failure of the system, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational conditions and attacker behaviors.",,978-0-7695-3448-0,978-0-7695-3448-0,10.1109/PRDC.2008.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725308,host-based IDS;intrusion detection;mean time to security failure;mission-oriented group communication systems;mobile ad hoc networks;voting-based IDS,Bandwidth;Batteries;Communication system security;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks,Petri nets;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security,attacker behavior;intrusion detection system technique;mathematical model;mission-oriented mobile group system;mobile ad hoc network;operational condition;stochastic petri net;system failure definition;system lifetime maximization,,0,,28,,,15-17 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Obtaining an optimal IDS configuration for effective detection of attacks is far from trivial. There exists a tradeoff between security enforcement levels and the performance of information systems. It is critical to configure an IDS in a dynamic and iterative fashion to balance the security overhead and system performance. In this paper, we use noncooperative game approaches to address this problem. We first build a fundamental game framework to model the zero-sum interactions between the detector and the attacker. Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players. An optimal policy-based configuration can be found by minimizing a discounted cost criterion, using an iterative method. In addition, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal game values when the transitions between system states are unknown.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Pattern matching is a major task in deep packet inspection. The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well.

For example, an attacker may send forged packets to a router with the intention of changing or corrupting the routing table, which in turn can reduce the network connectivity and degrade the router functionalities. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like firewall, authentication mechanisms and intrusion detection system (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect network connectivity offered by routers. In this paper, we propose using honeypot to protect routing protocols. Honeypot is particularly useful to attract attackers, driving them away real routers and allowing the administrators to be aware about intrusion attempts on their networks and the employed techniques that can be recent. Our solution (honeypot router) is to deploy a honeypot playing the role of a router. The honeypot is based on routing software called Quagga and other tools for traffic capture and analysis.

In our scenario, agents perform possibly different independent tasks, but cooperate to guarantee the entire system's safety. Indeed, agents plan their next actions by following a set of logic rules which is shared among them. Such rules are decentralized, i.e. they depend only on configurations of neighboring agents. However, some agents may not be acting according to this cooperation protocol, due to spontaneous failure or tampering. To detect such misbehaviors, we propose a solution where each agent runs a local monitor that uses only locally available information.

Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second.

Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification.

The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that focused on filesystem attack activity after a SSH compromise.

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.",,978-1-4577-1454-2,978-0-7695-4521-9,10.1109/ANCS.2011.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710,Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching,Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security,buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching,AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection,,0,,12,,,3-4 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The architecture uses a modular design to promote a high degree of flexibility. This supports creation of an environment in which state-of-the-art intrusion detection algorithms easily can be inserted. The modular design also allows for detection algorithms to be enabled and disabled when required. Additionally, the architecture uses a sensor reconfiguration mechanism to affect the amount of data collected. When a detection algorithm is enabled or disabled, the sensor providing the input data to the algorithm is correspondingly reconfigured. This implies a minimum of excess collected data.

Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata,"Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(||p<sup>2</sup>(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where  is the alphabet and c  1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA.

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying blindspots in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.",1063-9527,978-0-7695-3060-4,,10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976,,Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing,data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data,attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing,,1,,30,,,10-14 Dec. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator.

For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated.

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM.

Hybrid Regular Expression Matching for Deep Packet Inspection on Multi-Core Architecture,"Yan Sun; Haiqin Liu; Valgenti, V.C.; Min Sik Kim","Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system.

Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels.

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule.

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors.

After this work, pattern matching for this buffer is done. Finally, for the purpose of the next packet, the partial region of the current packet is stored into the packet-matching-buffer. With the help of these steps, there are two advantages. The one is that it doesn't need to re-assemble all fragment packets for intrusion detection.

Hardware implementation for scalable lookahead Regular Expression detection,"Bando, M.; Artan, N.S.; Mehta, N.; Yi Guan; Chao, H.J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Polytech. Inst. of NYU, Brooklyn, NY, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on",20100524,2010,,,1,8,"Regular Expressions (RegExes) are widely used in various applications to identify strings of text. Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.",,978-1-4244-6533-0,,10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750,,Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput,field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data,DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection,,2,,28,,,19-23 April 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

These rules can be used to detect anomalous behavior. In order to realize the quick detection of known intrusion, an engine of quick detection inspired by hidden markov model was presented in this paper.

This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.",1530-2075,978-1-4244-6442-5,,10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374,DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching,Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput,field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching,Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture,,2,,21,,,19-23 April 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols.

Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods.

Therefore, the software remains vulnerable to attacks which are handled by issuing patches or service packs by the software vendors. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed to take security into consideration right from the very beginning of the software development process. However, most specification languages were not designed with an intention for specifying security requirements, and therefore, they lack some features to serve this purpose. As a result, we need suitable specification languages that can be used both for functional specification and security specification. We propose a formal extension of a popular specification language called AsmL (Abstract State Machine Language) for attack descriptions with a view to building secure software.

In order to simplify the training procedure of the model and to improve its response performance warning events are classified into different types at first. Then the sequences of warning event types from different network monitors are correlated and their inherent relationship is mined so as to detect the type of complicate network attacks and to forecast their threat degree to the system. The experimental results show that the proposed model could recognize complicate network attacks effectively.,,978-1-4244-5850-9,,10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541790,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541790,hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;network;network attacks,Computer crime;Error analysis;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Probability distribution,,,,1,,8,,,25-27 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures.

Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection,"Ye, N.; Yebin Zhang; Borror, C.M.","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20040405,2004,53,1,116,123,"Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.",0018-9529,,,10.1109/TR.2004.823851,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169,,Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing,Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security,Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size,,38,1,56,,,Mar-04,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Control theoretic approach to intrusion detection using a distributed hidden Markov model,"Khanna, R.; Huaping Liu","INTEL Corp., Santa Clara, CA","Wireless Communications, IEEE",20080815,2008,15,4,24,33,"Cooperative ad hoc wireless networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks than traditional wired networks. Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine.

A stochastic approximation approach for improving intrusion detection data fusion structures,"Manousakis, K.; Sterne, D.; Ivanic, N.; Lawler, G.; McAuley, A.","Telcordia Technol., Piscataway, NJ, USA","Military Communications Conference, 2008. MILCOM 2008. IEEE",20090119,2008,,,1,7,"A variety of attacks on MANET routing, forwarding, and infrastructure protocols can only be detected using distributed cooperative algorithms. One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.",,978-1-4244-2676-8,978-1-4244-2677-5,10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175,,Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security,ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework,,5,,14,,,16-19 Nov. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power.

Resilient PHEV charging policies under price information attacks,"Yifan Li; Ran Wang; Ping Wang; Niyato, D.; Saad, W.; Zhu Han","Sch. of Comput. Eng., Nanyang Technol.

On the one hand, the PHEV owner needs to charge its PHEV through the grid, given possibly time-varying electricity pricing schemes. On the other hand, the energy stored in a PHEV can also be sold back to the grid so as to act as an ancillary service while possibly generating revenues to its owner. Consequently, this motivates the need to develop smart charging policies that enable the PHEV owner to optimally decide on when to charge or discharge its vehicle, while minimizing its long-term energy consumption cost. In this paper, we model this PHEV energy management problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved by using a linear programming (LP) technique so as to obtain the optimal charging policy. In particular, we devise optimal charging policies that are resilient to the price information attacks such as denial of service (DoS) attacks and price manipulation attacks over the grid's communication network. We show that, under potential price information attacks, each PHEV can optimize its charging policies given only an estimated price information, which leads to a discrepancy between the real and expected costs. To this end, we analyze this cost difference using the proposed MDP model, which can also guide the system designer and administrator to decide whether reinforcing the system's security is required. The simulation results show that the proposed PHEV charging policy is effective and is adaptable to different PHEV mobility patterns, battery levels and varying electricity prices. It is also demonstrated that improving the system's ability to detect and resolve the attack can obviously reduce the impact brought by the attacks.",,978-1-4673-0910-3,978-1-4673-0909-7,10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486015,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486015,,Batteries;Discharges (electric);Electricity;Energy consumption;Positron emission tomography;Pricing;Roads,Markov processes;battery powered vehicles;energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles;linear programming;power engineering computing;pricing;smart power grids,DoS attacks;G2V communications;LP technique;MDP;Markov decision process;V2G communications;administrator;ancillary service;battery levels;bidirectional energy flow;denial of service attacks;energy management problem;grid communication network;grid-to-vehicle communications;linear programming technique;long-term energy consumption cost minimization;mobility patterns;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;power grids;price information attacks;price manipulation attacks;resilient PHEV charging policies;smart charging policies;smart grid;system designer;system security;time-varying electricity pricing schemes;vehicle-to-grid communications,,3,,11,,,5-8 Nov. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The proposed approach scales up the balance detection rates for different types of network intrusions, and keeps the false positives at acceptable level in network intrusion detection. The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result. The performance of the proposed algorithm tested by employing KDD99 benchmark network intrusion detection dataset, and the experimental results proved that it improves the detection rates as well as reduces the false positives for different types of network intrusions.",,,,10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.6997324,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997324,boosting;intrusion detection;nave Bayesian classifier,Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Niobium,data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,KDD99 dataset;adaptive network intrusion detection;conditional probability;false positive reduction;intrusion detection learning algorithm;naive Bayesian classifier;network logs similarity;network mining;pattern clustering;supervised learning process;unsupervised learning process,,0,,35,,,8-10 March 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Proceedings,20030225,2002,2,,1503,1508 vol.2,"Traditional intrusion detection systems can be broadly classified as misuse and anomaly detectors. Misuse detectors attempt detection by matching the current system/user activity against known signatures and patterns. As opposed to this, anomaly detection works by developing a reference graph and comparing the ongoing activity against it. Any significant deviation is flagged as an intrusion. Anomaly detection is more promising because of its potential to detect unseen types of attacks. However, both techniques have conventionally relied on audit trails sampled deep inside the system via probes and the sheer size of the data allows only after-the-fact and off line detection. In recent past, there have been efforts to capture the semantics of system activity for more rapid detection and this can typically be done at levels closer to the user. In our earlier works related to this effort, we presented a scheme and a reasoning framework to detect intrusions based on the encapsulated user intent. This paper addresses the scalability and implementation aspects of the system by introducing concepts such as workspaces and meta-operations. Although this security system is a general anomaly detection system, it is amenable to operator fault recovery.

In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching.

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack.

The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy.

Image Comput., Northeastern Univ., Shenyang, China","Systems and Informatics (ICSAI), 2012 International Conference on",20120625,2012,,,1517,1521,"In this paper, a delayed worm propagation model with birth and death rates is discussed. The number of system reinstallations may be increased when the hosts get unstable (infected or quarantined). In view of such situation, dynamic birth and death rates are introduced. Afterwards, the stability of the positive equilibrium is studied. Through the theoretical analysis, it is proved that the model is locally asymptotically stable without time delay. Moreover, a bifurcation appears when time delay t passes a constant value which means that the worm propagation system is unstable and uncontrollable. Thus, the time delay should be decreased in order to predict or eliminate the worm propagation. Finally, a numeric simulation is presented which fully supports our analysis.",,978-1-4673-0198-5,,10.1109/ICSAI.2012.6223326,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223326,bifurcation;birth and death rates;time delay;worm propagation,Bifurcation;Computational modeling;Delay effects;Educational institutions;Grippers;Mathematical model;Stability analysis,asymptotic stability;delays;invasive software,bifurcation;birth rates;death rates;delayed worm propagation model;positive equilibrium;stability;system reinstallations;theoretical analysis;time delay,,0,,9,,,19-20 May 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
A Semi-Markov Survivability Evaluation Model for Intrusion Tolerant Real-Time Database Systems,Changqing Chen; Weimin Wu; Heng Zhou; Gang Shen,"Huazhong Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Wuhan, China","Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing (WiCOM), 2011 7th International Conference on",20111010,2011,,,1,4,"With the application of real-time databases and the intrusion of malicious transactions, it has become increasingly important to model the ability of real-time database intrusion tolerance and effectively evaluate its survivability. Based on the features of transaction and data for real-time database system, an intrusion tolerant architecture has been proposed for real-time database system. Considering factors such as intrusion detection latency and a variety of parameters for real-time, Semi-Markov evaluation model for survival assessment is established. Based on this model, relevant quantitative criteria are made to define the important indicators of survivability, such as integrity and availability, so as to validate intrusion detection capability and the survivability of real-time database. The three important factors of false alarm, detection rate and the intensity of attack are analyzed in detail by the TPC-C benchmark. Experiments show that the model can accurately predict the behavior of real-time database. The real-time database following the model can still provide essential services when facing attacks and the basic survival characteristics will not be seriously affected.",2161-9646,978-1-4244-6250-6,,10.1109/wicom.2011.6040583,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6040583,,Database systems;Maintenance engineering;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Steady-state,information retrieval systems;information services;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication network reliability,TPC-C benchmark;essential services;false alarm;intrusion tolerant real-time database system;quantitative criteria;real-time database intrusion tolerance;semiMarkov survivability evaluation model;survivability,,0,,8,,,23-25 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Timed Coloured Petri Net Model for Misuse Intrusion Detection,"Srinivasan, N.; Vaidehi, V.","Dept. of Inf. Technol., Anna Univ., Chennai","Industrial and Information Systems, First International Conference on",20070529,2006,,,550,555,"Misuse detection is the process of attempting to identify instances of network attacks by comparing current activity against the expected actions of an intruder. Most current approaches to misuse detection involve the use of rule-based expert systems to identify indications of known attacks. However, these techniques are less successful in identifying attacks which vary from expected patterns. This paper presents a general model based on timed coloured Petri net, capable of handling patterns generated to model the attack behavior as sequence of events. This model also allows flagging an attack, when the behavior of one or more processes matches the attack behavior.

Intrusion Detection for Encrypted Web Accesses,"Yamada, A.; Miyake, Y.; Takemori, K.; Studer, A.; Perrig, A.","KDDI R&D Labs.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.",,978-0-7695-2847-2,,10.1109/AINAW.2007.212,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118,,Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server,Internet;cryptography,HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems,,5,1,23,,,21-23 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

SA algorithm find the optimal point by a form of probability, and it is proved that if enough time is given, the SA can certainly find the optimal point.

How to detect cloned tags in a reliable way from incomplete RFID traces,"Lehtonen, M.; Michahelles, F.; Fleisch, E.","Inf. Manage., ETH Zurich, Zurich","RFID, 2009 IEEE International Conference on",20090508,2009,,,257,264,"Cloning of RFID tags may lead to considerable financial losses and worse reputation in many commercial applications, while being attractive for adversaries. One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.",,978-1-4244-3337-7,978-1-4244-3338-4,10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190,,Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management,probability;radiofrequency identification,RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain,,7,5,23,,,27-28 April 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Most of the systems that perform deep packet inspection implement basic string matching algorithms to match packets against large but finite strings. However, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power.

Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm is a multiple patterns matching algorithm commonly used for such applications. In order to meet the highly demanding performance requirements imposed on these applications, achieving high performance for AC algorithm is crucial. In this paper, we present a high performance parallel implementation of AC algorithm on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) which efficiently utilizes the high degree of on-chip parallelism and the memory hierarchy of the GPU so that the aggregate performance (or throughput) of the GPU can be maximized. For this purpose our approach carefully places and caches the input text data and the reference pattern data used for pattern matching in the on-chip shared memories and the texture caches of the GPU. Furthermore, it efficiently schedules the off-chip global memory loads and the shared memory stores in order to minimize the overheads in loading the input data to the shared memories and also to minimize the shared memory bank conflicts. The proposed approach leads to a significant cut-down of the effective memory access latencies and leads to impressive performance improvements.

To overcome these limitations, we apply modular neural network models to detect and recognize attacks in computer networks. They are based on the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) neural networks and multilayer perceptrons (MLP). PCA networks are employed for important data extraction and to reduce high dimensional data vectors. We present two PCA neural networks for feature extraction: linear PCA (LPCA) and nonlinear PCA (NPCA). MLP is employed to detect and recognize attacks using feature-extracted data instead of original data. The proposed approaches are tested with the help of KDD-99 dataset.

Classification of Disturbances and Cyber-Attacks in Power Systems Using Heterogeneous Time-Synchronized Data,"Shengyi Pan; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.","Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS, USA","Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on",20150602,2015,11,3,650,662,"Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.",1094-6977,,,10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103,Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests,Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data,computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data,IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches,,14,,39,,,Sept. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

The created models are stored in Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) notation that describe packet level details, such as protocol header information, and in Message Sequence Chart (MSC) notation which is used for describing scenario information of network activities, for example describing a port scan with vulnerability exploitation attempt. The proposed tool will utilize Snort rules in the model creation process where a Snort rule is transformed into XML and MSC models. Besides Snort rules, the proposed tool is able to utilize network traffic traces stored in a packet capture format (Pcap). These traces may contain diverse set of different network activities that are relevant in gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. Using these traces the proposed tool can create XML and MSC models that depict the malicious activities. The experimental utilization of the proposed tool will indicate that the XML and MSC models can be created fast and automatically using two separate sources and this will reduce the amount manual work required in the modelling process.",,978-1-4577-1717-8,,10.1109/ComComAp.2012.6154805,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6154805,MSC;Modelling;Pcap;Snort rule;XML;network intrusion detection,Analytical models;Generators;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Unified modeling language;XML,XML;computer network security;telecommunication traffic,MSC model;Snort rules;XML notation;computer network;computer system;extensible mark-up language notation;message sequence chart notation;network activity;network intrusion detection model;network traffic trace;packet capture format;protocol header information;unauthorized access;vulnerability exploitation attempt,,0,,24,,,11-13 Jan. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Routing through an integrated communication and social network,"Bigrigg, M.W.; Carley, K.M.; Manousakis, K.; McAuley, A.","Inst. for Software Res., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Military Communications Conference, 2009. MILCOM 2009. IEEE",20100115,2009,,,1,7,"This paper explores the robust routing of messages among individuals. Traditional routing assumes individuals provide messages to a device connected to a communications network that assumes all responsibility for message delivery. Although each individual may have links to multiple communication devices (office computer, PDA, cell phone), messages are delivered only if there is an end-to-end communication path between communication devices available to each individual. To improve robustness of communication, especially in dynamic ad hoc military networks, this paper models a novel routing paradigm using an integrated communication and social network. The understanding is that individuals can and do route messages through a social network in conjunction with the communication network. An example of this is an individual asking another in his immediate social network to place a call on his behalf when the official communication system is not convenient or is unavailable. We show that it is possible to route messages through the integrated social and communication network by: a) using the ORA social analysis tool to select normalized costs for the social and communication network links (e.g., to reflect the link delay, quality or robustness), and b) using the MONOPATI communication design tool to model the integrated socio-communication network as a graph and performing QoS routing.

A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

Traditionally, the signature matching engine compares the signature with a single audit data stream to identify occurrences of the action sequence described in the signature. Such approach introduces a single point of failure and uses huge bandwidth for transferring audit data from the data sources to the matching engine. Our approach decomposes an extended infinite state machine, an operational representation of an attack signature, into multiple cooperative finite state machines that enable distributed signature engines to match the signature. We describe the decomposition methodology and the distributed matching algorithm and illustrate them using several example multi-stage attacks in tactical networks.

Due to its large memory footprint, a large-dictionary AC-DFA can experience poor cache performance when matching against inputs with high match ratio on multicore processors. We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint. The B-NFA extends the matching to full dictionary lengths in a compact variable-stride branch data structure, accelerated by single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. A branch grafting mechanism is proposed to opportunistically advance the state of the H-DFA with the matching progress in the B-NFA.

Most previous work studies these two classes of issues separately. In this paper, we propose a framework of combining intrusion detection and continuous authentication in MANETs. In this framework, multimodal biometrics are used for continuous authentication, and intrusion detection is modeled as sensors to detect system security state.

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages.

For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory.

Electric power dispatch systems, management information systems, customer relation systems and so on, are all built on this infrastructure. It is an important task for network administrators of electric power industry to monitor, control and manage electric power information networks. Through installing safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-virus systems, the reliability of Electric Power Information Networks has been improved to a certain extent. However, threats also exist due to the loss of comprehensive understanding about network vulnerability. System methods should be employed to the vulnerability research of electric power information networks. Modeling Electric Power Information Network vulnerability and finding network flaws become more and more critical. A network intruder will take a series of actions to achieve a certain goal, and each action will change the state of a network. Thereby attack trees can be used to model the vulnerability of a network. An attack tree can be viewed as a directed tree where vertices represent network states and edges represent actions that lead state transitions. Root vertex is a certain goal. Any path from a leaf vertex to the root vertex is a whole attack pattern violating the security property of a network. A node of an attack tree can be decomposed as a set of attack sub-goals, either all of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed, or any one of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed. So there are two decomposition operations in an attack tree: AND and OR. Formal logic can be applied to attack analysis. Thus we can model attacks for network vulnerability analysis. This modeling method has two major advantages. At first it can be used to analyze the flaws of a network - - and find unknown flaws. Secondly network administrators use it to handle flaws rationally under the limits of the finite resources. Electric power information networks are generally made up of production control networks, enterprise management networks and external networks. They are connected and form a complex network. It is necessary to comprehend and analyze its vulnerability. An information network of an electric power plant is illustrated, and attack modeling is used to analyze its vulnerability. Industry control computers can manipulate electric devices. It is vital to guarantee industry control computers. Hence the goal is set to obtain the administrator right of an industry control computer. An attack tree is constructed tolocate the flaws of the network. Some advices to network security administrators are given. It is an attempt to formulate the security administration of electric power information networks using attack trees.

SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity.

The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module.

Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases. Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC. A pattern with distinct 16-byte prefix only occupies up to three lookup table entries in QSV. The overall memory cost of our system is about 1.4 Mbyte, i.e., 1.4 bit per character of the ClamAV pattern set.

In this paper, by exploiting the location history traversed by a mobile user, two domain-independent online anomaly detection schemes are designed, namely the Lempel-Ziv (LZ)-based and Markov-based detection schemes. The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Third International Conference on",20050801,2005,2,,214,219,This paper presents a model for real-time network monitoring and anomaly detection that provides a holistic view of network conversation exchanges. We argue that monitoring and anomaly detection are necessary mechanisms for ensuring secure and dependable network computing infrastructure. The model for network traffic exchange is based on a modified Ehrenfest urn model and combines statistical physics and queuing theory to provide macrostate descriptions of complex networked systems when the exact microstate parameters of each element in the system precludes global understanding from first principles. The conversation exchange dynamics model for real-time network monitoring and anomaly detection is formally presented in this context as a system-driven data reduction model. The model induces a unique real-time visualization capability for network monitoring and detection of anomalous events.

Real-Time Intrusion Detection and Tracking in Indoor Environment through Distributed RSSI Processing,"Kaltiokallio, O.; Bocca, M.","Sch. of Electr. Eng., Dept. of Autom. &amp; Syst. Technol., Aalto Univ., Helsinki, Finland","Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA), 2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on",20110929,2011,1,,61,70,"In the context of wireless sensor networks, the received signal strength indicator has been traditionally exploited for localization, distance estimation, and link quality assessment. Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.",1533-2306,978-1-4577-1118-3,,10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830,RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks,,14,,28,,,28-31 Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Recent studies show that current computer architecture advances and CPU performance improvements have limited impact on network protocol processing performance. Some studies find that in real SMT processor like Intel Xeon processor with hyper-threadings, the sharing resources (like cache) contention between threads can hurt the processing performance of network applications like servers or IDS. How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads. We find (1) the load/store units can be the bottleneck of protocol processing; and (2) in connection establishing phase of TCP processing, cache contention between threads is more aggressive than any other phase.

Four models are proposed to clarify the security problems: software vulnerability model, scalability model, authentication model, and covert model. We also propose several defense principles for all models. The security reduction is also proposed to transform the solution method for security problems to other available security verification and testing approaches.

However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator.

Proceedings. 19th IEEE International",20050418,2005,,,41a,41a,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensors' locations play a critical role in many applications. Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies.

The fingerprint scrubber restricts an attacker's ability to determine the operating system of a protected host. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks-attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection-on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

A Memory-Efficient and Modular Approach for Large-Scale String Pattern Matching,"Hoang Le; Prasanna, V.K.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Computers, IEEE Transactions on",20130328,2013,62,5,844,857,"In Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs), string pattern matching demands exceptionally high performance to match the content of network traffic against a predefined database (or dictionary) of malicious patterns. Much work has been done in this field; however, most of the prior work results in low memory efficiency (defined as the ratio of the amount of the required storage in bytes and the size of the dictionary in number of characters). Due to such inefficiency, state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose an algorithm called leaf-attaching to preprocess a given dictionary without increasing the number of patterns. The resulting set of postprocessed patterns can be searched using any tree-search data structure. We also present a scalable, high-throughput, Memory-efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM) based on a pipelined binary search tree. The proposed algorithm and architecture achieve a memory efficiency of 0.56 (for the Rogets dictionary) and 1.32 (for the Snort dictionary). As a result, our design scales well to support larger dictionaries. Implementations on 45 nm ASIC and a state-of-the-art FPGA device (for latest Rogets and Snort dictionaries) show that our architecture achieves 24 and 3.2 Gbps, respectively. The MASM module can simply be duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle.

Unlike the present approaches which assess the attack threat either from a backward perspective (how probable a security state can be reached) or from the perspective of the attacks themselves (how much an attack would cause damage to the network), this approach assesses the attack threat from a forwarding perspective (how probable it would be the precursor of future attacks). First, to every attack type and some attack scenarios, their probabilities of having following attacks(PFAs) are calculated by a data mining algorithm. Then the threats of real time intrusions are assessed by these probabilities. The result of the threat assessment can help identify the intrusion alerts which would be the best evidence for the coming attacks from tremendous amount of intrusion alerts, thus this approach can be used for intrusion prediction.

An improved Hidden Markov Model for anomaly detection using frequent common patterns,"Sultana, A.; Hamou-Lhadj, A.; Couture, M.",,"Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on",20121129,2012,,,1113,1117,"Host-based intrusion detection techniques are needed to ensure the safety and security of software systems, especially, if these systems handle sensitive data. Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own.

Detection and repair of software errors in hierarchical sensor networks,"Herbert, D.; Yung-Hsiang Lu; Bagchi, S.; Zhiyuan Li","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN","Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing, 2006. IEEE International Conference on",20060619,2006,1,,8 pp.,,"Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for collecting critical data in various applications. Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (invariants). These invariants are associated with conditions (the observed variables) of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits.

PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters,"Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on",20090127,2008,,,73,80,"PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.",,978-1-4244-3783-2,978-1-4244-2796-3,10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368,,Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic,computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases,Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler,,2,,22,,,8-10 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In order to reduce the number of state transitions, the finite state machine tiles in a string matcher adopt bit-level input symbols. Long target patterns are divided into subpatterns with a fixed length; deterministic finite automata are built with the subpatterns.

In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.

By adding edge , the local automata are combined into global automata to describe and detect software behaviour. However, these methods introduce nondeterminacy, leading to models that are imprecise or inefficient. We present a model of software Behaviour Detection based on Process Algebra and system call (BDPA). In this model, a system call is mapped into an action, and a function is mapped into a process. We construct a process expression for each function to describe its behaviour. Without constructing automata or introducing nondeterminacy, we use algebraic properties and algorithms to obtain a global process expression by combining the process expressions derived from each function. Behaviour detection rules and methods based on BDPA are determined by equivalence theory. Experiments demonstrate that the BDPA model has better precision and efficiency than traditional methods.",1673-5447,,,10.1109/CC.2013.6674207,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6674207,intrusion detection;process algebra;software behaviour model;static analysis;system call,Analytical models;Automata;Behavioral science;Binary codes;Computational modeling;Mathematical model,automata theory;process algebra;software engineering,BDPA;global automata;local automata;process algebra;software behaviour detection;system call,,0,,,,,Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Each regular expression (regex) is first parsed into a concise token list representation, then compiled to a modular nondeterministic finite automaton (RE-NFA) using a modified version of the McNaughton-Yamada algorithm. The RE-NFA can be mapped directly onto a compact register-transistor level (RTL) circuit. A number of optimizations are applied to improve the circuit performance: 1) spatial stacking is used to construct an REM circuit processing m  1 input characters per clock cycle; 2) single-character constrained repetitions are matched efficiently by parallel shift-register lookup tables; 3) complex character classes are matched by a BRAM-based classifier shared across regexes; 4) a multipipeline architecture is used to organize a large number of RE-NFAs into priority groups to limit the I/O size of the circuit.

We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks.

Classification of SIP messages by a syntax filter and SVMs,"Ferdous, R.; Lo Cigno, R.; Zorat, A.","Univ. of Trento, Trento, Italy","Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2012 IEEE",20130422,2012,,,2714,2719,"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is at the root of many sessions-based applications such as VoIP and media streaming that are used by a growing number of users and organizations. The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as good or bad depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM learns the structure of the good and bad SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also real SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution.

However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen.

However, traditional Finite Automata cannot keep up with the ever-growing speed of the Internet links. Although there are a number of efficient FA compressing mechanisms for DPIs, there is no standardized or common way to evaluate and compare them. In this scenario, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate and compare automaton models and the data-structures that materialize them. We also adapt state-of-the-art memory layouts to better fit in today's computer architectures.

This paper focuses on issues related to the security of the smart grid and the smart home, which we present as an integral part of the smart grid. Based on several scenarios, we aim to present some of the most representative threats to the smart home/smart grid environment. The threats detected are categorized according to specific security goals set for the smart home/smart grid environment, and their impact on the overall system security is evaluated.

A Dynamic Anomaly Detection Scheme for AODV-Based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Nakayama, H.; Kurosawa, S.; Jamalipour, A.; Nemoto, Y.; Kato, N.","Grad. Sch. of Inf. Sci., Tohoku Univ., Sendai","Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on",20090508,2009,58,5,2471,2481,"Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are usually formed without any major infrastructure. As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks.

To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors.

With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks).

Bypassing Space Explosion in High-Speed Regular Expression Matching,"Patel, J.; Liu, A.X.; Torng, E.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20141218,2014,22,6,1701,1714,"Network intrusion detection and prevention systems commonly use regular expression (RE) signatures to represent individual security threats. While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a Union then Minimize framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a Minimize then Union framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms.

Since profiling complex sequential data is still an open problem in anomaly detection, there is a need to explore new approaches.

In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM).

The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used.

String matching circuits have been studied extensively for intrusion detection systems. An NFA-based string matching circuit, one of the works, has expandability of the processing data width. Due to the huge hardware requirement, it was difficult to implement an NFA-based string matching circuit with the whole Snort 2.3.3 rule (35461 characters) that processes at 10 Gbps on a single FPGA. To reduce the circuit area, we eliminate redundant states of the NFA with the Aho-Corasick approach and redundant AND-gates in the NFA. Consequently, our method reduces the resource requirements by over 50% as compared with previous NFA-based circuits, and the synthesis result shows that a matching circuit that includes the whole Snort 2.3.3 rule can be implemented onto a single Xilinx Virtex-II pro xc2vp-100 with throughput over 10 Gbps",,1-4244-0312-X,,10.1109/FPL.2006.311317,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101079,,Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Data processing;Electronics industry;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Industrial electronics;Intrusion detection;Network synthesis;Throughput,field programmable gate arrays;logic design;security of data,10 Gbit/s;Aho-Corasick approach;FPGA;Snort 2.3.3 rule;Xilinx Virtex-II pro xc2vp-100;field programmable gate arrays;intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automation;redundant AND-gates;scalable NFA-based string matching circuit,,0,1,8,,,28-30 Aug. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

We have been exploring deliberate deception in defensive tactics by information systems under cyber-attack as during information warfare. We have developed a tool to systematically counterplan or find ways to foil a particular attack plan. Our approach is to first find all possible atomic ploys that can interfere with the plan. Ploys are simple deceits the operating system can do such as lying about the status of a file. We analyze ploys as to the degree of difficulty they cause to the plan wherever they can be applied. We then formulate a counterplan by selecting the most cost-effective set of ploys and assign appropriate presentation methods for them, taking into account the likelihood that, if we are not careful, the attacker will realize they are being deceived and will terminate our game with them. The counterplan can be effected by a modified operating system.

Accelerating Multi-Patterns Matching on Compressed HTTP Traffic,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Koral, Y.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya","INFOCOM 2009, IEEE",20090602,2009,,,397,405,"One of the fundamental technique which is used today by network security tools to detect malicious activities is 'signature based' detection. Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic.

On the Effectiveness of Monitoring for Intrusion Detection in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Boppana, R.V.; Xu Su","Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.210,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919,Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.,Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement,Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration,,3,,32,,11/9/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

After formulating the cooperation between basic detectors as a partially observable Markov decision process, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to search in an optimal cooperation manner, with the objective to achieve broader detection coverage and fewer false alerts.

Present day vulnerability scanners are able to identify the vulnerabilities in isolation but there is a need for correlation among these vulnerabilities to identify overall risk of the network.

A quantitative approach towards detection of an optimal attack path in a wireless network using modified PSO technique,"Ghosh, N.; Nanda, S.; Ghosh, S.K.","Sch. of Inf.

First International",20090331,2009,,,1,10,"In recent years there has been an immense proliferation of wireless networks and they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Thus there is a serious need to secure such networks from attacks. Usually an attacker can penetrate into a network by utilizing a chain of exploits. An exploit is a small piece of code that makes use of vulnerabilities present in a service or in a system. Each exploit in the chain has a set of preconditions and effects and lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploits. Application of such a chain of exploits generates a set of attack states or network states which form a path called the attack path and combining many such attack paths produces an attack graph. A lot of research has been done on issues such as scalable and time efficient ways of generation of attack graphs in wired network in contrast to that in wireless scenario. Moreover, the need is to identify the path that may be chosen by the attacker to comprise a target system in less time and effort. The proposed methodology in this paper aims as finding out the optimal or risk-prone attack path that the attacker may choose to penetrate a wireless network. The generation of attack paths in a wireless network is itself a difficult proposition due to networks inherent dynamic nature and ever changing topology. In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been employed for finding out the optimal attack path using an attack vector metric. The effort required on the part of the attacker to compromise a target system has been termed as an attack vector. The wireless nodes have been assigned severity measures obtained from customized risk parameters which serve as an input to the modified PSO technique. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.",,978-1-4244-2912-7,978-1-4244-2913-4,10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808869,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808869,,Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;IP networks;Information technology;National security;Network topology;Particle swarm optimization;Wide area networks;Wireless networks,particle swarm optimisation;radio networks;telecommunication security,attack graph;attack vector metric;chain-of-exploits;modified PSO;network security;optimal attack path;particle swarm optimization;wireless network,,1,,35,,,5-10 Jan. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Second International Symposium on",20091023,2009,2,,34,38,"High-speed packet content inspection and filtering devices rely on a fast multi-pattern matching algorithm which is used to detect predefined keywords or signatures in the packets. In TCP, a communication data stream is split into packets. Therefore, a target pattern may span multiple packets. Such fragmented pattern cannot be discovered by a per-packet scan. This is a serious problem in applications such as NIDS that require a complete scan. To avoid the problem, it is necessary to scan TCP streams. Stream-level parallelism is not a substantial solution because bandwidth depends on the number of active TCP streams. To scan each stream separately using one matching unit, the match states must be swapped appropriately. Another problem is, as parts of network infrastructure, the inspection units should support the function of QoS. In this paper, we proposed a multi-pattern matching automaton DSC-AC for high speed multi-stream packet scanning. We given out the construction of DSC-AC and optimized it with optimal and two binary searching tree and bit-map AC.

Reorganized and Compact DFA for Efficient Regular Expression Matching,Kai Wang; Yaxuan Qi; Yibo Xue; Jun Li,,"Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on",20110728,2011,,,1,5,"Regular expression matching has become a critical yet challenging technique in content-aware network processing, such as application identification and deep inspection. To meet the requirement for processing heavy network traffic at line rate, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is widely used to accelerate regular expression matching at the expense of large memory usage. In this paper, we propose a DFA-based algorithm named RCDFA (Reorganized and Compact DFA), which dramatically reduces the memory usage while maintaining fast and deterministic lookup speed. Based on the dissection of real-life DFA tables, we observe that almost every state has multiple similar states, i.e. they share identical next-state transitions for most input characters. However, these similar states often distribute at nonadjacent positions in the original DFA table. RCDFA aims at reorganizing all similar states into adjacent entries, so that identical transitions become consecutive along the state dimension, then compresses the reorganized DFA table utilizing bitmap technique. Coupled with mapping along the character dimension, RCDFA is not only efficient in DFA compression, but also effective for hardware implementation. Experiment results show, RCDFA has superior performance in terms of high processing speed, low memory usage and short preprocessing time. RCDFA consistently achieves over 95% compression ratio for existing real-life rule sets.

We have developed a tool to systematically counterplan or find ways to foil a particular attack plan. Our approach is to first find all possible atomic ploys that can interfere with the plan. Ploys are simple deceits the operating system can do such as lying about the status of a file. We analyze ploys as to the degree of difficulty they cause to the plan wherever they can be applied. We then formulate a counterplan by selecting the most cost-effective set of ploys and assign appropriate presentation methods for them, taking into account the likelihood that, if we are not careful, the attacker will realize they are being deceived and terminate our game with them. The counterplan can be effected by a modified operating system.

However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy.

This paper focuses on compressed HTTP traffic. HTTP uses GZIP compression and requires some kind of decompression phase before performing a string matching. We present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP (ACCH), that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern-matching algorithm.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender.

Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail.

Masquerade attacks are serious in nature due to the fact that they are mostly carried by insiders and thus are extremely difficult to detect. Detection of these attacks is done by monitoring significant changes in user's behavior based on his/her profile. Currently, such profiles are based mostly on the user command line data and do not represent his/her complete behavior in a graphical user interface (GUI) based system and hence are not sufficient to quickly detect such masquerade attacks. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating a unique feature set for user behavior on GUI based systems.

These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a user session. We model our technique of user identification and masquerade detection as a binary classification problem and use support vector machine (SVM) to learn and classify these feature vectors. We show that our technique can provide detection rates of up to 96% with few false positives based on these feature vectors.

A system that can adapt its security mechanisms to the actual threat level can deliver better performance. In this paper, we provide an architecture for self-adapting the security concern to the actual context. Context is provided in terms of trust and threat values.

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.).

Artificial immune systems, which is a sub field of artificial intelligence, comprises systems modeled by simplifying models from the biological immune system. If agent-based modeling and simulation is used as a laboratory for understanding the biological immune system then, it can also be used for transferring the observed principles into artificial immune system models or for evaluating models that have been already adapted for solving technical problems. This paper presents first, a methodology for transferring principles of the biological immune system into the field of artificial immune systems. Then, it presents a brief explanation of the behavior of the cells of the biological immune system, which are treated as internal agents inside a biological organism.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid access control framework, named iHAC, which combines the advantages of both Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Type Enforcement (TE) model to enable unified access control and authorization for IaaS clouds. A permission transition model is provided to dynamically assign permission to virtual machines.

CompactDFA: Generic State Machine Compression for Scalable Pattern Matching,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160,,Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils,data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data,Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms,,14,1,21,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed.

A comparison of techniques for on-line incremental learning of HMM parameters in anomaly detection,"Khreich, W.; Granger, E.; Miri, A.; Sabourin, R.","Lab. d''Imagerie, de Vision et d''Intell. Artificielle (LIVIA), Ecole de Technol. Super., Montreal, QC, Canada","Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications, 2009. CISDA 2009. IEEE Symposium on",20091218,2009,,,1,8,"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in intrusion detection systems. Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.",,978-1-4244-3763-4,978-1-4244-3764-1,10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542,,Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data,hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity,,0,,20,,,8-10 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
A workload for evaluating deep packet inspection architectures,"Becchi, M.; Franklin, M.; Crowley, P.","Comput. Sci. & Eng. Dept., Washington Univ. in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO","Workload Characterization, 2008. IISWC 2008. IEEE International Symposium on",20080930,2008,,,79,89,"High-speed content inspection of network traffic is an important new application area for programmable networking systems, and has recently led to several proposals for high-performance regular expression matching. At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).",,978-1-4244-2777-2,978-1-4244-2778-9,10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093,,Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system,,20,1,28,,,14-16 Sept. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Fast and Scalable Pattern Matching for Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Sarang Dharmapurikar; Lockwood, J.W.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20061002,2006,24,10,1781,1792,"High-speed packet content inspection and filtering devices rely on a fast multipattern matching algorithm which is used to detect predefined keywords or signatures in the packets. Multipattern matching is known to require intensive memory accesses and is often a performance bottleneck. Hence, specialized hardware-accelerated algorithms are required for line-speed packet processing. We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory. Furthermore, we modify this algorithm to be able to handle arbitrarily large strings at the cost of a little more on-chip memory. We demonstrate the merit of our algorithm through theoretical analysis and simulations performed on Snort's string set",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2006.877131,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705611,,Costs;Data structures;Field programmable gate arrays;Filtering algorithms;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Very large scale integration,VLSI;cryptography;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;filtering theory;network-on-chip;packet switching;string matching;telecommunication security,Bloom filter;Snort's string set;embedded on-chip memory block;field programmable gate array;filtering device;hardware-accelerated algorithm;high-speed packet content inspection;line-speed packet processing;memory access;multihashing data structure;multipattern matching algorithm;network intrusion detection system;string matching;very large scale integration chip,,53,11,16,,,Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine
Fuzzy Online Risk Assessment for Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems,"Haslum, K.; Abraham, A.; Knapskog, Svein",,"Computer Modeling and Simulation, 2008. UKSIM 2008. Tenth International Conference on",20080415,2008,,,216,223,"A Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems (DIPPS) not only detects and prevents possible intrusions but also possesses the capability to predict possible intrusions in a distributed network. Based on the DIPS sensors, instead of merely preventing the attackers or blocking traffic, we propose a fuzzy logic based online risk assessment scheme. The key idea of DIPPS is to protect the network(s) linked to assets, which are considered to be very risky. To implement DIPPS we used a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) with extended real time traffic surveillance and online risk assessment. To model and predict the next step of an attacker, we used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the interaction between the attacker and the network. The interaction between various DIDS and integration of their output are achieved through a HMM. The novelty of this paper is the detailed development of Fuzzy Logic Controllers to estimate the various risk(s) that are dependent on several other variables based on the inputs from HMM modules and the DIDS agents. To develop the fuzzy risk expert system, if-then fuzzy rules were formulated based on interviews with security experts and network administrators. Preliminary results indicate that such a system is very practical for protecting assets which are prone to attacks or misuse, i.e. highly at risk.",,0-7695-3114-8,,10.1109/UKSIM.2008.30,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488934,distributed monitoring;fuzzy logic;internet security;intrusion prevention,Electronics packaging;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Hybrid intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Real time systems;Risk management;Telecommunication traffic,,,,5,,6,,,1-3 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
