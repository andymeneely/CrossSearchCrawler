Open-Flow as a major API for SDN applies <;match, action> rules to every packet. However, it only supports a few actions that are all predefined. We extend this limitation of OpenFlow and propose User-Defined Actions (UDAs) for SDN. We discuss usecases of UDAs and propose an architecture to realize UDAs. Using our architecture we conduct a series of tests. We indicate that our UDAs can elevate millisecond-scale running time of current proposals to nanosecond-scale (including proposals from northbound applications of SDN community and virtual appliances of Network Function Virtualization or NFV community). Also, regarding ease of programmability, we show that our proposal decrease the lines of code of by 72.9% and 79.3% compared to implementing the same functionality as a northbound application and as a standalone middlebox, respectively.

Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20140227,2014,63,1,270,289,"This paper presents a new method, capable of automatically generating attacks on binary programs from software crashes. We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt.

The Eighth International Conference on",20080819,2008,,,77,86,"SQL injection is one of the most prominent vulnerabilities for web-based applications. Exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities (SQLIV) through successful attacks might result in severe consequences such as authentication bypassing, leaking of private information etc. Therefore, testing an application for SQLIV is an important step for ensuring its quality. However, it is challenging as the sources of SQLIV vary widely, which include the lack of effective input filters in applications, insecure coding by programmers, inappropriate usage of APIs for manipulating databases etc. Moreover, existing testing approaches do not address the issue of generating adequate test data sets that can detect SQLIV. In this work, we present a mutation-based testing approach for SQLIV testing. We propose nine mutation operators that inject SQLIV in application source code. The operators result in mutants, which can be killed only with test data containing SQL injection attacks. By this approach, we force the generation of an adequate test data set containing effective test cases capable of revealing SQLIV. We implement a MUtation-based SQL Injection vulnerabilities Checking (testing) tool (MUSIC) that automatically generates mutants for the applications written in Java Server Pages (JSP) and performs mutation analysis. We validate the proposed operators with five open source web-based applications written in JSP.

In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes.

MobiQuitous 2007. Fourth Annual International Conference on",20080212,2007,,,1,8,"The exponential growth in wireless network faults, vulnerabilities, and attacks make the wireless local area network (WLAN) security management a challenging research area. Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks.

Since Joshua Wright's KillerBee Framework was released with its focus on exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee networks, non security-hardened WSNs increase the risk of being vulnerable against certain attacks such as simple association flooding and packet replay attacks.

Such applications can implement logic to provide complex quarantine procedures, or redirect malicious network flows for their special treatment. Security detection and intrusion prevention algorithms can be implemented as OpenFlow security applications, however, their implementation is often more concise and effective.

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks.

The rule-based component consists of a set of well-defined rules which give independent evidences about a transaction's behavior. An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed. First level inferences are made about the transaction depending on this initial belief. Once the transaction is found to be suspicious, belief is updated according to its similarity with malicious or genuine transaction history using Bayesian learning.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible.

Self-configuration enables the system to automatically configure security system and change the configuration of its resources and their operational policies at runtime in order to manage the system security. Our self-configuration approach is implemented using two software modules: component management interface (CMI) to specify the configuration and operational policies associated with each component that can be a hardware resource or a software component; and component runtime manager (CRM) that manages the component operations using the policies defined in CMI.

IEEE",20030415,2002,6,,Jun-85,6-2695 vol.6,"While attacks against an enterprise's Internet connection receive the most attention, attacks against an enterprise through the voice network remain common. Attackers can bypass Internet-related defenses through access to unauthorized and poorly secured modems. The Internet itself, and an enterprise's Internet security policies and procedures, has made this issue worse by forcing addicted users to access the Internet through their Internet Service Provider (ISP). A typical enterprise, even one with modem usage policies and procedures, will have some number of unauthorized and/or poorly secured modems. Traditional techniques do not address this issue. Scanning and modem protection technologies assist in enforcement, but do not solve the problem. The ideal solution lies in applying concepts from the IP security network to the voice network. By deploying in-line security devices on all voice network trunk circuits, applications such as firewalls, integrated scanning, authentication, virtual private networks (VPNs), and intrusion detection can be applied. This approach provides the same level of protection and a familiar paradigm on the voice network, as is present on the IP network.

Creating Vulnerability Signatures Using Weakest Preconditions,"Brumley, D.; Hao Wang; Jha, S.; Song, D.",,"Computer Security Foundations Symposium, 2007. CSF '07. 20th IEEE",20070716,2007,,,311,325,"Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.",1940-1434,0-7695-2819-8,,10.1109/CSF.2007.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657,,Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic,safety systems;security of data;software reliability,automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions,,9,2,50,,,6-8 July 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

We then add one additional dimension to the problem domain by also taking into consideration the overlap relationship between patterns. We argue that an execution path of an application is usually not an arbitrary combination of various patterns; but rather, they overlap each other in some specific order. Such overlap relationship characterizes the normal behavior of the application. Finally, a novel pattern matching module is proposed to detect intrusions based on both intra-pattern and inter-pattern anomalies.

Network topology authentication, and hybrid key cryptography are the building blocks for this proposal: the former means that a cryptographic key can be generated if and only if the current network topology is compliant to the ldquoplanned network topologyrdquo, which acts as the authenticated reference; the latter means that the proposed scheme is a combination of features from symmetric (for the ciphering and authentication model) and asymmetric cryptography (for the key generation model). The proposal fits the security requirement of a cryptographic scheme for WSN in a limited computing resource. A deep quantitative security analysis has been carried out.

The privacy of users is of paramount importance to administrators and organizations, which are reluctant to cooperate between each other and exchange network traffic traces. The main reasons behind reluctance to exchange monitored data are the protection of the users' privacy and the fear of information leakage about the internal infrastructure. Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic.

However, security modules in conventional kernel-level reference monitors are usually not portable to other kernels and require detailed knowledge about kernel internals. Furthermore, different security modules are often not composable and conflict with each other. This paper describes a reference monitor called SysGuard that addresses these problems. SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls.

Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace.

We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier.

IEEE Symposium on",20080528,2008,,,296,310,"Rootkits are used by malicious attackers who desire to run software on a compromised machine without being detected. They have become stealthier over the years as a consequence of the ongoing struggle between attackers and system defenders. In order to explore the next step in rootkit evolution and to build strong defenses, we look at this issue from the point of view of an attacker. We construct Cloaker, a proof-of-concept rootkit for the ARM platform that is non- persistent and only relies on hardware state modifications for concealment and operation. A primary goal in the design of Cloaker is to not alter any part of the host operating system (OS) code or data, thereby achieving immunity to all existing rootkit detection techniques which perform integrity, behavior and signature checks of the host OS.

Packets everywhere: The great opportunity for field programmable technology,"Brebner, G.","Xilinx Res. Labs., San Jose, CA, USA","Field-Programmable Technology, 2009. FPT 2009. International Conference on",20100112,2009,,,1,10,"The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification.

RAD: a compile-time solution to buffer overflow attacks,Tzi-cker Chiueh; Fu-Hau Hsu,"Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents a compiler-based solution to the notorious buffer overflow attack problem. Using this solution, users can prevent attackers from compromising their systems by changing the return address to execute injected code, which is the most common method used in buffer overflow attacks. Return address defender (RAD) is a simple compiler patch that automatically creates a safe area to store a copy of return addresses and automatically adds protection code into applications that it compiles to defend programs against buffer overflow attacks. Using it to protect a program does not need to modify the source code of the protected programs. Moreover, RAD does not change the layout of stack frames, so binary code it generated is compatible with existing libraries and other object files. Empirical performance measurements on a fully operational RAD prototype show that programs protected by RAD only experience a factor of between 1.01 to 1.31 slow-down.

Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup.

Toward Realistic and Artifact-Free Insider-Threat Data,"Killourhy, K.S.; Maxion, R.A.","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2007. ACSAC 2007.

For reasons of privacy and confidentiality, no one wants to expose their sensitive data to the research community. Data can be sanitized to mitigate privacy and confidentiality concerns, but the mere act of sanitizing the data may introduce artifacts that compromise its utility for research purposes. If sanitization artifacts change the results of insider-threat experiments, then those results could lead to conclusions which are not true in the real world. The goal of this work is to investigate the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat detection experiments. We assemble a suite of tools and present a methodology for collecting and sanitizing data. We use these tools and methods in an experimental evaluation of an insider-threat detection system. We compare the results of the evaluation using raw data to the results using each of three types of sanitized data, and we measure the effect of each sanitization strategy. We establish that two of the three sanitization strategies actually alter the results of the experiment. Since these two sanitization strategies are commonly used in practice, we must be concerned about the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat research.

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards.

This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations.

This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer).

Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection,Jiang Ming; Haibin Zhang; Debin Gao,"Coll. of Inf. Sci. & Technol., Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","Network and System Security (NSS), 2011 5th International Conference on",20111027,2011,,,25,32,"Anomaly detection has been attracting interests from researchers due to its advantage of being able to detect zero-day exploits. A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable.

At the same time, Web applications tend to be error prone and implementation vulnerabilities are readily and commonly exploited by attackers. The design of countermeasures that detect or prevent such vulnerabilities or protect against their exploitation is an important research challenge for the fields of software engineering and security engineering. In this paper, we focus on one specific type of implementation vulnerability, namely, broken dependencies on session data. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications. The proposed solution combines development-time program annotation, static verification, and runtime checking to provably protect against broken data dependencies. We have developed a prototype implementation of our approach, building on the JML annotation language and the existing static verification tool ESC/Java2, and we successfully applied our approach to a representative J2EE-based e-commerce application.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level.

Classification of computer attacks using a self-organizing map,"DeLooze, L.L.",,"Information Assurance Workshop, 2004. Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC",20050606,2004,,,365,369,"As computer technology evolves and the threat of computer crimes increases, the apprehension and preemption of such violations become more and more difficult and challenging. To date, it appears that completely preventing breaches of security is unrealistic. Therefore, we must try to detect and classify these intrusions as they occur so that immediate actions may be taken to repair the damage and prevent further harm. One attempt at classifying these intrusions is MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list that provides a common name for all publicly known security weaknesses. The CVE dictionary, however, is not taxonomy. The CVE list is organized in simple numerical order by date of acceptance. Each entry in the dictionary includes a unique CVE identification number, a text description of the vulnerability and any pertinent references. Creating a self-organizing map (SOM) using the text description allows us to order attack profiles with common features in the same general area of the output space. Attacks in the general neighborhood of one another should be able to be mitigated by similar means. Plotting attacks on a SOM also enables us to visually examine the placement of an attack relative to the four common classes of attacks (Denial of Service, Deception, Reconnaissance, and Unauthorized Access). Many attacks have features in common with more than one of these classes rather than corresponding directly to a single class. We have developed an effective technique to classify new attacks using a unique taxonomy, which breaks down threats into the four general categories, and the SOM created by the baseline CVE descriptions.",,0-7803-8572-1,,10.1109/IAW.2004.1437840,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437840,,Computer crime;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Dictionaries;Organizing;Reconnaissance;Software standards;Taxonomy;Web pages,authorisation;computer crime;self-organising feature maps,Kohonen map;MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure;computer attack classification;computer crime;computer security;self-organizing map;taxonomy;text description,,1,,7,,,10-11 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Distributed IDSs for enhancing Security in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks,"Inverardi, P.; Mostarda, L.; Navarra, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., L''Aquila Univ.","Advanced Information Networking and Applications, 2006. AINA 2006. 20th International Conference on",20060515,2006,2,,116,120,"We present an approach to provide intrusion detection systems (IDS) facilities into wireless sensors networks (WSN). WSNs are usually composed of a large number of low power sensors. They require a careful consumption of the available energy in order to prolong the lifetime of the network. From the security point of view, the overhead added to standard protocols must be as light as possible according to the required security level. Starting from the DESERT tool (P. Inverardi et al., 2005) which has been proposed for component-based software architectures, we derive a new framework that permits to dynamically enforce a set of properties of the sensors behavior. This is accomplished by an IDS specification that is automatically translated into few lines of code installed in the sensors. This realizes a distributed system that locally detects violation of the sensors interactions policies and is able to minimize the information sent among sensors in order to discover attacks over the network",1550-445X,0-7695-2466-4,,10.1109/AINA.2006.145,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620363,,Computer science;Formal specifications;Intelligent networks;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Power system security;Protocols;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks,mobile radio;object-oriented programming;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,WSN;component-based software architecture;distributed IDS;intrusion detection system;mobile wireless sensor network;security enhancement;standard protocol,,3,,7,,,18-20 April 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Third International Conference on",20080122,2007,,,56,56,"In this paper we have approached one problem in development of distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS), namely realization of communications among its nodes. During the last few years, a significant trend towards building of highly distributed IDS systems could be noticed. In this situation a reliable communications solution that would enable updating of signature bases and alert notification is required. We propose use of subscriber-publisher design pattern for this purpose.

iLOC: An invisible LOCalization Attack to Internet Threat Monitoring Systems,Xun Wang; Wei Yu; Xinwen Fu; Dong Xuan; Wei Zhao,"Ohio State Univ., Columbus",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,1930,1938,"In this paper, we study a new class of attacks, the <i>i</i>nvisible <i>LOC</i>alization (<i>iLOC</i>) attack, which can accurately and invisibly localize monitors of Internet threat monitoring (ITM) systems, a class of widely deployed facilities to characterize Internet threats, such as worm propagation, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the <i>iLOC</i> attack, the attacker launches low-rate port-scan traffic, encoded with a selected <i>pseudo-noise</i> <i>code</i> (PN- code), to targeted networks. While the secret PN-code is invisible to others, the attacker can accurately determine the existence of monitors in the targeted networks based on whether the PN-code is embedded in the report data queried from the data center of the ITM system. We conduct extensive simulations on the <i>iLOC</i> attack using real-world traces. Our data demonstrate that the <i>iLOC</i> attack can accurately identify monitors while remaining invisible to the ITM. Finally, we present a set of guidelines to counteract the <i>iLOC</i> attack.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-2025-4,978-1-4244-2026-1,10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.257,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509852,,Algorithm design and analysis;Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer science;Computer worms;Guidelines;Internet;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;invasive software;pseudonoise codes;telecommunication security,Internet threat monitoring systems;denial of service attacks;invisible localization attack;low rate port scan traffic;pseudonoise code;worm propagation,,5,,12,,,13-18 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
