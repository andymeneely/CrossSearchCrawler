They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios.

In this position paper we provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the relation between some popular Android permissions and battery consumption by the device while these permissions are allowed. While battery consumption is an issue in different platforms, we chose to study this on Android because of the user's involvement in the Android permission model.

The goal of this paper is to survey the various threats facing AMIs and the common attack techniques used to realize them in order to identify and understand the requirements for a comprehensive intrusion detection solution. The threat analysis leads to an extensive attack tree that captures the attackers' key objectives (e.g., energy theft) and the individual attack steps (e.g., eavesdropping on the network) that would be involved in achieving them.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication.

The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

Analysis of convergent beam to improve sensor node positioning performance in optics-based WSN,Hyun Cheol Jeon; Chan Gook Park,"Dept. of Mech. & Aerosp. Eng., Seoul Nat.

This system consists of base-station with laser source and sensor nodes with MEMS CCR as a reflector. As a method to position the sensor node, Time of Flight and direction angle between base-station and sensor node are used. The problem in this system is that the intensity of the laser decreases as it propagates forward because of divergence angle and that the reflect area of MEMS CCR is too small to reflect enough power. This makes it hard to measure the TOF and direction angle and as a result the measured distance is very short. To resolve this problem, convergent beam is introduced. The convergent beam has a characteristic that there exists focal point on the optical axis so the beam can be focused on that point. If the focal length is adjusted far away from the base-station, the cross sectional area of the beam decreases as the beam propagates and the intensity of the beam increases enough to use TOF. After this point, the laser beam propagates as like divergent beam. This has the effect that using more powerful laser at nearer to the sensor node. Also by the theoretical analysis of the convergent beam, the offset from the optical axis which can detect MEMS CCR is obtained. To analyze the effect of convergent beam, the beam propagation function is introduced and by this, simulation is conducted.",2093-7121,978-8-9932-1506-9,,10.1109/ICCAS.2014.6987902,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987902,Convergent beam;Localization;MEMS CCR;Positioning;Sensor Node;WSN,Optical sensors;Wireless sensor networks,laser beams;micromechanical devices;optical elements;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks,MEMS CCR;TOF measurement;base-station;convergent beam analysis;corner cube reflector;direction angle;divergence angle;divergent beam;focal length;focal point;laser beam propagation;laser source;microelectromechanical system;optical axis;optics-based WSN;sensor node positioning performance;time of flight;wireless sensor network system,,0,,7,,,22-25 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,

Since CCR is a device which is made up three mutually orthogonal mirrors, an incident ray sent toward CCR can be reflected back in the opposite direction of the incident ray. Using this characteristic, the distance between sensor node and source can be calculated by measuring the difference in detection time of source and sink. However there is a short detection range problem because the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR is not strong enough to be detected. So we analyze reflection process using MEMS CCR and base station, and simulate using analysis of reflected power of ray. And we suggest MEMS CCR array instead of single MEMS CCR to overcome weak power problem and analyze the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR array.

It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations.

Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network.

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods.

Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Mobile Data Management (MDM), 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on",20121110,2012,,,52,62,"The recent surge in popularity of smart handheld devices, including smart-phones and tablets, has given rise to new challenges in protection of Personal Identifiable Information (PII). Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.",,978-1-4673-1796-2,978-0-7695-4713-8,10.1109/MDM.2012.31,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374,Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices,Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones,cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security,Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation,,5,,33,,,23-26 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
On the Detection of Signaling DoS Attacks on 3G Wireless Networks,"Lee, P.P.C.; Bu, T.; Woo, T.","Columbia Univ., New York",INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20070529,2007,,,1289,1297,"Third generation (3G) wireless networks based on the CDMA2000 and UMTS standards are now increasingly being deployed throughout the world. Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.",0743-166X,1-4244-1047-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735,,3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks,3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security,3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation,,18,1,28,,,6-12 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
"Wireless networks for smart surveillance: Technologies, protocol design and experiments","Spadacini, M.; Savazzi, S.; Nicoli, M.; Nicoli, S.","DEI, Politec. di Milano, Milan, Italy","Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW), 2012 IEEE",20120614,2012,,,214,219,"Wireless machine-to-machine (M2M) networks are becoming a relevant topic in the field of home automation and advanced security systems. A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack. Network performance is assessed by experimental measurements using a test-bed operating at 868MHz in an indoor office environment with severe multipath and non line-of-sight propagation conditions.",,978-1-4673-0681-2,,10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215493,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215493,,Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors;Synchronization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;alarm systems;indoor communication;safety systems;surveillance;wireless sensor networks,M2M networks;SimpliciTI radio stack;frequency 868 MHz;indoor intrusion detection;medium access control;multipath propagation;nonline-of-sight propagation;periodic low power monitoring service;protocol design;real time alarm propagation mechanism;smart surveillance;wireless machine-to-machine;wireless network prototype;wireless networks,,0,,14,,,1-1 April 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
Insider Attacker Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks,Fang Liu; Xiuzhen Cheng; Dechang Chen,"George Washington Univ., Washington",INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20070529,2007,,,1937,1945,"Though destructive to network functions, insider attackers are not detectable with only the classic cryptography-based techniques. Many mission-critic sensor network applications demand an effective, light, flexible algorithm for internal adversary identification with only localized information available. The insider attacker detection scheme proposed in this paper meets all the requirements by exploring the spatial correlation existent among the networking behaviors of sensors in close proximity. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors. Our algorithm is purely localized, fitting well to the large-scale sensor networks. Simulation results indicate that internal adversaries can be identified with a high accuracy and a low false alarm rate when as many as 25% sensors are misbehaving.",0743-166X,1-4244-1047-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2007.225,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215807,,Authentication;Batteries;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Cryptography;Data security;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,attacker detection;cryptography-based techniques;internal adversary identification;large-scale sensor networks;spatial correlation;wireless sensor networks,,42,,30,,,6-12 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,,
