Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions.

As cybertampering can disrupt the accuracy of billing information, a well-structured cyberdefense mechanism is required to validate the availability and integrity of metering data for a customer billing center. This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time.

Resilient PHEV charging policies under price information attacks,"Yifan Li; Ran Wang; Ping Wang; Niyato, D.; Saad, W.; Zhu Han","Sch. of Comput. Eng., Nanyang Technol. Univ., Singapore, Singapore","Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm), 2012 IEEE Third International Conference on",20130325,2012,,,389,394,"Enabling a bidirectional energy flow between power grids and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) communications is considered as one of the key components of the future smart grid. On the one hand, the PHEV owner needs to charge its PHEV through the grid, given possibly time-varying electricity pricing schemes. On the other hand, the energy stored in a PHEV can also be sold back to the grid so as to act as an ancillary service while possibly generating revenues to its owner. Consequently, this motivates the need to develop smart charging policies that enable the PHEV owner to optimally decide on when to charge or discharge its vehicle, while minimizing its long-term energy consumption cost. In this paper, we model this PHEV energy management problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved by using a linear programming (LP) technique so as to obtain the optimal charging policy. In particular, we devise optimal charging policies that are resilient to the price information attacks such as denial of service (DoS) attacks and price manipulation attacks over the grid's communication network. We show that, under potential price information attacks, each PHEV can optimize its charging policies given only an estimated price information, which leads to a discrepancy between the real and expected costs. To this end, we analyze this cost difference using the proposed MDP model, which can also guide the system designer and administrator to decide whether reinforcing the system's security is required. The simulation results show that the proposed PHEV charging policy is effective and is adaptable to different PHEV mobility patterns, battery levels and varying electricity prices. It is also demonstrated that improving the system's ability to detect and resolve the attack can obviously reduce the impact brought by the attacks.",,978-1-4673-0910-3,978-1-4673-0909-7,10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486015,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486015,,Batteries;Discharges (electric);Electricity;Energy consumption;Positron emission tomography;Pricing;Roads,Markov processes;battery powered vehicles;energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles;linear programming;power engineering computing;pricing;smart power grids,DoS attacks;G2V communications;LP technique;MDP;Markov decision process;V2G communications;administrator;ancillary service;battery levels;bidirectional energy flow;denial of service attacks;energy management problem;grid communication network;grid-to-vehicle communications;linear programming technique;long-term energy consumption cost minimization;mobility patterns;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;power grids;price information attacks;price manipulation attacks;resilient PHEV charging policies;smart charging policies;smart grid;system designer;system security;time-varying electricity pricing schemes;vehicle-to-grid communications,,3,,11,,,5-8 Nov. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Multigrade security monitoring for ad-hoc wireless networks,"Creti, M.T.; Beaman, M.; Bagchi, S.; Zhiyuan Li; Yung-Hsiang Lu","Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

IEEE 6th International Conference on",20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",,978-1-4244-5113-5,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo.

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area.

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol.

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions.

These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions.

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.",,,,10.1109/WETICE.2014.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927063,Indistinguability;Nonmalleability;Secure Scheduling;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks,Context;Generators;Scheduling;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;quality of service;scheduling;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,communication costs nodes;network lifetime;protocols;quality of service;resource constraints;resource preservation requirement;secure communication infrastructure;secure nodes scheduling algorithm;security framework;wireless sensor networks,,0,,14,,,23-25 June 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Stealthy Attacks in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks: Detection and Countermeasure,"Khalil, I.; Bagchi, S.","Coll. of Inf. Technol., United Arab Emirates Univ., Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110620,2011,10,8,1096,1112,"Stealthy packet dropping is a suite of four attacks-misrouting, power control, identity delegation, and colluding collision-that can be easily launched against multihop wireless ad hoc networks. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.249,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538,KeywordsLocal monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.,Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication,,6,,39,,12/30/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

This autonomous topology of MANET makes it vulnerable against the internal attacks, such as black hole, wormhole, and flooding, from inside the system. One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed. It is shown that the proposed acknowledgement method outperforms NACK with much less packet overhead, by comparing the results of simulations in Network Simulator v-2.35 (NS-2).",0840-7789,978-1-4799-5827-6,,10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129395,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129395,Internal Attacker;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Negative/Selective-Acknowledgement,Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Nickel;Protocols;Routing,mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security,IDS;MANET;Network Simulator v-2.35;SACK;SNACK method;black hole;independent devices;intrusion detection system;lightweight security monitoring;mobile ad-hoc network;packet delivery;selective acknowledgement;selective-negative acknowledgement algorithm;wormhole,,0,,20,,,3-6 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued.

Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks.

Effects of IDSs on the WSNs Lifetime: Evidence of the Need of New Approaches,"Doddapaneni, K.; Ever, E.; Gemikonakli, O.; Mostarda, L.; Navarra, A.","Sch. of Eng. &amp; Inf.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision.

A WSN is a versatile smart sensing system to support pervasive monitoring in a variety of applications. In this context available middleware platforms usually provide the Application Layer with different basic services, as shared memory or addressing repository, but do not usually provide security services such as secure links management protocol or intrusion detection. Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN.

Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol.

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power.

In this paper, we address the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous networks consisting of nodes with different noncorrelated security assets. In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to configure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study. Finally, we evaluate the proposed game theoretical framework via simulations.

Thus, one of the most significant objectives in wireless communication networks is to improve the autonomy of the terminal devices. In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes.

One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets.

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes.

Efficient Multimatch Packet Classification for Network Security Applications,"Fang Yu; Lakshman, T.V.; Motoyama, M.A.; Katz, R.H.","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20061002,2006,24,10,1805,1816,"New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multimatch packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2006.877134,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705613,Energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM),Associative memory;Costs;Counting circuits;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Multiuser detection;Payloads;Random access memory;US Department of Commerce,content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication security,SNORT filter set;SSA;TCAM lookup;multimatch packet classification;network security application;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memory,,11,,32,,,Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Redundancy Management of Multipath Routing for Intrusion Tolerance in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Al-Hamadi, H.; Ing-Ray Chen","Dept. of Comput.

The key concept of our redundancy management is to exploit the tradeoff between energy consumption vs. the gain in reliability, timeliness, and security to maximize the system useful lifetime. We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.",1932-4537,,,10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999,Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security,Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management,energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm,,4,,40,,5/13/2013,Jun-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients.

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel threats are an emerging area for the CPS world. Then, we analyze the performance various sensory channel threats. Moreover, using an iRobot Create as our CPS platform, we exploit simple vulnerable programs on iRobot through its infrared channel.

We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%.

Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used.

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions.

The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes.

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated.

A Moderate to Robust Game Theoretical Model for Intrusion Detection in MANETs,"Otrok, H.; Mohammed, N.; Lingyu Wang; Debbabi, M.; Bhattacharya, P.","Concordia Inst. for Inf. Syst. Eng., Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC","Networking and Communications, 2008. WIMOB '08. IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing,",20081021,2008,,,608,612,"One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively reduce the IDS resource consumption without sacrificing security.",,978-0-7695-3393-3,978-0-7695-3393-3,10.1109/WiMob.2008.21,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654307,Game theory;Intrusion detection systems;MANET security;leader election,Communication system security;Game theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Protection;Robustness;Sampling methods;Switches,Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;probability;telecommunication security,Bayesian game theory;MANET;intrusion detection;leader election;nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model;probability;resource consumption,,2,,12,,,12-14 Oct. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
An integrated testbed for advanced wireless networked control systems technology,"Taylor, J.H.; Slipp, J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Univ. of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada",IECON 2010 - 36th Annual Conference on IEEE Industrial Electronics Society,20101223,2010,,,2101,2106,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained widespread acceptance during the last decade, largely due to the greatly increased flexibility, lower costs and scalability that they have been shown to provide. The pace of application in the context of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) has been somewhat impeded, however, by the reluctance of industry to accept the risks of allowing wireless paths to be incorporated in process control loops. The problem is that there are conflicts between maintaining control loop performance, which can be degraded by many factors, such as low data rates, delays in wireless paths, jitter and electromagnetic interference; and the usual objectives in managing a wireless sensor network, namely freedom to configure the network and to adjust data rates at will, to maximize efficiency and to conserve energy consumption in battery-powered network nodes. In the context of developing advanced controls technology for systems with wireless networks in feedback paths there is a strong need for a test environment that can be used to explore all facets of such systems, including potential problems relating to control loop performance and WSN management. We propose to address this requirement by developing a new testbed for research in WNCSs by adding advanced control agents and process simulators from the Intelligent Control and Asset Management or ICAM project to an existing WSN testbed called the Wireless Industrial Sensor Network Testbed for Radio-Harsh Environments or WINTeR. This testbed has been custom developed for oil and gas industrial environments, i.e., it includes features such as electromagnetic interference and complex multipath propagation. The proposed new testbed, hereafter called WINTeR-ICAM, will include the ICAM Supervisor, ICAM Agents and an additional agent to resolve conflicts between maintaining control loop performance and managing the WSN effectively and efficiently, called a WNCS Coordination Agent or WNCSCA. This age- - nt is designed to be part of an intelligent supervisory control system, and to grant the WSN as much latitude in meeting its objectives as possible while maintaining the performance of control loops that incorporate wireless paths, thus adding to the safety and reliability of future WNCSs. Together, the process simulators, ICAM Agents and WINTeR will provide a powerful new environment for research and development of advanced WNCS technology, with WSN hardware and software in the loop; this novel conception is the contribution of this paper.",1553-572X,978-1-4244-5225-5,978-1-4244-5226-2,10.1109/IECON.2010.5675268,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675268,,Actuators;Communication system security;Data models;Delay;Process control;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,networked control systems;telecommunication control;wireless sensor networks,WNCS coordination agent;advanced wireless networked control systems;battery-powered network nodes;data rate factor;electromagnetic interference factor;jitter factor;radio-harsh environments;wireless industrial sensor network testbed;wireless paths delay factor;wireless sensor networks,,3,,25,,,7-10 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Topology adaptation for robust ad hoc cyberphysical networks under puncture-style attacks,"Ying Liu; Trappe, W.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ, USA",Tsinghua Science and Technology,20150803,2015,20,4,364,375,"Many cyber physical networks will involve ad hoc deployments utilizing peer-to-peer communications. Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network's topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network's overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and th- delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452,Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation,Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology,computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;topology;vehicular ad hoc networks,FVPATA;Fiedler nodes;Fiedler value;Fiedler value power adjustment topology adaption;NS3;OLSR protocol;Puncture-Style Attacks;ad hoc network topology;collision avoidance;graph theory;health-care monitoring;optimized link state routing protocol;peer-to-peer communication;robotic agent;robust ad hoc cyberphysical network;vehicle accident;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network,,0,,,,,Aug-15,,TUP,TUP Journals & Magazine

Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform. It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest.

Sleep-based Topology Control for Wakeup Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Yuanyuan Zhou; Medidi, M.","Washington State Univ., Pullman","Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2007. SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,304,313,"Wireless sensor network applications require both energy-efficiency and low latency for reporting urgent but rare events. Various wakeup scheduling schemes have been proposed to save energy by employing duty cycles and to reduce end-to-end delay by synchronizing nodes' wakeup times and shortening setup latencies. Most sensor applications incur a predominant convergecast traffic pattern in which several close-by sensor nodes simultaneously send reports to the base station, which generates spatially-correlated contention. This contention, specific to sensor networks, can significantly prolong delay, degrade throughput, and impair energy-efficiency. However, most wakeup scheduling and MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks did not address this contention and can be adversely affected. We propose a distributed topology control technique to schedule nodes' wakeup time slots, and design a MAC protocol to benefit from this topology control for improving energy-efficiency and delay, and efficiently handling spatially-correlated contention. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our topology control and MAC can either reduce the end- to-end delay by roughly half or extend the network lifetime by three times, when compared against the nearest competing approach, and achieves twice the throughput under spatially-correlated contention.",,1-4244-1268-4,1-4244-1268-4,10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292842,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292842,,Base stations;Degradation;Delay;Distributed control;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;wireless sensor networks,MAC protocol;distributed topology control;end- to-end delay;sleep-based topology control;wakeup scheduling;wireless sensor networks,,7,,28,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ground truth node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Therefore, defensive techniques such as intrusion detection will need to be deployed in this already complicated system. Deployment and runtime cost due to the defensive trust systems will affect the original function of smart grid system without careful planning and design. This paper is an effort to address this important issue. In particular, the set packing algorithm is used to optimize the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid.

The low cost requirement of the sensor node precludes using an expensive tamper resistant hardware for sensor physical protection. Thus, the adversary can reprogram the compromised sensors and deviates sensor network functionality. In this paper, we propose two simple software-based remote code attestation schemes for different WSN criterion. Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay. Hence, the success of our schemes of attestation does not depend on the accurate measurement of the execution time, which is the main drawback of previously proposed wireless sensor network attestation schemes.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-4148-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425280,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425280,,Costs;Data security;Filling;Hardware;Information security;Laboratories;Protection;Time measurement;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks,protocols;security of data;wireless sensor networks,WSN;channel collision;communication protocols;execution time;memory noise filling;network delay;post deployment noise filling;predeployment noise filling;sensor nodes;software-based remote code attestation;wireless sensor network,,3,,22,,,Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

They demand an accurate location of the event detected and is done by using a mobile beacon node to provide accurate location and assume a benign environment. However, in a hostile military environment, such a node can be easily tampered by an adversary. In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster based anomaly detection scheme by assigning few randomly chosen cluster heads a critical task of estimating the reliability of the mobile beacon node. As localization of remaining nodes is cautiously performed only after verifying the authenticity of the mobile beacon node, a considerable overhead is saved in the incorrect localization of the entire network.

We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic.

Mitigating denial-of-service attacks in MANET by incentive-based packet filtering: A game-theoretic approach,"Xiaoxin Wu; Yau, David K.Y.","Intel Communication Beijing Lab, China","Security and Privacy in Communications Networks and the Workshops, 2007. SecureComm 2007. Third International Conference on",20080624,2007,,,310,319,"Defending against denial-of-service attacks (DoS) in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is challenging because the network topology is dynamic and nodes are selfish. In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead.

A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets.

An Encryption Scheme Using Chaotic Map and Genetic Operations for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Biswas, K.; Muthukkumarasamy, V.; Singh, K.","Sch. of Inf. & Commun.

With the proliferation of sensor networks at home, work place, and beyond, securing data in the network has become a challenge. A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol. We have also performed a number of statistical tests and cryptanalytic attacks to evaluate the security strength of the algorithm and found the cipher provably secure.",1530-437X,,,10.1109/JSEN.2014.2380816,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985604,Chaotic map;Crossover;Data Encryption;Elliptic curve;Mutation;Pseudorandom bit sequence generator;Wireless Sensor Network;Wireless sensor network;chaotic map;crossover;data encryption;elliptic curve;mutation;pseudorandom bit sequence generator,Ciphers;Elliptic curves;Encryption;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks,chaotic communication;computational complexity;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;random sequences;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,KATAN;LED protocol;Mica2 sensor mote;TWINE protocol;XOR;chaotic map parameters;computational complexity;cryptanalytic attacks;cryptographic scheme;data blocks;elliptic curve points;encryption scheme;encryption system;environmental management;genetic operations;industry control;lightweight block cipher;pseudorandom bit sequence;security mechanisms;security strength;statistical tests;strategic surveillance;structural health monitoring;wireless sensor networks,,1,,31,,12/18/2014,May-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Trust-Based Intrusion Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks,Fenye Bao; Ing-Ray Chen; MoonJeong Chang; Jin-Hee Cho,,"Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on",20110728,2011,,,1,6,"We propose a trust-based intrusion detection scheme utilizing a highly scalable hierarchical trust management protocol for clustered wireless sensor networks. Unlike existing work, we consider a trust metric considering both quality of service (QoS) trust and social trust for detecting malicious nodes. By statistically analyzing peer-to-peer trust evaluation results collected from sensor nodes, each cluster head applies trust-based intrusion detection to assess the trustworthiness and maliciousness of sensor nodes in its cluster. Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability. We analyze the sensitivity of false alarms with respect to the minimum trust threshold below which a node is considered malicious.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications.

Watchdog: Reduce time delay for spreading selfish information in manet,"Keerthika, V.; Suganthe, R.C.","Comput. Sci. Eng., Kongu Eng. Coll., Erode, India","Information Communication and Embedded Systems (ICICES), 2013 International Conference on",20130425,2013,,,1104,1107,"Mobile ad hoc networks are composed of mobile nodes connected by wireless links without using any pre-existent infrastructure. The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network.

To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected.

In order to allow the cellular networks to connect these devices reliably to the Internet, the traffic of WSNs should be studied to understand their unique requirements on the cellular infrastructure. This is because the existing cellular networks have been traditionally designed mainly to support human to human communication in which case the traffic is completely different than that of WSNs.

The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades.

Symposium on",20081117,2005,,,105,113,"New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multi-match packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption.

In recent years, much progress has been achieved in developing nano machines supporting our needs in health care and other scenarios. However, experts agree that only the interaction among nano machines allows to address the very complex requirements in the field. Drug delivery and environmental control are only two of the many interesting application domains, which, at the same time, pose many new challenging problems. Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules. Yet, one question has not been considered so far and that is nano communication security, i.e., will it be possible to protect such systems from manipulation by malicious parties? Our objective is to provide some first insights into the security challenges and to highlight some of the open research challenges in this field. The main observation is that especially for molecular communication existing security and cryptographic solutions might not be applicable. In this context, we coin the term biochemical cryptography that might lead to significant improvements in the field of molecular communication.

In this work, instead of constructing a large number of features from massive network traffic, the authors aim to select the most important features and use them to detect intrusions in a fast and effective manner. The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

Third International Conference on",20090821,2009,,,191,196,"Sleep deprivation attacks are still an unsolved but critical problem in sensor networks. They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks.

EEG signals capture important information pertinent to different physiological brain states. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for evaluating the power-accuracy trade-off for EEG-based compressive sensing and classification techniques in the context of epileptic seizure detection in wireless tele-monitoring. The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value.

In this work, we focus the exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.15.4 low rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) MAC layer. This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer.

The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography.

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.",1525-3511,978-1-4244-1997-5,,10.1109/WCNC.2008.493,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524,,Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security,MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes,,9,,14,,,March 31 2008-April 3 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Many of the existing energy efficient routing protocols utilize the power management feature provided by MAC layer (e.g. IEEE 802.11 PSM). The rationale behind these protocols is to power down (put in sleep) the redundant nodes that do not involve in the packets routing. To keep a low end-to-end latency and preserve the routing fidelity, a group of nodes are selected to constitute a virtual backbone throughout the network. The backbone nodes do not sleep all the time serving for the packets routing while the rest of nodes turn to sleep mode if there is no packet to send or receive. Backbone nodes are periodically selected and replaced; the current selection and replacement mechanism mainly concerns the energy balance and fairness among the network nodes while the security threat is not considered. In this paper, we present that the adversary may launch security attacks against the network by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the backbone node selection algorithm. To address this problem, we propose a biased random selection algorithm to prevent the security attacks. The evaluation results indicate that with the aid of reputation system, the proposed biased random selection scheme is more secure than the random selection scheme while trading for a limited amount of power efficiency.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-2324-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.385,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698160,,Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Computer science;Delay;Energy management;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power system management;Protocols;Routing;Spine,access protocols;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security,MAC layer;biased random selection algorithm;energy efficient routing protocol;power saving;secure virtual backbone-based power management;wireless ad hoc network,,0,,14,,,Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust.

Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on",20060123,2006,10,,250a,250a,"Embedded systems present significant security challenges due to their limited resources and power constraints. We propose a novel security architecture for embedded systems (SANES) that leverages the capabilities of reconfigurable hardware to provide efficient and flexible architectural support to both security standards and a range of attacks. This paper shows the efficiency of reconfigurable architecture to implement security primitives within embedded systems. We also propose the use of hardware monitors to detect and defend against attacks. The SANES architecture is based on three main ideas: 1) reconfigurable security primitives, 2) reconfigurable hardware monitors and 3) a hierarchy of security controllers at the primitive, system and executive level. Results are presented for a reconfigurable AES security primitive within the IPSec standard and highlight the interest of such a solution.",1530-1605,0-7695-2507-5,,10.1109/HICSS.2006.409,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579811,,Batteries;Computer architecture;Computer security;Data privacy;Data security;Embedded system;Hardware;Power system security;Protocols;Reconfigurable architectures,,,,3,,22,,,04-07 Jan. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Detecting Forged Acknowledgements in MANETs,"Nan Kang; Shakshuki, E.M.; Sheltami, T.R.","Jodrey Sch. of Comput. Sci., Acadia Univ., Wolfville, NS, Canada","Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA), 2011 IEEE International Conference on",20110505,2011,,,488,494,"Over the past few years, with the trend of mobile computing, Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) has become one of the most important wireless communication mechanisms among all. Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET. The purpose of this paper is to present an improved version of EAACK called EAACK2 that performs better in the presence of false misbehavior and partial dropping.",1550-445X,978-1-61284-313-1,978-0-7695-4337-6,10.1109/AINA.2011.84,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763422,DSA;Digital Signature;EAACK;MANET,Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Encryption;Mobile computing;Public key;Receivers,mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,DSA;EAACK scheme;MANET;digital signature algorithm;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;forged acknowledgement detection;mobile ad hoc network;wireless communication mechanisms,,5,1,24,,,22-25 March 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination).

That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors.

E-STAR combines payment and trust systems with a trust-based and energy-aware routing protocol. The payment system rewards the nodes that relay others' packets and charges those that send packets. The trust system evaluates the nodes' competence and reliability in relaying packets in terms of multi-dimensional trust values. The trust values are attached to the nodes' public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions. We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss of trust will result in loss of future earnings. Moreover, for the efficient implementation of the trust system, the trust values are computed by processing the payment receipts. Analytical results demonstrate that E-STAR can secure the payment and trust calculation without false accusations.

The field has become interesting and problems look even more exciting to solve ever since organizations have been trying to tame large volumes of complex and fast arriving Big Data streams through newer computing paradigms. However, extracting meaningful and actionable information from Big Data is a challenging and daunting task. The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists.

While introducing duty cycled communications can yield large power savings it does so at the cost of increased delay and decreased throughput. Many WSNs may incorporate several distinct message types of varying priority. A node with a high priority message to send may find the channel to be busy with a lesser priority message from another node and must therefore dasiaback-offpsila leading to further delays. In a multi-hop environment, these delays are compounded and may become unacceptably large.

Distributed Authentication of Program Integrity Verification in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Chang, K.; Shin, K.G.","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput.

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops.

Trust Management for Encounter-Based Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks,Ing-Ray Chen; Fenye Bao; MoonJeong Chang; Jin-Hee Cho,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010), 2010 IEEE",20110110,2010,,,1,6,"We propose and analyze a class of trust management protocols for encounter-based routing in delay tolerant networks (DTNs). The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235,,Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols,Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes,DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol,,21,,15,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is lightweight due to the monitor nodes were not loaded with any ordinary nodes or BS. Moreover, the proposed mechanism does not cause the communication overhead.",,978-4-907764-34-0,978-4-907764-33-3,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334764,detecting sinkhole attacks;intruder detection;security in wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks,Bandwidth;Communication system security;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,RSSI;base station;communication system;extra monitor node;intrusion detection;node capture;physical attack;received signal strength indicator;security system;sinkhole attack detection;tampering;wireless sensor network,,0,,19,,,18-21 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The judging rules of the aggressive behavior are summarized in this model according to the different offensive features in routing layer. Moreover, the log is established according to IP packets in routing layer, and the fuzzy evaluation to the data is carried on. On the base of this, a way to enhance the correct rate of the detection by joint detection mechanism of multi-point cooperation has been introduced in this paper. To distribute the network resource dynamically and reasonably, all nodes are treated dynamically with safety classification.

A Stochastic Game Model for Jamming in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Systems,"Quanyan Zhu; Husheng Li; Zhu Han; Bas&#x0327;ar, T.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

In this paper, we introduce a stochastic zero-sum game model to study the strategies. Primary users, secondary users and jammers are the three types of agents in the system. The primary users dictate the system states and their transitions while the secondary users and jammers behave non-cooperatively to achieve their goals independently under different system environment. Our Markovian game model captures not only the zero-sum interactions between secondary users and the jammers but also the dynamics of the system. Our results indicate that the secondary users can enhance their security level or increase their long-term payoff by either improving their sensing capabilities to confuse the jammer with the choice or choosing to communicate under states where the available channels are less prone to jamming. In the numerical experiments, we point out that the payoff of the secondary users increases with the number of available jamming-free channels and is eventually limited by the behavior of primary users.",1550-3607,978-1-4244-6402-9,,10.1109/ICC.2010.5502451,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502451,,Cognitive radio;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Emulation;Frequency;Jamming;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication,Markov processes;cognitive radio;jamming;stochastic games;wireless channels,Markovian game model;antijamming scenario;jamming-free channels;multichannel cognitive radio systems;stochastic zero-sum game model;zero-sum interactions,,12,,20,,,23-27 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A novel coalition game theory based resource allocation and selfish attack avoidance in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks,"Gohila, G.V.S.; Velayudham, A.","Cape Inst. of Technol., Levengipuram, India","Sustainable Energy and Intelligent Systems (SEISCON 2013), IET Chennai Fourth International Conference on",20150611,2013,,,517,821,"Cognitive radio (CR) is an intelligent radio, which is target to exploit the utmost available spectrum holes for unlicensed users by sensing the environment. The arrival of advanced wireless communication device leads to demand in the spectrum and the need to improve utilization of vacant spectrum. In the past decade the spectrum sensing and allocation has been the main focus of research than security in cognitive radio. A selfish cognitive radio node is a serious security issue which occupies a part or full resources (pre-occupation problem) in the multiple channel, and forbids other legitimate cognitive nodes from consuming the resources. This self-centered cognitive radio can critically degrade the performance of the network; so a skillful resource allocation strategy should adopted in order to avoid these selfish attacks in the network. The conventional resource allocation approaches in cognitive network are fully dependent. In this scheme, a coalition game theory used to avoid these selfish attacks with multiple PU's and multiple SU's. The proposed approaches consist of multiple PU's and SU's gathered on a set, in which PU allows the other SU's to make use of its resources in contract or agreement on a timely basis. The PU makes decision to select the optimal SU based on their channel status and the SU act as a relay to PU and help the PU in their transmission of data. This scheme adopts efficient resource allocation in a multichannel cooperative manner due to emerging of many cooperative communication devices. This proposed system follows the core concept and also support shapley value to equally distribute the payoff throughout the users in the network. By this resource allocation approach, the selfish attacks can be prevented in the system and thereby increase the resource utilization efficiency in the network",,978-1-78561-030-1,,10.1049/ic.2013.0363,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119750,CRAHN;Shapley value;coalitional game theory;cognitive radio;core;selfish attacks,,ad hoc networks;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;signal detection;telecommunication security,CR;Shapley value;advanced wireless communication device;coalition game theory based resource allocation strategy;cognitive radio ad-hoc networks;cooperative communication devices;intelligent radio;multiple PU;multiple SU;resource utilization efficiency;self-centered cognitive radio;selfish attack avoidance;selfish cognitive radio node;spectrum holes;spectrum sensing,,0,,,,,12-14 Dec. 2013,,IET,IET Conference Publication

Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time, it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as 1 and the other is marked as 0. During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform.

Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated.

On the Effectiveness of Monitoring for Intrusion Detection in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Boppana, R.V.; Xu Su","Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.210,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919,Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.,Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement,Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration,,3,,32,,11/9/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Centered Hyperspherical and Hyperellipsoidal One-Class Support Vector Machines for Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks,"Rajasegarar, S.; Leckie, C.; Bezdek, J.C.; Palaniswami, M.","Dept. of Electr. & Electron.

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231,Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks,Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks,learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks,anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks,,35,,52,,6/10/2010,Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks.

These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency.

Nonetheless, with the development of the smart grid, how to determine the quantity of electricity and at what price in a step-like fashion has not been fully investigated in the past. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce two types of MEP models: a one-dimensional MEP model and a two-dimensional MEP model, which can be used to formally analyze and determine the desirable quantities of electricity and pricing in multiple steps. Particularly, in the one-dimensional MEP model, the steps are scaled only by the quantity of electricity whereas in the two-dimensional MEP model, the steps are scaled by both the quantity of electricity and the time when the electricity is used. Based on the proposed MEP models, we further investigate the vulnerability of the electricity market operation and investigate false data injection attacks against electricity prices and charges to consumers. Through an extensive simulation study, our data shows that the proposed MEP models can achieve fairness in electricity consumption, balance loads between peak and non-peak times, and improve electricity resource utilization. Our data also indicates that false data injection attacks can only partially compromise prices in our MEP models, leading to a limited impact on users charges.",1045-9219,,,10.1109/TPDS.2015.2388479,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004067,Electricity market;Fairness of electricity consumption;False data injection attacks;Load balance;Multistep electricity price;fairness of electricity consumption;false data injection attacks;load balance;multistep electricity price,Data models;Electricity;Electricity supply industry;Energy conservation;Load management;Load modeling;Smart grids,,,,0,,,,1/7/2015,Jan. 1 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

ERESS is based on Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET) and aims to reduce the number of victims in panic-type disasters. This system consists of new mobile terminals (handset size) with advanced disaster recognition algorithm and acquires sensor information such as acceleration, direction difference and walking steps. Collected information about them is used for detecting the occurrence of a disaster. However, until now, there is no suitable information spreading method for ERESS to collect their information effectively.

Proceedings. 19th IEEE International",20050418,2005,,,41a,41a,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensors' locations play a critical role in many applications. Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies.

The performance of multiuser selection scheme is evaluated in two cases: in the absence of interference and in the presence of multiuser interference (MUI). In the former case, the closed-form capacity outage probability as well as the numerical values of the bit error rate (BER) are obtained via the probability density function (PDF) of signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classic indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channel. In the latter case, the multiuser interference cancellation coefficient as a random variable is added for the calculation of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). In addition, due to free space path loss and log-normal shadowing, the sum of MUI is treated as another log-normal-distributed random variable by exploiting central limit theorem.

Technol., Anna Univ., Chennai, India","Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT), 2011 International Conference on",20110804,2011,,,561,566,This paper presents an efficient image retrieval system called BICA-C for face recognition. This system takes an image as an input query and retrieves images based on its image content. Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is an approach for retrieving semantically-relevant images from an image database based on extracted image features. Block Independent Component Analysis (B-ICA) is a popular feature extraction method. This paper proposes a scheme to enhance the performance of B-ICA based feature extraction by the utilization of k-means clustering technique. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. First stage is the offline training process where the extracted features in the database is clustered using k-means clustering and then the second stage is the online testing where the obtained query image is compared with the clustered images and is classified as intruder or authenticated person based on the similarity measure.,,978-1-4577-0588-5,,10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972434,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972434,Block Independent Component Analysis (B-ICA);Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR);Face Recognition;K-means clustering,Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Training,content-based retrieval;face recognition;feature extraction;image retrieval;independent component analysis;pattern clustering,BICA-C;authenticated person;block independent component analysis;content based image retrieval;face detection;face recognition;image content;image database;image feature extraction;intruder;k-means clustering technique;offline training process;online testing;query image;semantically relevant image retrieval,,1,,11,,,3-5 June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

PayLess: A low cost network monitoring framework for Software Defined Networks,"Chowdhury, S.R.; Bari, M.F.; Ahmed, R.; Boutaba, R.","David R. Cheriton Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), 2014 IEEE",20140619,2014,,,1,9,"Software Defined Networking promises to simplify network management tasks by separating the control plane (a central controller) from the data plane (switches). OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework.

We describe a protocol, named Reliability Map Routing (RMR), which uses end-to-end Quality of Service metrics that include spatial reliability and trust. The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347,Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust,Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols,military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability,QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load,,2,,30,,,Dec-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.",,978-1-4673-4865-2,,10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224,Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network,Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks,DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network,,0,,13,,,3-5 April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks.

Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer.

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission.

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 W output power to the IOT smart nodes.

In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack.

Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one.

Moreover, SDN can facilitate the creation of new network applications that previously, with traditional networks, were more complex to be implemented. To illustrate the benefits of the use of SDN in SCADA, we designed a mechanism that aims to prevent a possible eavesdropper from fully capturing communication flows between SCADA components.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE).

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS.

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages.

We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes.

CompactDFA: Scalable Pattern Matching Using Longest Prefix Match Solutions,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya, Israel","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20140417,2014,22,2,415,428,"A central component in all contemporary intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is their pattern matching algorithms, which are often based on constructing and traversing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that represents the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states.

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152,,Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils,content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data,NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories,,1,,12,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties.

We present a novel lookup technique and architecture to decrease the power consumption of multi-hashing schemes, predominantly Bloom filters, in hardware. The theoretical analysis has shown that power gain achieved through new lookup technique can go up to 90%. Simulation results with three different classes of the hash functions embedded into the Bloom filter have indicated that power consumption of the Bloom filters can be considerably decreased by employing the low power lookup technique",,0-7695-2533-4,,10.1109/ISVLSI.2006.3,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1602437,,Application software;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Power filters,computer networks;cryptography;digital filters;low-power electronics;table lookup;telecommunication security,Bloom filters;hash functions;low power lookup technique;multihashing network;multihashing schemes,,4,,10,,,2-3 March 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Reinvented Fuzzy logic Secure Media Access Control Protocol (FSMAC) to improve lifespan of Wireless Sensor Networks,"Thorat, S.S.; Markande, S.D.","Dept. of Electron. & Telecommun., Smt. Kashibai Navale Coll. of Eng., Pune, India","Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), 2014 International Conference on",20140403,2014,,,344,349,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have grown in size and importance in a very short time. WSN is very sensitive to various attacks, hence Security has become prominent issue in WSNs. Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attack is one of main concern for WSNs. DOS Attack diminishes the resources of sensor nodes which affect the normal functioning of the node. Media Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for communication within multiple access networks and incorporates shared medium. Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media Access Control (FSMAC) Protocol gives good solution against DOS Attack. It detects all intrusion taking place and also decreases average energy consumed by the sensor network than in attacked scenario. These results are responsible for increase in the lifespan of a sensor network. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty for human reasoning and decision making. Innovational use of Fuzzy logic theory is applied to this FSMAC protocol to enhance the performance. Here in this paper, Reinvention in FSMAC protocol is proposed using new intrusion detector parameters like No of times node sensed channel free and Variation in channel sense period. Performance of new protocol is tested on the basis of time of first node dead and average energy consumed by the sensor node. These results show that the lifespan of sensor network increases and average energy consumed by sensor node decreases.",,,,10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781305,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781305,Denial-Of-Service (DOS) Attack;Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media access Control Protocol (FSMAC);Media Access Control (MAC) Protocol;Security Issues;Wireless Sensor Networks,Frequency division multiaccess;Indexes;Protocols;Receivers;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;cryptographic protocols;decision making;energy consumption;fuzzy logic;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,DOS attack;FSMAC protocol;WSN improvement;decision making;denial of service;energy consumption;fuzzy logic secure media access control protocol;human reasoning;intrusion detector parameter;multiple access networks;sensor nodes;uncertainty handling;wireless sensor network,,0,,17,,,7-8 Feb. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Distributed IDSs for enhancing Security in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks,"Inverardi, P.; Mostarda, L.; Navarra, A.","Dept. of Comput.

AINA 2006. 20th International Conference on",20060515,2006,2,,116,120,"We present an approach to provide intrusion detection systems (IDS) facilities into wireless sensors networks (WSN). WSNs are usually composed of a large number of low power sensors. They require a careful consumption of the available energy in order to prolong the lifetime of the network. From the security point of view, the overhead added to standard protocols must be as light as possible according to the required security level. Starting from the DESERT tool (P. Inverardi et al., 2005) which has been proposed for component-based software architectures, we derive a new framework that permits to dynamically enforce a set of properties of the sensors behavior. This is accomplished by an IDS specification that is automatically translated into few lines of code installed in the sensors. This realizes a distributed system that locally detects violation of the sensors interactions policies and is able to minimize the information sent among sensors in order to discover attacks over the network",1550-445X,0-7695-2466-4,,10.1109/AINA.2006.145,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620363,,Computer science;Formal specifications;Intelligent networks;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Power system security;Protocols;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks,mobile radio;object-oriented programming;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,WSN;component-based software architecture;distributed IDS;intrusion detection system;mobile wireless sensor network;security enhancement;standard protocol,,3,,7,,,18-20 April 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

An adaptive multi-channel approach for real-time multimedia wireless sensor networks,"Cabezas, A.C.; Pena T, N.M.; Labrador, M.A.","Dept. of Electr. & Electron. Eng., Univ. de los Andes-Bogota, Bogota, Colombia","Communications, 2009. LATINCOM '09. IEEE Latin-American Conference on",20091030,2009,,,1,6,"Many wireless sensor network applications could be substantially improved if they enhance the description of the events transmitting scalar sensor data along with audio and video. For example, an intrusion detection system would reduce the number of false positives if, in addition to the alarm, the system would also transmitted a picture or video of the intruder. The problem is how to overcome the known limitations of current wireless sensor networks to support multimedia applications in terms of throughput, delay and jitter while being energy efficient. This paper presents LEMR-multichannel, an extension of LEMR for real-time applications over wireless sensor networks to address these issues. LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energy-efficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMR-multichannel in terms of these performance metrics when compared with well-known protocols, such as LEMR, SMAC, TMAC and SCP-MAC.",,978-1-4244-4387-1,978-1-4244-4388-8,10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305150,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305150,Energy;Jitter;Latency;MAC;Multimedia;Network;Routing;Sensor;Wireless,Access protocols;Acoustic sensors;Data engineering;Delay;Energy efficiency;Jitter;Media Access Protocol;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks,jitter;multimedia communication;transceivers;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks,LEMR-multichannel;adaptive multichannel;multimedia application;network delay;network jitter;network throughput;real-time multimedia wireless sensor network;scalar sensor data;throughput capability;transceiver device,,1,,15,,,10-11 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
