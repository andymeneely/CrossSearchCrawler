Adaptive energy scheme adjusts the range of transmission of each node based on the maximum distance between nodes in each cluster.

A Hybrid TCAM + SRAM Scheme for Multi-match Packet Classification,Ransheng Shen; Xianfeng Li; Hui Li,"Sch. of Comput. & Inf.

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.",,978-0-7695-4879-1,,10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360,SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification,Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory,SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures,NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution,,1,,11,,,14-16 Dec. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
A Moderate to Robust Game Theoretical Model for Intrusion Detection in MANETs,"Otrok, H.; Mohammed, N.; Lingyu Wang; Debbabi, M.; Bhattacharya, P.","Concordia Inst. for Inf. Syst. Eng., Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC","Networking and Communications, 2008. WIMOB '08. IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing,",20081021,2008,,,608,612,"One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively reduce the IDS resource consumption without sacrificing security.",,978-0-7695-3393-3,978-0-7695-3393-3,10.1109/WiMob.2008.21,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654307,Game theory;Intrusion detection systems;MANET security;leader election,Communication system security;Game theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Protection;Robustness;Sampling methods;Switches,Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;probability;telecommunication security,Bayesian game theory;MANET;intrusion detection;leader election;nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model;probability;resource consumption,,2,,12,,,12-14 Oct. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Effects of IDSs on the WSNs Lifetime: Evidence of the Need of New Approaches,"Doddapaneni, K.; Ever, E.; Gemikonakli, O.; Mostarda, L.; Navarra, A.","Sch. of Eng. &amp; Inf.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision.

Redundancy Management of Multipath Routing for Intrusion Tolerance in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Al-Hamadi, H.; Ing-Ray Chen","Dept. of Comput.

We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN.

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH.

ISSNIP 2007. 3rd International Conference on",20080425,2007,,,335,340,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a new technology foreseen to be used increasingly in the near future due to their data acquisition and data processing abilities. Security for WSNs is an area that needs to be considered in order to protect the functionality of these networks, the data they convey and the location of their members. The security models and protocols used in wired and other networks are not suited to WSNs because of their severe resource constraints, especially concerning energy . In this article, we propose a centralized intrusion detection scheme based on support vector machines (SVMs) and sliding windows. We find that our system can detect black hole attacks and selective forwarding attacks with high accuracy without depleting the nodes of their energy.",,978-1-4244-1501-4,978-1-4244-1502-1,10.1109/ISSNIP.2007.4496866,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4496866,,Australia;Bandwidth;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Protocols;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks,support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,SVM;centralized intrusion detection scheme;data acquisition;data processing;selective forwarding attacks;sliding windows;support vector machines;wireless sensor networks,,17,,21,,,3-6 Dec. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Stealthy Attacks in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks: Detection and Countermeasure,"Khalil, I.; Bagchi, S.","Coll. of Inf. Technol., United Arab Emirates Univ., Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110620,2011,10,8,1096,1112,"Stealthy packet dropping is a suite of four attacks-misrouting, power control, identity delegation, and colluding collision-that can be easily launched against multihop wireless ad hoc networks. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.249,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538,KeywordsLocal monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.,Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication,,6,,39,,12/30/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine
A Secure Routing Protocol for Clustered Sensor Networks,Zhiqiang Ruan; Qiaoliang Li; Sujun Li,"Sch. of Comput. & Commun., Hunan Univ., Changsha","Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, 2008. WiCOM '08. 4th International Conference on",20081118,2008,,,1,4,"Numerous cluster-based key management schemes have been proposed to secure sensor networks. Nevertheless, most existing schemes did not take the legitimacy of the cluster- head into consideration, which might highly vulnerable to several attacks such as sinkhole; wormhole and selective-forwarding, besides, the network should deal with an addition of new nodes and deletion of nodes being captured. In this paper, a modification of dynamic rekeying distribution was presented to secure communication in cluster-based protocols. All the communications in the protocols are properly authenticated using elliptic curve digital signature scheme. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposal SRC (secure rotation of cluster-head) is more energy-efficient compared to Sec-LEACH and GS-LEACH and have better scalability as well as resilience to node capture.",,978-1-4244-2107-7,978-1-4244-2108-4,10.1109/WiCom.2008.957,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4678865,,Base stations;Computer network management;Computer networks;Digital signatures;Energy capture;Energy efficiency;Routing protocols;Scalability;Security;Wireless sensor networks,routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,clustered sensor networks;elliptic curve digital signature scheme;key management schemes;routing protocol;selective-forwarding;wormhole,,0,,11,,,12-14 Oct. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper we propose SSBCR (Secured Sector Based Bi-path Clustering and Routing) protocol that takes both these two issues into consideration. It uses a bi-path routing algorithm to decrease the computational overhead as well as energy dissipation in the nodes. A key pre-distribution scheme is proposed such that nodes in the route share keys while those that are not in the route do not share keys with nodes that are in the route. Simulations have been done for both small and large areas, low and high density, on-route and non-route connectivity scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol not only provides security but also maximizes sensor network lifetime and achieves a high probability of connectivity, particularly when the network is large.",,978-1-4673-2172-3,,10.1109/TrustCom.2012.254,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296048,Sensor Networks;routing;security,Base stations;Clustering algorithms;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks,computer network security;pattern clustering;probability;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks,SSBCR;WSN;computational overhead;connectivity probability;high-density connectivity scenarios;key predistribution scheme;key sharing;large-area connectivity scenarios;low-density connectivity scenarios;node energy dissipation;nonroute connectivity scenarios;on-route connectivity scenarios;secured sector-based bipath clustering and routing protocol;small-area connectivity scenarios;wireless sensor network lifetime maximization,,1,,20,,,25-27 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A semi-reliable energy-efficient retransmission mechanism based on the sensing relevancies of source nodes for wireless image sensor networks,"Costa, D.G.; Guedes, L.A.; Vasques, F.; Portugal, P.; Valle, O.T.","Dept. of Technol., State Univ. of Feira de Santana, Feira de Santana, Brazil","Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS), 2012 International Symposium on",20121025,2012,,,506,510,"Whenever reliable transmissions are assured by retransmission mechanisms, higher packet error incur in additional energy consumption due to packet retransmissions, even though many monitoring applications can tolerate some loss in the quality of the received images. In fact, visual information retrieved from source nodes may have different relevancies for the applications, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view. We propose a semi-reliable energy-efficient hop-by-hop retransmission mechanism, where the reliability level of each packet is function of the relevance of the source nodes associated with DWT subbands. Doing so, some of the corrupted packets will not be retransmitted, saving energy of intermediate nodes with low impact to the visual monitoring quality.",2154-0217,978-1-4673-0761-1,978-1-4673-0760-4,10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328419,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6328419,energy-efficient retransmission;error control;sensing relevance;wireless image sensor networks,Discrete wavelet transforms;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Sensors;Strontium;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks,discrete wavelet transforms;multimedia communication;telecommunication network reliability;visual communication;wireless sensor networks,DWT subbands;corrupted packets;discrete wavelet transform;energy consumption;intermediate nodes;packet error;packet reliability level;packet retransmissions;received image quality;semireliable energy-efficient hop-by-hop retransmission mechanism;sensing relevancies;source nodes;transmission reliability;visual information retrieval;visual monitoring quality;wireless image sensor networks,,0,,11,,,28-31 Aug. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
