The processing speed of one IDS cannot achieve the throughput requirement in the core networks because of the pattern matching, the key operation for signature-based IDS, is complex and time consuming. In this paper, it argues that if the signature set is shared by multiple IDSs, a packet needs to be checked once and once only by one of the IDSs, so traffic load can be redistributed among the IDSs to avoid local congestion. Packet marking is used to indicate the status of this packet utilized by collaborative IDSs, and a redistribution strategy named inner logical ring (ILR) is built among IDSs to redistribute the traffic load. Meanwhile, caching scheme is used to keep sequence for packets belonging to the same flow. This collaborative distributed IDS is robust with rapid response to various attacks, and the detection throughput is significantly increased from the throughput of the weakest IDS to the summation of all the collaborative IDSs.",,978-0-7695-3431-2,,10.1109/FGCN.2008.67,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4734082,attack detection;collaborative detection;pattern matching;signature-based;traffic load distribution,Computer science;Computer viruses;Computer worms;IP networks;International collaboration;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,Internet;groupware;security of data,Internet users protection;caching scheme;collaborative distributed intrusion detection system;signature-based intrusion detection system;traffic load,,1,,12,,,13-15 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Situation Awareness Measurement Enhanced for Efficient Monitoring in the Internet of Things,"Gendreau, A.A.","Comput. Sci. & Comput. Inf. Syst, St. Leo Univ., St. Leo, FL, USA","Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP), 2015 IEEE",20150727,2015,,,82,85,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a heterogeneous network of objects that communicate with each other and their owners over the Internet. In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.",,,,10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243,Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks,Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks,Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks,Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks,,0,,12,,,13-15 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

In this paper, an intrusion detection feature extraction method based on the complex network theory and the MST algorithm is proposed. The method takes the features of the network connections as nodes of a scale-free model, then detects the clusters of the network and extracts the key nodes of the model. The extracted nodes can be used in the IDS to detect the existence of intrusions. The result shows that the detection rate of the method is almost 1 percent lower than that of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, but the efficiency is improved by 13 percent.

Using this approach an engineer specifies certain hard and soft performance requirements for a multi-processor system, and allows it to be generated automatically by competitive evolution/optimisation, thus obviating the need for detailed design. To make the proposal concrete, we use the Intel IXP1200 network processor as a baseline complex system design and show how various improvements can be make to this architecture by evolutionary/competitive design. Various approaches to multi- objective optimisation (Darwin, Lamarck Baldwin, etc.) are compared and contrasted in their ability to generate architectures meeting various constraints. We also present an assessment of a proposed architecture with reference to four different packet processing roles.

Ultra-high throughput string matching for Deep Packet Inspection,"Kennedy, A.; Xiaojun Wang; Zhen Liu; Bin Liu","Sch. of Electron. Eng., Dublin City Univ., Dublin, Ireland","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2010",20100429,2010,,,399,404,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) involves searching a packet's header and payload against thousands of rules to detect possible attacks. The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets.

For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device.

An Efficient Task Allocation Protocol for P2P Multi-agent Systems,Dayong Ye; Quan Bai; Minjie Zhang; Khin Than Win; Zhiqi Shen,"Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Software Eng., Univ. of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia","Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, 2009 IEEE International Symposium on",20090818,2009,,,11,18,"Recently, task allocation in multi-agent systems has been investigated by many researchers. Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.",,978-0-7695-3747-4,,10.1109/ISPA.2009.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966,,Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness,multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation,P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment,,2,,16,,,10-12 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
SWAT: small world-based attacker traceback in ad-hoc networks,"Kim, Y.; Helmy, A.","Electr. Eng.

The Second Annual International Conference on",20051121,2005,,,85,96,"Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) provide a lot of promise for many practical applications. However, MANETs are vulnerable to a number of attacks due to its autonomous nature. DoS/DDoS attacker traceback is especially challenging in MANETs for the lack of infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an efficient on-the-fly search technique, SWAT, to trace back DoS and DDoS attackers in MANETs. Our scheme borrows from small worlds, utilizes the concept of contacts, and use traffic pattern matching (TPM) and traffic volume matching (TVM) techniques.

New ICT and e-Learning strategies and advances in wireless standards and technologies- particularly in the areas of Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and mobile computing can help to bridge the digital divide in education and research. Using open broadband Wireless technologies and implementing mobile computing architectures, one can overcome the challenges of ground, infrastructure, and finance to increase access; deploy broadband quickly and cost-effectively to areas currently not served; and extend the benefits of digital revolution to previously unreachable populations. These technologies aim to provide low-cost, high-performance Wireless access to residential and business applications. As technology evolves to address portable and mobile applications, the required features and performance of the system will increase. Evolution toward the phase called full mobility provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds.

Downlink capacity optimization in a heterogeneous home area network with application to smart grid,Zhuo Li; Qilian Liang,"Dept. of Electr. Eng., Univ. of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA","Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2014 IEEE",20150212,2014,,,4677,4682,"This paper studies the optimization problem of total downlink capacity in heterogeneous multiuser Home Area Network (HAN) for Smart Grid application, where beamforming technique is employed at the smart meter. Based on the proposed system model, an optimal downlink power allocation scheme is proposed under the constraints that 1) each user should satisfy individual signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) requirement for successful heterogeneous communication; 2) the sum of transmit power allocated to each user is equal to the permissible total transmit power at the smart meter; 3) allocated transmit power to each user is feasible. By employing the theorem that the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables follows Erlang distribution, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the smallest allocated transmit power is mathematically obtained from the properties of downlink indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channels. Numerical results show that the total downlink capacity is greatly enhanced by the proposed power allocation scheme.

This paper presents an intelligent control system based on artificial immune system architecture to maintain the thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. Specifically, a residential building is regarded as a human body and a comfortable thermal environment means the healthy state of body. Whenever outside factors disturb this state, which is analogous to the intrusion of pathogens, the immune system will work automatically to eliminate them and therefore to keep the proper state of the body.

Enhancing the Reliability and Security of the Information Infrastructure Used to Manage the Power System,"Cleveland, Frances","IEEE Member, PES-PSCC","Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2007. IEEE",20070723,2007,,,1,8,"In the power industry, the focus has been almost exclusively on implementing equipment that can keep the power system reliable. Until recently, communications and information flows have been considered of peripheral importance. However, increasingly the information infrastructure that supports the monitoring and control of the power system has come to be critical to the reliability of the power system. Communication protocols are one of the most critical parts of power system operations, responsible for retrieving information from field equipment and, vice versa, for sending control commands. Despite their key function, to-date these communication protocols have rarely incorporated any security measures, including security against inadvertent errors, power system equipment malfunctions, communications equipment failures, or deliberate sabotage. Since these protocols were very specialized, security by obscurity has been the primary approach. However, security by obscurity is no longer a valid concept. In particular, the electricity market is pressuring market participants to gain any edge they can. A tiny amount of information can turn a losing bid into a winning bid - or withholding that information from your competitor can make their winning bid into a losing bid. And the desire to disrupt power system operations can stem from careless mistakes, to simple teenager bravado, to competitive game-playing in the electrical marketplace, and even to actual terrorism. As the power industry relies increasingly on information to operate the power system, two infrastructures must now be managed: not only the power system infrastructure, but also the information infrastructure. The management of the power system infrastructure has become reliant on the information infrastructure as automation continues to replace manual operations, as market forces demand more accurate and timely information, and as the power system equipment ages. Therefore, the reliability of the power sys- - tem is increasingly affected by any problems that the information infrastructure might suffer.

"RFAP, a preventive measure against route request Flooding Attack in MANETS","Laeeq, K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Fed. Urdu Univ. of Arts, Karachi, Pakistan","Multitopic Conference (INMIC), 2012 15th International",20130502,2012,,,480,487,"The operations of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are still insecure due to some reasons. One of the main reasons is insecure routing protocol. Generally ad-hoc network operations utilize reactive routing protocol such as AODV, to complete their routing needs. The route construction phase of this protocol is vulnerable; the malicious node easily disrupts the communication. In one case malicious node sends bulk route request (RREQ) packets to void addresses that occupy the network resources. This type of attack is called RREQ Flooding Attack (RFA). There are various schemes to mitigate the RFA but they are inadequate towards mitigating the attack. One of the main issues present in majority of proposed solutions is not to recover malicious node after punishment. This paper introduces RFAP, a scheme for mitigating the RREQ flooding attack in MANET by utilizing AODV protocol. The RFAP is an amended form of AODV. The scheme is specially design for MANET that has higher node mobility. Recovery of malicious nodes after reasonable punishment is the main objective of the scheme. Simulations are performed using NS-2 simulator and results are presented. These results illustrate that RFAP has ability to separate the flooder node from the network with more reliable as compare to simple AODV.",,978-1-4673-2249-2,,10.1109/INMIC.2012.6511487,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511487,AODV;Attack;Flooding attack;MANETs;RFAP;Reactive Routing,,mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols,AODV;MANET;RFAP;RREQ packets;bulk route request;mobile ad-hoc networks;preventive measure;reactive routing protocol;route request flooding attack,,1,,30,,,13-15 Dec. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The pulses are transmitted off-chip by the address event representation (AER) protocol, i.e. via a digital bus as the identifying address of the sending pixel. For the motion pixels, this read-out strategy has the advantage of low latency in the order of 100 ns after a change is encountered. (Whereas a scanning read-out strategy would on average suffer a delay of half of the frame scanning period.) Mounted on a pan-tilt system, the peripheral motion detectors could, for instance, be used to steer the imager such that the image of a moving object falls onto the central pixel array where it can then be examined in detail at a higher resolution. Or, if the imager is mounted statically, they can detect an intruder and cause the central pixels to be turned on for more detailed observation",,0-7803-8834-8,,10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465196,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1465196,,Delay;Frequency;Image resolution;Motion detection;Nervous system;Neurons;Object detection;Pixel;Protocols;Voltage,image resolution;image sensors;motion measurement,100 ns;adaptive change detection pixels;address event representation protocol;central static pixels;dynamic pixels;foveated AER imager chip;high resolution photocells;intruder detection;irradiance change detection;light intensity proportional pulse generation;low latency read-out;motion pixel read-out strategy;neurons;peripheral motion detectors,,23,,10,,,2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Assessment of Vulnerability of Content Adaptation Mechanisms to RoQ Attacks,"Guirguis, M.; Tharp, J.; Bestavros, A.; Matta, I.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Texas State Univ., San Marocs, TX","Networks, 2009. ICN '09. Eighth International Conference on",20090526,2009,,,445,450,"Current computing systems employ different mechanisms to deal with overload conditions. Of those widely deployed are content adaptation mechanisms whereby the quality level of the content is adapted dynamically to mitigate overload conditions. Serving degraded content reduces strain on resources and enables them to cater for a larger set of clients. To that end, this paper studies adversarial exploits of dynamic content adaptation mechanisms to a new instantiation of reduction of quality (RoQ) attacks. The RoQ attack pattern is orchestrated to cause different forms of damage such as longer response time for legitimate clients, degraded content being served and underutilization of resources. We assess the impact of RoQ attacks via the potency metric which reflects the tradeoffs between the damage inflicted and the cost in mounting the attack. We validate our results through numerical analysis as well as real Internet experiments.",,978-1-4244-3470-1,978-0-7695-3552-4,10.1109/ICN.2009.40,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976714,Content Adaptation;Security;Server Overload,Capacitive sensors;Computer networks;Computer science;Costs;Degradation;Delay;Internet;Numerical analysis;Waste materials;Web server,content management;resource allocation;security of data,RoQ attack pattern;RoQ attacks;computing systems;dynamic content adaptation;numerical analysis;potency metric,,1,,21,,,1-6 March 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

(PSCC), New York, NY","Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition, 2008. T&D. IEEE/PES",20080512,2008,,,1,4,"Power systems operations are increasingly reliant on information infrastructures, including communication networks, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), and self-defining communication protocols. Therefore, management of the information infrastructure is crucial to providing the necessary high levels of security and reliability in power system operations. The IEC TC57 WG15 is developing abstract Network and System Management (NSM) data objects for the power system operational environment, which can be translated to IEC 61850, SNMP, Web Services, or other protocols. These NSM data objects reflect what information is needed to manage the information infrastructure as reliably as the power system infrastructure is managed.",,978-1-4244-1903-6,978-1-4244-1904-3,10.1109/TDC.2008.4517189,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517189,IEC;communications;information management;network management;power system operations;security;system management,Communication networks;Communication system operations and management;Energy management;IEC standards;Information management;Power system management;Power system reliability;Power system security;Protocols;Technology management,IEC standards;power systems;telecommunication network management;telecommunication standards,IEC 62351-7;communication networks;information management technologies;intelligent electronic devices;network management;power system operations;self-defining communication protocols;system management,,0,,,,,21-24 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
