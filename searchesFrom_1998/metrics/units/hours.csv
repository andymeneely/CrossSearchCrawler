Even the script kiddies can initiate a sophisticated attack with just a basic knowledge on network and software technology. To overcome this matter, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used as a vital instrument in defending the network from this malicious activity. With the ability to analyze network traffic and recognize incoming and on-going network attack, majority of network administrator has turn to IDS to help them in detecting anomalies in network traffic. The gathering of information and analysis on the anomalies activity can be classified into fast and slow attack. Since fast attack activity make a connection in few second and uses a large amount of packet, detecting this early connection provide the administrator one step ahead in deflecting further damages towards the network infrastructure. This paper describes IDS that detects fast attack intrusion using time based detection method.

Therefore in this paper, we proposes a novel kind of incremental kernel principal component analysis algorithm: Data characteristic extraction based on IPCA algorithm-DCEIPCA, which allows efficient processing of large datasets and overcome the insufficient of KPCA.

A new vision for intrusion detection system in information systems,"Lounis, O.; Malika, B.","Ind. & Comput. networks Lab. LRIIR, Univ. of Oran 1, Oran, Algeria","Science and Information Conference (SAI), 2015",20150903,2015,,,1352,1356,"In recent years, information systems have seen an amazing increase in attacks. Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise. To do so, we will take the language which is realized by Jonathan Rouzauld Cornabas to modelize the system's entities to protect.

This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module.

However, there are some challenges associated with the idea of collaborative detection, such as scalability and avoidance of a central point of failure.

COMPSAC '09. 33rd Annual IEEE International",20090922,2009,1,,392,399,"The wide spread of worms poses serious challenges to today's Internet.Various IDSes (intrusion detection systems) have been proposed to identify or prevent such spread. These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance.

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category.

Different from the general server, once the cloud environment suffered from malicious attacks, people or companies will get caught in extreme dangers. Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix.

Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem.

In this paper, we present Fates, an anomaly-based NIDS designed to alleviate the two challenges. Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network. Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination. The resulting charge is applied to the individual hosts' threat assessment, providing pinpointed analysis of anomalous activities. We use various datasets to validate Fates's ability to distinguish scanning behavior from benign traffic in real time.",1095-2055,978-1-4244-1251-8,978-1-4244-1251-8,10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317884,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317884,Anomaly-based Detection;Network-based Intrusion Detection System,Computer science;Entropy;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Real time systems;Signal detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,computer network management;real-time systems;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Fates real-time anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;network host monitoring;network traffic;real-time anomaly detection,,0,,25,,,13-16 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

Suricata includes multi-threading to improve processing speed beyond Snort. Previous work comparing the two products has not used a real-world setting. We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its  backbone in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed.

The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-2324-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181,,Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server,SRAM chips;security of data,SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint,,0,,12,,,Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low.

We addresses the core competencies required to be a security conscious network manager and give some examples of things that improves our organization's current security profile. Our opinion is that an administrator cannot secure what he doesn't understand. The reality of this is that without a deep understanding of core areas of computing we have no chance of defending a network. Computer and network attacks are the product of an attacker's understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in operating systems, features of popular software, networking protocols, and programming languages. These four areas of computing are referred to as the core competencies of computing. An attacker with this skill set will be able to use his understanding of these fundamentals to turn common computing tasks or common misconfigurations against us(that is hacking). Network managers are often unwilling to implement measures that could improve their security for the following reasons: 1) they think it's too expensive. 2) they think it'd be too much work, and not enough benefits. 3) they don't think they 'll ever be attacked. 4) they don't know common security measures and recommended practices.

Smart meters have not only allowed for efficient management of many end-users, but also have made AMI an attractive target for remote exploits and local physical tampering with the end goal of stealing energy. While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior. Our experimental results on normal and anomalous load profiles show that AMIDS can identify energy theft efforts with high accuracy. Furthermore, AMIDS correctly identified legitimate load profile changes that more elementary analyses classified as malicious.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2013.130714,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547839,Power grid critical infrastructures;advanced metering infrastructures;intrusion alert correlation;intrusion and energy theft detection;multi-sensor inference and information fusion,,computerised instrumentation;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids,AMI intrusion detection system;AMIDS;advanced metering infrastructures;analog devices;computerized smart meters;data sources;elementary analyses;end-users management;information fusion;multisensor energy theft detection framework;smart grid,,3,,33,,,Jul-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

At present the presence of such a potential threat agitates a greater and greater interest in various possibilities for enhancing its security. Currently exerted defence system based on the use of firewall, antivirus software and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) represents a necessary minimum. This traditional approach to security of computer systems is primarily oriented to the defence against already existing threats. It is essential to adapt the security system to this trend as the current threats have much more aggressive forms. The use of decoy based security technology - Honeypot - represents an adequate form of defence. However, even this technology is not a security panacea as its 100% functionality is proportionally dependent on the specific installation process. This article is focused on the technology called Honeypot and the issue of implementation process of its autonomous version, which is able to create virtual Honeypots and thus rapidly increase a security level of distributed heterogeneous computer systems.

Two-tier data-driven intrusion detection for automatic generation control in smart grid,"Ali, M.Q.; Yousefian, R.; Al-Shaer, E.; Kamalasadan, S.; Quanyan Zhu","Dept. of Software & Inf.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients.

Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999).

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources.

SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,678,684,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior.

IDGraphs: intrusion detection and analysis using histographs,"Pin Ren; Yan Gao; Zhichun Li; Yan Chen; Watson, B.",,"Visualization for Computer Security, 2005. (VizSEC 05). IEEE Workshop on",20051114,2005,,,39,46,"Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for: 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies; 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns; 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the histographs (Pin Ren and Watson, 2005) technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB.

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging.

We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests.

For attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), efficiently identifying the botnet in time can be a challenge. Recently, the unsupervised learning methods such as the K-means, self-organizing map (SOM), and growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection. However, there is no study focusing on mining IP flows with high variability of attacks in an intuitive way. In this study, we leverage the visualization specialty of GHSOM to help analyze the static IP flow data, also called the network traces of victims, to identify any suspicious IP source. The GHSOM can generate a hierarchical architecture based on the input data and help reveal their inherent hierarchical relationships. For example, the geometric distances between each attack pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space which forms the signature of a botnet. The IP flows clustered by GHSOM are grouped with distinctive connecting features, and the differences between each cluster are visualized with sequential time stamps which can be used to portray various attack patterns, help explore the sources of attacks and understand the behaviors of attacks.

These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.",,0-7695-1874-5,,10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909,,Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance,Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models,Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets,,15,,30,,,6-9 Jan. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load hot-spot, which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS.

Algorithms for detecting intrusions are under rapid development, but far from being mature. One interesting and difficult issue is how to study and test a new intrusion detection algorithm against a variety of (perhaps simulated) intrusive activities under realistic background traffic. A flexible and general-purpose platform for testing intrusion detection algorithms is clearly desirable. This paper presents such a software platform, called IntruDetector. With this platform, detection algorithms can be tested directly in a real environment with a wide range of intrusive activities. The data of normal system activities are directly collected from the live environment, and are mixed with intrusive activities that are simulated by hybrid simulation.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC",20050606,2004,,,265,271,"A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.",,0-7803-8572-1,,10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826,,Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement,computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering,,0,,8,,,10-11 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

However for a developer or team working on any network project who need to perform DPI, there is always the issue of using a third party source which may involve added cost or implementing it themselves which requires time and study of protocols, signatures and the nuances of pattern matching. The paper proposes a solution to the above problem using an adaptive grammar generation algorithm. This method reduces the entropy among similar results given by different patterns. Immense customizability is the foremost advantage of this method. Existing grammars for new signatures can be combined into a single grammar easily rather than new grammars be generated from raw target strings.

The user behavior parameters are used to generate templates, which can be further customized.

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system. The experimental results demonstrate a high detection rate of 97.4% and a very low false positive rate of 2.5%.

For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed.

A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0430, Email: damon.mccoy@cs.colorado.edu","Networking Technologies for Software Define Radio Networks, 2007 2nd IEEE Workshop on",20071015,2007,,,48,54,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices.

Harnessing the Power of P2P Systems for Fast Attack Signature Validation,"Antonatos, S.; Vu Quang Hieu","Inst. of Comput. Sci., Found. for Res. & Technol.

Third International Conference on",20091110,2009,,,107,114,"Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.",,978-1-4244-5087-9,978-0-7695-3838-9,10.1109/NSS.2009.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955,P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation,Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing,P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm,,0,,14,,,19-21 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A high throughput string matching architecture for intrusion detection and prevention,"Lin Tan; Sherwood, T.","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings. 32nd International Symposium on",20050620,2005,,,112,122,"Network intrusion detection and prevention systems have emerged as one of the most effective ways of providing security to those connected to the network, and at the heart of almost every modern intrusion detection system is a string matching algorithm. String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule. Through the careful co-design and optimization of our architecture with a new string matching algorithm we show that it is possible to build a system that is 10 times more efficient than the currently best known approaches.",1063-6897,0-7695-2270-X,,10.1109/ISCA.2005.5,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431550,,Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Databases;Heart;Intrusion detection;Network-on-a-chip;Protection;Throughput,computer architecture;optimisation;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security,network chips;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;network security;network speed;string matching architecture;wireless device,,16,30,31,,,4-8 June 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This may be the reason why Physical Security does not have extended experience on how to measure its performance. Notwithstanding, Managing Security, Information Technology, Customs Relations, Production, or any other function of a company or organization should be measured. Obviously what it is not measured cannot be evaluated. And if you cannot evaluate a function of a company, how do you know if their leaders are doing well? How do you know if you are providing appropriate resources or not? In this paper we analyze which Security aspects can be measured and how. Several sets of parameters are proposed to be considered, in order to analyze the Security resources of an Organization: Effectiveness (incidents and the success of his rejection); Efficiency (money, people, work hours); Performance (equipment breakdowns attendance times, officers absenteeism, etc.); Evolution of the threats addressed (incidents and attempts); Maturity of the resources (projects planned, implemented, on operation, audited).

In order to demonstrate these detection differences, a novel framework for evaluating network security performance (the Threat-Victim Table) is developed. This framework is applied to a range of WLAN topographies using an open source (Kismet) Wireless Intrusion Detection System. Three Kismet components are utilised; client, server and drone, to represent typical IDS deployment configurations for these topographies.

The first detection electronics and set-ups were designed for indoor use (jewellery shops, museums, etc..) but in 1964 the first capacitive detectors for outdoor use i.e. perimeter security systems appeared on the market with very poor performance results. During the 1970's and 80's and sometimes over very long periods, several world wide electronic companies tried to create good working solutions using simple and inexpensive hardware for outdoor use. Sometimes excellent ideas were integrated in the electronic design but generally any investment in a innovative hardware design such as (Insulators, wiring, etc...) were poorly supported. In 1982 Siemens AG was the first company in this market which analysed all outdoor influences and who recognised the essential problems which cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector suffering from high unwanted false alarm rates. This was even if the newest sophisticated digital electronics and algorithms were used. The result was that already in 1984 a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created and patented by Siemens AG which remains state of the art even now and which is making capacitive detectors work under most of all environmental conditions. Nevertheless even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects. These effects change the field, periodically generating very high false alarm rates which are extremely difficult to detect and to measure. The reason is that the false alarm rate is specific to a site and as such is difficult to identify. It is a fact that even well trained system engineers have difficulty in solving such problems. This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a coincidental combination of seaside conditions and a local desert wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive i.e. electrostatic field detector and where trivial (but expensive) measures needed to be taken to finally solve the problem",,0-7803-5965-8,,10.1109/CCST.2000.891181,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891181,,Capacitance measurement;Consumer electronics;Detectors;Electrostatics;Hardware;Insulation;Intrusion detection;Investments;Security;Wiring,electric fields;safety systems,electrostatic field detector;intrusion detection;local desert wind;perimeter security systems;seaside conditions,,1,,4,,,2000,23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism.

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society",20030923,2003,,,53,59,"We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a <sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %.

Also, the FBG can be used as an in-ground pressure switch for intrusion detection through temporary flooring materials, such as tiles and wooden laminate.

Cyber-attack processes exhibit long range dependence and in order to investigate such properties a new class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average (GARMA) can be used.

They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks.

How dynamic is the ISPs address space?

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.",,,,10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335,,IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement,IP networks;Internet;invasive software,DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric,,0,,34,,,20-22 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability.

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service.

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting.

And if we consider a huge system in terms of users, services and accesses, the difficulty of the analysis task rises enormously. In infra-structures where there is more than one server and communication link, it is possible for the administrator and security team to configure all systems to record their logs in a central huge repository, but the search for abnormalities is quite impossible without specialized tools.

Some highlights include: (1) geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families, (2) from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families, (3) there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn.

Third IEEE International Workshop on",20050404,2005,,,85,94,"This paper presents an anomaly detection approach for application in Meta IDS environments, where locally generated event messages from several domains are centrally processed. The basic approach has been successfully used for detection of abnormal traffic structures in computer networks. It creates directed graphs from address specifications contained within event messages and generates clusterings of the graphs. Large differences between subsequent clusterings indicate anomalies. This anomaly detection approach is part of an intrusion warning system (IWS) for dynamic coalition environments.

These digital documents are the most important asset of an organization and are hence the chief target of insider abuse. Security policies provide the first step to prevent abuse by defining proper and improper usage of resources. Coarse grained security policies that operate on the principle of least privilege [J. H. Saltzer et al., (1974)] alone are not enough to address the insider threat, since the typical insider possesses a wide range of privileges to start with. In this paper, we propose a security policy that is tailored to prevent insider abuse. We define the concept of subject, object, actions, rights, context and information flow as applicable to the document control domain. Access is allowed based on the principles of least privilege and minimum requirements, subject to certain constraints. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed policy engine considers, among other factors, the context of a document request and the information flow between such requests to identify potential malicious insiders. Enforcing these fine-grained access control policies gives us a better platform to prevent the insider abuse.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

Attackers can bypass Internet-related defenses through access to unauthorized and poorly secured modems. The Internet itself, and an enterprise's Internet security policies and procedures, has made this issue worse by forcing addicted users to access the Internet through their Internet Service Provider (ISP). A typical enterprise, even one with modem usage policies and procedures, will have some number of unauthorized and/or poorly secured modems. Traditional techniques do not address this issue. Scanning and modem protection technologies assist in enforcement, but do not solve the problem. The ideal solution lies in applying concepts from the IP security network to the voice network. By deploying in-line security devices on all voice network trunk circuits, applications such as firewalls, integrated scanning, authentication, virtual private networks (VPNs), and intrusion detection can be applied. This approach provides the same level of protection and a familiar paradigm on the voice network, as is present on the IP network.

Several such metrics have been proposed, but their quality has not been studied. This paper presents a statistical analysis of how 18 security estimation metrics based on CVSS data correlate with the time-to-compromise of 34 successful attacks. The empirical data originates from an international cyber defense exercise involving over 100 participants and were collected by studying network traffic logs, attacker logs, observer logs, and network vulnerabilities. The results suggest that security modeling with CVSS data alone does not accurately portray the time-to-compromise of a system. However, results also show that metrics employing more CVSS data are more correlated with time-to-compromise.

Penetration testing: a duet,"Geer, D.; Harthorne, J.",,"Computer Security Applications Conference, 2002.

The most penetration testing can hope for is to be the science of insecurity - not the science of security nasmuch as penetration testing can at most prove insecurity by falsifying the hypothesis that any system, network, or application is secure. To be a science of security would require falsifiable hypotheses that any given system, network, or application was insecure, something that could only be done if the number of potential insecurities were known and enumerated such that the penetration tester could thereby falsify (test) a known-to-be-complete list of vulnerabilities claimed to not be present. Because the list of potential insecurities is unknowable and hence unenumerable, no penetration tester can prove security, just as no doctor can prove that you are without occult disease. Putting it as Picasso did, Art is a lie that shows the truth and security by penetration testing is a lie in that on a good day can show the truth. These incompleteness and proof-by-demonstration characteristics of penetration testing ensure that it remains an art so long as high rates of technical advance remains brisk and hence enumeration of vulnerabilities an impossibility.

Sci., Virginia Tech, Falls Church, VA, USA","Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions on",20120601,2012,9,2,169,183,"We propose a highly scalable cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to effectively deal with selfish or malicious nodes. Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ground truth node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives.

In this paper we introduce FloTracker that is an online log-free host-based root-cause analysis detection engine, with instantaneous forensics capabilities. FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point.

ENTVis: A Visual Analytic Tool for Entropy-Based Network Traffic Anomaly Detection,"Zhou, Fangfang; Huang, Wei; Zhao, Ying; Shi, Yang; Liang, Xing; Fan, Xiaoping","Central South University, China","Computer Graphics and Applications, IEEE",20151118,2015,35,6,42,50,"Entropy-based traffic metrics have received substantial attention in network traffic anomaly detection because entropy can provide fine-grained metrics of traffic distribution characteristics. However, some practical issues--such as ambiguity, lack of detailed distribution information, and a large number of false positives--affect the application of entropy-based traffic anomaly detection. In this work, we introduce a visual analytic tool called ENTVis to help users understand entropy-based traffic metrics and achieve accurate traffic anomaly detection. ENTVis provides three coordinated views and rich interactions to support a coherent visual analysis on multiple perspectives: the timeline group view for perceiving situations and finding hints of anomalies, the Radviz view for clustering similar anomalies in a period, and the matrix view for understanding traffic distributions and diagnosing anomalies in detail.

However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.",,978-1-4244-1588-5,978-1-4244-1588-5,10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847,,Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic,invasive software;telecommunication security,attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature,,12,,40,,,16-19 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols.

The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures.

Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection,Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou,"Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat. Central Univ., Jungli, Taiwan","World Telecommunications Congress (WTC), 2012",20120315,2012,,,1,6,"Accompanied by the invention of information and communication of technologies, e-government has become a prominent feature of modern governance in every country. The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.",,978-1-4577-1459-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432,,Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training,Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing,CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs,,1,,18,,,5-6 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.",,978-1-4244-1432-1,978-1-4244-1433-8,10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468,,Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN,,,,9,,16,,,10-14 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A number of computerized systems-including ATM networks, web servers, and intrusion detection systems-systematically track every atomic action we perform, thus generating massive streams of timestamped observation data, possibly from multiple concurrent activities. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently detecting occurrences of high-level activities from such interleaved data streams. A solution to this important problem would greatly benefit a broad range of applications, including fraud detection, video surveillance, and cyber security. There has been extensive work in the last few years on modeling activities using probabilistic models. In this paper, we propose a temporal probabilistic graph so that the elapsed time between observations also plays a role in defining whether a sequence of observations constitutes an activity. We first propose a data structure called temporal multiactivity graph to store multiple activities that need to be concurrently monitored. We then define an index called Temporal Multiactivity Graph Index Creation (tMAGIC) that, based on this data structure, examines and links observations as they occur. We define algorithms for insertion and bulk insertion into the tMAGIC index and show that this can be efficiently accomplished. We also define algorithms to solve two problems: the evidence problem that tries to find all occurrences of an activity (with probability over a threshold) within a given sequence of observations, and the identification problem that tries to find the activity that best matches a sequence of observations. We introduce complexity reducing restrictions and pruning strategies to make the problem-which is intrinsically exponential-linear to the number of observations.

This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic. We show that scene change analysis can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies.

Redundancy Management of Multipath Routing for Intrusion Tolerance in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Al-Hamadi, H.; Ing-Ray Chen","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Virginia Tech, Falls Church, VA, USA","Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions on",20130603,2013,10,2,189,203,"In this paper we propose redundancy management of heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSNs), utilizing multipath routing to answer user queries in the presence of unreliable and malicious nodes. The key concept of our redundancy management is to exploit the tradeoff between energy consumption vs. the gain in reliability, timeliness, and security to maximize the system useful lifetime. We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.",1932-4537,,,10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999,Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security,Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management,energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm,,4,,40,,5/13/2013,Jun-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

While the recent push for a Smart Grid has shown promise for increased efficiency, security has often been an after-thought, leaving this critical infrastructure vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, devices crucial to the safe operation of the power grid are left in remote substations with their configuration interfaces completely open, providing a vector for outsiders as well as insiders to launch an attack. This paper develops the framework for an overlay network of gateway devices that provide authenticated access control and security monitoring for these vulnerable interfaces. We develop a working prototype of such a device and simulate the performance of deployment throughout a substation. Our results suggest that such a system can be deployed with negligible impact on normal operations, while providing important security mechanisms.

Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection,Jiang Ming; Haibin Zhang; Debin Gao,"Coll. of Inf. Sci. & Technol., Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","Network and System Security (NSS), 2011 5th International Conference on",20111027,2011,,,25,32,"Anomaly detection has been attracting interests from researchers due to its advantage of being able to detect zero-day exploits. A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable.

Unfortunately, system administrators neither can keep up with the pace that an IDS is delivering alerts, nor can they react upon these within adequate time limits. Automatic response systems have to take over that task. In case of an identified intrusion, these components have to initiate appropriate actions to counter emerging threats. Most current intrusion response systems (IRSs) utilize static mappings to determine adequate response actions in reaction to detected intrusions. The problem with this approach is its inherent inflexibility. Countermeasures (such as changes of firewall rules) often do not only defend against the detected attack but may also have negative effects on legitimate users of the network and its services. To prevent a situation where a response action causes more damage that the actual attack, a mechanism is needed that compares the severity of an attack to the effects of a possible response mechanism. In this paper, we present a network model and an algorithm to evaluate the impact of response actions on the entities of a network.

However, flow monitoring is, by design, susceptible to anomalies that generate a large number of flows, such as Distributed Denial-Of-Service attacks. This paper aims at getting a better understanding on how a flow monitoring application reacts to the presence of massive attacks. We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments. We conclude that the observed changes in the flow data might cause unwanted effects in monitoring applications.

Internet Unite-and-Conquer architecture,"Karimi, K.; Hauser, C.",,"Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST), 2013 8th International Conference for",20140303,2013,,,219,230,"This paper presents UnC (Unite and Conquer), a network architecture for the Internet that provides a self-certifying mechanism to reliably distribute, retrieve, and authenticate the public keys across the Internet. UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems. This paper describes the UnC architecture in detail, including the actions of each different kind of participant. It describes how UnC deals with well-known attack models, which are readily available on the Internet.The major contribution of this work is to open up a new door for the research community to exploit the predominance of good nodes over malicious ones in order to enhance the security of the PKI ecosystem and the Internet.",,,,10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750195,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750195,Internet architecture;PKI infrastructure;geographic clusters;notary nodes;security;self-certifying addresses,Artificial neural networks;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Public key;Publishing,Internet;public key cryptography,DNSSEC protocols;Internet unite-and-conquer architecture;PKI model;S-BGP protocol;UnC architecture;public key infrastructure ecosystem;secure BGP protocol;secure DNS protocols;self-certifying mechanism,,0,,41,,,9-12 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Unveiling flat traffic on the Internet: An SSH attack case study,"Jonker, M.; Hofstede, R.; Sperotto, A.; Pras, A.","Centre for Telematics & Inf. Technol.

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.",,,,10.1109/INM.2015.7140301,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301,,Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes,Internet;computer network security;security of data,IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks,,0,,14,,,11-15 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application.

The main challenge in realizing this service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside adversaries.

The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction.

To detect anomalous behavior, we generate fuzzy association rules from new audit data and compute the similarity with sets mined from normal data.

Thanks to the advances in smart phones and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies, e-invoices can be delivered via NFC-enabled smartpones, allowing consumers to examine the content immediately after transactions and to easily retrieve them later on. Still, an extra security mechanism is needed to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of the content, as invoices may bear some value and thus become the target of a security attack.

Impact of Sanitized Message Flows in a Cooperative Intrusion Warning System,"Tolle, J.; Jahnke, M.; Felde, N.G.; Martini, P.","Res. Establ. for Appl. Sci., Wachtberg","Military Communications Conference, 2006. MILCOM 2006. IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,7,"This paper discusses the side effects of sanitizing IT security event messages in a cooperative multi-domain intrusion warning system (IWS). To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow",,1-4244-0617-X,1-4244-0618-8,10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733,,Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology,Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security,IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities,,1,1,17,,,23-25 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406,amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network,Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services,,,,4,,,,,Feb. 2013,,TUP,TUP Journals & Magazines

We first study five data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new metric, referred to as the non-uniformity factor, which quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the Renyi information entropy and better characterizes the non-uniformity of a distribution than the Shannon entropy. We then analytically and empirically measure the infection rate and the propagation speed of network-aware worms. We show that a representative network-aware worm can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a non-uniformity factor when compared to a random-scanning worm at the early stage of worm propagation. This implies that when a worm exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a network-wide vulnerability, the Internet can be infected much more rapidly. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network-aware worms.

"We are all treated equal, aren't we?  Flow-level performance as a function of flow size","Mehmood, M.A.; Feldmann, A.; Uhlig, S.; Willinger, W.","KICS, UET, Lahore, Pakistan","Networking Conference, 2014 IFIP",20140717,2014,,,1,9,"Recent Internet studies have reported on continued traffic growth, changes in applications usage, and a proliferation in the adoption of high-speed access links. Any adverse impact that these observed trends may have on Internet traffic flows can result in sub par performance, which in turn results in unsatisfactory user experience. To study such adverse impacts, we examine in this paper the flow-level performance of popular applications across a range of size-based flow-classes and applications. We use out-of-sequence packets, retransmissions, throughput, and RTTs as key flow performance metrics. Leveraging data sets collected from two complementary network environments, we compare these metrics for popular applications and for the up/downstream directions. We show that irrespective of the direction, flows are severely impacted by the specifics of the network, e.g., DSL or CDN and application behavior. We also find that, in general, this impact differs markedly across the different flow-classes. In particular, contrary to popular belief, the small flows from all applications, which make up the majority of flows, experience significant retransmissions, while the very large flows, although small in number, experience very limited retransmissions. In terms of application-related performance, we observe that especially when compared to HTTP, apart from large flows, P2P flows suffer from continuously high retransmissions and low throughput. As for the root cause of these retransmissions, we identify the access part of the network as the main culprit and not the network core.",,,,10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2014.6857100,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857100,,DSL;Internet;Measurement;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Throughput,Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic,CDN;DSL;Internet traffic flows;P2P flows;RTT;application behavior;application-related performance;flow-level performance;high-speed access links;key flow performance metrics;out-of-sequence packets;retransmissions;size-based flow-classes;throughput,,0,,45,,,2-4 June 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This sketch is used to reduce the required memory, while monitoring the traffic, by maintaining them into a predefined fixed size of hash tables. This sketch is also used to develop a probabilistic model. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used for detecting deviations between previously established and current distributions of network traffic.

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method.

Using parallel distributed reasoning for monitoring computing networks,"Musman, S.","MITRE Corp., McLean, VA, USA","MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2010 - MILCOM 2010",20110106,2010,,,417,422,"We describe a distributed reasoning system called Otto-Mate that is used to detect, reason about, and respond to incidents on a computing network. Events for monitoring computing networks occur at different system levels. Some information might relate to data, some might be operating system specific, some application or service related, some could be network related, and from each there will be compound events that describe incident effects and information about the situation context. All together there can be thousands of events per second. Today's approaches to monitoring networks are typically centralized, sending events over the network to a single engine for analysis. Centralized monitoring ultimately cannot scale to address the volume of events that one would ideally like to be able to monitor, so techniques of today often make severe compromises relating to the events that they ingest. Centralized monitoring creates a single point of failure and also generates significant network load. To overcome these deficiencies we have developed a more distributed, approach: our reasoner agents can (in theory) be installed on every monitored resources and the reasoner language (used for programming the reasoners) enables knowledge in a reasoner's working memory to be synchronized over multiple reasoners enabling them to implement parallel distributed reasoning algorithms that are able detect event patterns irrespective of whether the events are local or remote. Distributing the reasoning makes the system extremely resilient. Additionally, since the knowledge shared between the reasoning agents represents summary information, and because many on-line event correlation algorithms often suppress reporting once an incident has been reported, the amount of network load needed to support the distributed monitoring can actually be reduced. To demonstrate our approach we describe its application to the monitoring of a computing network that has been instrumented to protect it - - against 0-day email virus attacks.",2155-7578,978-1-4244-8178-1,,10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680347,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680347,autonomic response;distributed reasoning;event correlation;intelligent agents;network and security monitoring;parallel programs,Cognition;Correlation;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers;Viruses (medical),computer network security;computer viruses;electronic mail;inference mechanisms;parallel processing,Otto-Mate;computing networks;email virus attacks;operating system;parallel distributed reasoning algorithms;parallel distributed reasoning system;reasoner language;reasoning agents,,0,,11,,,Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.",,1-4244-1500-4,1-4244-1500-4,10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619,,Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server,Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management,,0,,14,,,13-15 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases.

Improving network management with software defined networking,"Hyojoon Kim; Feamster, N.",,"Communications Magazine, IEEE",20130214,2013,51,2,114,119,"Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems.

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.",1949-3053,,,10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478,Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation,Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations,distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations,DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation,,0,,43,,11/10/2014,Mar-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here.

The cyber attacks are able to impact the reliability of the power system through the SCADA system. In this paper, six cyber attack scenarios in the SCADA system are considered. A Bayesian attack graph model is used to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks on the SCADA system, which will result in breaker trips. A forced outage rate (FOR) model is proposed considering the frequencies of successful attacks on the generators and transmission lines.

Majority of these failures occur because of the unforeseen faults that manifest themselves during the execution of the software. The contemporary trends in the software industry indicate dedicated efforts to minimize these unforeseen faults, thereby minimizing the chances of unforeseen failures. One of the definitive ways is to analyze the specifications thoroughly for the potential faults it may contain. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is one such approach that scans the specifications to identify potential failure modes and has been used successfully in many domains including software. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate test cases from UML activity diagram specifications by first transforming an activity diagram into a Software Success Tree (SST) and a Software Fault Tree (SFT).

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358857,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902777,Network traffic analysis;network traffic identification;protocol reverse engineering;unsupervised information extraction,Algorithm design and analysis;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols;Redundancy,Internet;computer network management;protocols;unsupervised learning,ProWord approach;application protocols;common string;deep packet analysis rules;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram;network management system;network measurement system;network security system;ranking algorithm;traffic payload;unsupervised protocol feature word extraction;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting experts algorithm,,0,,44,,9/18/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams,"Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on",20100524,2010,,,1,8,"In this work we consider the problem of monitoring information streams for anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.",,978-1-4244-6533-0,,10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852,,Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks,entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN,IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic,,5,,22,,,19-23 April 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots.

Attack-Tolerant Time-Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Xin Hu; Taejoon Park; Shin, K.G.","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Achieving secure time-synchronization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a challenging, but very important problem that has not yet been addressed effectively. This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-2025-4,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612,,Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network,,9,,26,,,13-18 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time.

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead.

CRADS: Integrated Cross Layer Approach for Detecting Routing Attacks in MANETs,"Joseph, J.F.C.; Das, A.; Boon-Chong Seet; Bu-Sung Lee","Nanyang Technol. Univ., Nanyang","Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2008. WCNC 2008. IEEE",20080415,2008,,,1525,1530,"In ad hoc networks, the vulnerability of nodes to routing attacks is a serious concern. In this work we propose a cross-layer based routing attack detection system for ad hoc networks. Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.",1525-3511,978-1-4244-1997-5,,10.1109/WCNC.2008.273,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304,,Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines,ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security,CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine,,5,,14,,,March 31 2008-April 3 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Building a net-centric DoD teleport,"Wilson, J.; Moyles, M.M.; Miller, S.; Leonard, W.; Meyer, D.; Pitts, C.",,"Military Communications Conference, 2005. MILCOM 2005. IEEE",20060320,2005,,,3263,3268 Vol. 5,"The current Department of Defense (DoD) satellite communications architecture relies heavily on point-to-point, circuit-based communications technology, which is an inherently inefficient use of bandwidth resources. The current Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Operations Iraqi (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) demand a more efficient and scalable infrastructure to support warfighter transformation. To meet these emerging requirements, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) DoD teleport program office (TPO) is building an initial transformational net-centric architecture by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 with significant upgrades starling in FY 2006. The DoD teleport system provides the deployed warfighter access to the global information grid (GIG) by linking the space and ground segments through a worldwide, pre-positioned military and commercial satellite communications infrastructure. Through multiple radio frequency (RF) media (military and commercial bands), teleport provides inter-theater reach-back into the defense information systems network (DISN) and service command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems, as well as intra-theater communications support for tactical users. These interfaces enable the seamless, interoperable, and secure transport of command and control (C2), intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and mission critical information supporting warfighter global operations. The TPO net-centric teleport architecture converges all the voice, video, and data requirements into a single Internet protocol (IP)-based transport system, consisting of: satellite IP-based networking modems, a black convergence router suite, and a voice over IP (VoIP) gateway for unclassified voice. This architecture, combined with the global network operations (NetOps) construct, will enable significant bandwidth efficiencies for greater reach-hack and enhanced warfighting capabilities through dynamic bandwidth allocation req- ired for advanced capabilities such as unmanned aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As part of the Department's transformation, the teleport net-centric and circuit-based architecture will exist in parallel for some time to enable a gradual transition by the deployed warfighter. This architecture will be implemented in two phases beginning with a limited-IP design at two sites in FYO5 followed by a worldwide implementation at all DoD teleport locations.

In contrast to classifying traffic based on statistics of individual flows in previous studies, we build behavioral profiles of the target application, which describe dominant patterns of the application. Based on the behavioral profiles, a two-level matching is used in identifying new traffic. We first determine if a host participates in the application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, for each flow of the host we compare if it matches with the patterns in the profiles to determine which flows belong to this application.

While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks.

Protecting peer-to-peer network with roaming agents,"Banik, S.M.; Urey, H.","Dept. of Math. & Comput. Sci., Citadel, Charleston, SC, USA",SoutheastCon 2015,20150625,2015,,,1,6,"Peer-to-peer networks are continuously becoming more popular for sharing data and resources. However, a major drawback of this type of network is its ability to maintain security, since there is no centralized server to oversee the network. One way to remedy this problem is through the use of intelligent mobile agents. These agents will act as guards, which will essentially roam the network and periodically check on each node to ensure that it is not under attack. In our previous research, we have proposed algorithms for initial placement of agents in a given peer-to-peer network. As the agents are mobile, the next issue with agent-based security is how the agents should roam around the network to detect attacks. We want the agents to scan the entire network as quickly as possible which will minimize the detection time of attacks. If we run too many agents simultaneously to scan the network, they will consume system resources which will slow down the performance of applications running on the peer-to-peer network. In this paper we have proposed three roaming algorithms for agents. The first algorithm Heavy Scan Algorithm scans the network with minimum time by sacrificing the performance of the application. The second algorithm Light Scan Algorithm takes the maximum time to complete the scan of the entire network with less degradation of the performance of the application. The third algorithm Medium Scan Algorithm balances time to complete the scan with performance of the application. We have illustrated the proposed algorithms with an example.

Todaypsilas network traffic is so voluminous that manual inspection would be unreasonably expensive. In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer.

Research and implementation on the Anytime-Anywhere-Service System,Fang Dong; Chengqi Cheng; Shide Guo; Shuhua Song; Hui Guo; Endong Zhang; Yubo Yang,"Inst. of Remote Sensing & GIS, Peking Univ., Beijing, China","Geoinformatics, 2010 18th International Conference on",20100909,2010,,,1,5,"With the rapid development of remote sensing technologies, the amount of the remote sensing image data is increasing dramatically. However, the remote sensing image data's usage rate still remains very low. To solve this problem, we propose a new Service model: Anytime-Anywhere Service (AAService) model, under which users can get remote sensing images anytime and anywhere. Then we implemented and tested our AA-Service System based on this Service model. First of all, we introduced the framework of the AA-Service System. The AAService System includes three units: Data Center, Communication Unit, and User Unit; and provides three kinds of Services: image Service, plotting Service, and update Service. The features of the AA-Service are seamless coverage, all online Service, and efficient distribution. Secondly, we also described the three key technologies of the AA-Service System in this paper: distributing data according to the users' needs, updating remote sensing image partially and transmitting data in an efficient way. In the AA-Service System, the remote sensing image is organized by the global subdivision compression pyramid which enables the System to distribute remote sensing images of different resolution to users according to the users' requests. When the remote sensing image is changing, the System only updates the changed area rather than the whole image. This is different from other image Service models which distribute remote sensing images by scene or map sheet. In addition, this System ensures reliable and efficient data transmission by integrating three communication methods: BeiDou communication, CDMA communication and Internet communication, and using a new packet loss retransmission mechanism. Thirdly, we listed the statistics data of the System test. In the System test, we measured the Qos and consumed time of image Service, plotting Service and update Service respectively. The results show that this AA-Service System can provide the remote sen- - sing images Service anytime and anywhere in a short time and in a good Qos. By using this AA-Service System, the remote sensing image data's usage rate will be increased and users can experience more convenient remote sensing images Service in their daily life.",,978-1-4244-7301-4,,10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567681,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567681,AA-Service;Global Subdivision Compression Pyramid;Packet loss retransmission Mechanism;Partial-Image Updates;remote sensing images,Computational modeling;Data models;Databases;Image resolution;Internet;Receivers;Remote sensing,Internet;code division multiple access;data communication;geographic information systems;image processing;quality of service;remote sensing;statistical analysis,AA-Service system;AAService model;BeiDou communication;CDMA communication;Internet communication;QoS;all online service;anytime-anywhere-service system;communication unit;data center;data transmission;global subdivision compression pyramid;image service;packet loss retransmission mechanism;plotting service;remote sensing image data;remote sensing technology;seamless coverage;statistics data;update service;user unit,,0,,12,,,18-20 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Model-based fault Diagnosis for IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs,Bo Yan; Guanling Chen,"Dept. of Comput.

MobiQuitous '09. 6th Annual International",20091110,2009,,,1,10,"The increasingly deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) challenge traditional network management systems because of the shared open medium and the varying channel conditions. There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.",,978-963-9799-59-2,,10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395,,Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol,fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN,IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications,,3,,34,,,13-16 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

So it is a key mission to make sure that the pattern definition is correct, complete and up to date. In this paper, a classical data mining algorithm is used to help us discover attack patterns, construct and maintain rules. It can overcome the highly dependent on knowledge of experts, time-consuming and error-prone drawbacks in previous approaches using manual analysis. Unfortunately, for a dynamic network environment where novel attack strategies appear continuously, the method shows a limited capability to detect the novel attack patterns.

Characterising the Evolution in Scanning Activity of Suspicious Hosts,"Wahid, A.; Leckie, C.; Chenfeng Zhou","Dept. of Comput.

Third International Conference on",20091110,2009,,,344,350,"The early detection of multistage attacks like DDoS and coordinated spamming poses a major challenge for existing counter-measures based on reactive blacklists. One approach to addressing this challenge would be to profile hosts that engage in scanning activity and predict their future actions. However, this requires understanding how hosts evolve their scanning behaviour. In order to address this issue we have analysed logs from the DShield repository of globally distributed IDS alerts corresponding to the first 15 days of January 2005. We first clustered hosts using similarities in the spatial breadth (targeted DShield subscribers) and depth (targeted destination ports) of their scanning activity during aggregation intervals of one day at a time. We then analysed temporal properties like popularity, volatility, lifetime and transition of these clusters to infer how they evolved over time. We found persistent clusters with stable sizes. However, they were highly volatile with a consistent turn-over of hosts everyday. This was caused by the lifetime of hosts in each cluster mostly being one day. Nevertheless, we came across a non-trivial number of hosts that appeared everyday while belonging to the same cluster or transitioning from one cluster to another. Based on these findings, it is plausible that suspicious hosts can be profiled for long periods of time to predict an imminent multistage attack.",,978-1-4244-5087-9,978-0-7695-3838-9,10.1109/NSS.2009.13,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319276,,Aggregates;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Internet;Intrusion detection;Recruitment;Size measurement;Software engineering;Spatiotemporal phenomena,Internet;security of data;telecommunication security,DShield repository;Internet;aggregation interval;distributed IDS;evolution characterisation;imminent multistage attack detection;stable size;suspicious host scanning activity;temporal property,,0,3,13,,,19-21 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer.

Madras, Chennai, India","Local Computer Networks (LCN), 2012 IEEE 37th Conference on",20130131,2012,,,76,84,"Network traffic characterisation and modeling using time series models is an area which has been extensively studied in the past. Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.",0742-1303,978-1-4673-1565-4,,10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689,Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models,Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis,autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols,DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks,,0,,47,,,22-25 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Biologically inspired risk assessment in cyber security using neural networks,"Ionita, M.-G.; Patriciu, V.-V.","Mil. Tech. Acad., Bucharest, Romania","Communications (COMM), 2014 10th International Conference on",20140726,2014,,,1,4,"The only suitable option for risk assessment systems designed with real-time constraints in mind, in the present seems to be the one based on attack graphs. Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts.

However, they are still one of the most vulnerable parts of organizations infrastructure. Exploits are many times used by worms to fast propagate across the full Internet being Web servers one of their main targets. New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.",1060-9857,978-0-7695-3826-6,,10.1109/SRDS.2009.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421,exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware,Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server,Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security,HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit,,1,1,36,,,27-30 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic.

Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks.

Outdoor perimeter security sensors a forty year perspective,"Harman, K.; Messner, W.K.","Harman Analytics, Almonte, ON, Canada","Security Technology (ICCST), 2012 IEEE International Carnahan Conference on",20121231,2012,,,1,9,"Outdoor perimeter security sensors have played, and continue to play, an important role in the security of critical assets and VIP residents over the past 40 years. In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as Slow-Tech in a High-Tech world. In High-Tech we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the Slow-Tech world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the real world of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This mil-spec environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small spin-off one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited.

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network.

IDS Alert Correlation in the Wild With EDGe,"Raftopoulos, E.; Dimitropoulos, X.","ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20141127,2014,32,10,1933,1946,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) produce a large number of alerts, which overwhelm their operators, e.g., a deployment of the popular Snort IDS in the campus network of ETH Zurich (which includes more than 40 thousand hosts) produces on average 3 million alerts per day. In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the big-dataism. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks.

Routing through an integrated communication and social network,"Bigrigg, M.W.; Carley, K.M.; Manousakis, K.; McAuley, A.","Inst. for Software Res., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Military Communications Conference, 2009. MILCOM 2009. IEEE",20100115,2009,,,1,7,"This paper explores the robust routing of messages among individuals. Traditional routing assumes individuals provide messages to a device connected to a communications network that assumes all responsibility for message delivery. Although each individual may have links to multiple communication devices (office computer, PDA, cell phone), messages are delivered only if there is an end-to-end communication path between communication devices available to each individual. To improve robustness of communication, especially in dynamic ad hoc military networks, this paper models a novel routing paradigm using an integrated communication and social network. The understanding is that individuals can and do route messages through a social network in conjunction with the communication network. An example of this is an individual asking another in his immediate social network to place a call on his behalf when the official communication system is not convenient or is unavailable. We show that it is possible to route messages through the integrated social and communication network by: a) using the ORA social analysis tool to select normalized costs for the social and communication network links (e.g., to reflect the link delay, quality or robustness), and b) using the MONOPATI communication design tool to model the integrated socio-communication network as a graph and performing QoS routing. Results show that the robustness of message delivery can be improved by 5X through this joint routing, without unnecessary impacts on end to end latency.",,978-1-4244-5238-5,978-1-4244-5239-2,10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379848,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379848,,,ad hoc networks;electronic messaging;military communication;quality of service;telecommunication network routing,MONOPATI communication design tool;ORA social analysis tool;QoS routing;dynamic ad hoc military networks;end-to-end communication path;integrated communication;message delivery;message routing;multiple communication devices;sociocommnunication network,,2,,18,,,18-21 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces.

Within a short period, viruses multiply and spread rapidly across the networks, resulting into a digital epidemic. Because it is only a digital device that can function as a virus carrier, it must necessarily participate in the mechanism to prevent spread of viruses. To contain digital epidemics, we introduce a novel philosophy of artificial hygiene (AH) for digital devices. Hygiene is the art and science of prevention of propagation of disease.

Although billions are expended worldwide on cyber security, organizations struggle with complexity, e.g., the NISTIR 7628 guidelines for cyber-physical systems are over 600 pages of text. And there is a lack of information visibility. Organizations must bridge the gap between technical cyber operations and the business/social priorities since both sides are essential for ensuring cyber security. Identifying visual structures for information synthesis could help reduce the complexity while increasing information visibility within organizations. This paper lays the foundation for investigating such visual structures by first identifying where current visual structures are succeeding or failing. To do this, we examined publicly available analyses related to three types of security issues: 1) epidemic, 2) cyber attacks on an industrial network, and 3) threat of terrorist attack. We found that existing visual structures are largely inadequate for reducing complexity and improving information visibility. However, based on our analysis, we identified a range of different visual structures, and their possible trade-offs/limitation is framing strategies for cyber policy.

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets.

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.",,978-0-7695-3347-6,,10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314,Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis,Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes,Internet;information retrieval;security of data,Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet,,3,,33,,,21-22 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

SMARTDIAB consists mainly of two units: 1) the patient unit (PU); and 2) the patient management unit (PMU), which communicate with each other for data exchange. The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment.

Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images,"Bazi, Y.; Melgani, F.","Dept. of Inf. & Commun. Technol., Trento Univ.","Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on",20061030,2006,44,11,3374,3385,"Recent remote sensing literature has shown that support vector machine (SVM) methods generally outperform traditional statistical and neural methods in classification problems involving hyperspectral images. However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method",0196-2892,,,10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732,Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs),Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines,feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines,feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine,,91,1,46,,,Nov. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults.

This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components.

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

We improve this architecture and propose an approach that allows using a consensus algorithm executed by the probes of the Internet Service Providers in order to detect and react to massive DDoS attacks in a coordinated fashion and under Byzantine assumptions.

In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity.

This technique is not suited to find the signatures of DDoS attack, which is formless. Also, DDoS is in general the combination of different forms of denial of service (DoS). As a result, it is difficult to find the exact signature of attack. Moreover, it is very difficult to distinguish the difference between an unusual high traffic which is caused by the attack, and the flash crowds which normally occur when a huge number of users use the target machine at the same time. In fact, this difference should only be observed from analyzing the data in the packet header. In this paper, we propose to discover the DDoS attacking signature by analyzing the TCP/IP packet header against the well defined rules and conditions, and distinguish the difference between normal and abnormal traffic.

The state machine based attack scenario reconstruction technology processes security events using clustering analysis and causal analysis concurrently, it builds a correlation state machine in memory for every attack scenario tree which is predefined by the security manager, when security events are coming, the current state set of the correlation state machine will process them, if the condition is satisfied, the current states of the state machine will transfer, it corresponds to the developing of the multi-step attack. If one of the leaf nodes of the state machine is in its current state set, an attack scenario description information will be generated and then sent to the security manager.

Third International Conference on",20080523,2008,,,204,211,"This paper introduces a novel system (architecture and techniques) that aims to secure overlay networks by detecting anomalies in Voice over IP networks. It is particularly designed for the signaling protocol SIP. The proposed system mainly consists of two parts. The first one determines the different features that are extracted from the specification of the SIP protocol. In fact, these features should highly characterize the behavior of the signaling traffic so that the evidence of the intrusion is not lost when only these attributes are considered for the attack detection goal. After the attributes extraction step, a detection algorithm is used to classify new SIP profiles in their appropriate class (either as normal, or as an anomaly).

Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-dimensional Clustering method for Short-time scale Traffic(MCST) to classify abnormal and normal traffic.

A Flow Classifier with Tamper-Resistant Features and an Evaluation of Its Portability to New Domains,"Guixi Zou; Kesidis, G.; Miller, D.J.","EE & CS & E Depts, Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20110728,2011,29,7,1449,1460,"Flow classification by application type is motivated by on-line anomaly detection, off-line network planning, and on-line enforcement of terms-of-use policies by public ISPs or by administrators of private-enterprise networks. Both signature matching and a variety of feature-based pattern recognition methods have been applied to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must port over a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain.

Different from an offline approach, which usually profile network traffic using previously captured data for a certain period of time, an online and adaptive approach can use a shorter period of data capturing and evolve its profile if the characteristics of the network traffic has changed.",,0-7803-9091-1,,10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527622,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527622,Adaptive System;Distributed Anomaly Detection;Evolvable-Neural-Based Fuzzy Inference System;Evolving Connectionist Systems,Adaptive systems;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,adaptive systems;computer networks;evolutionary computation;fuzzy reasoning;neural nets;real-time systems;security of data,anomalous traffic detection;connectionist model;distributed adaptive network anomaly detection system;evolvable-neural-based fuzzy inference system;evolving connectionist system;network diagnosis;network traffic profiling;real-time detection,,2,,10,,,18-21 Aug. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall network behavior of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system.

Learning of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Using Density Estimate,"Stach, W.; Pedrycz, W.; Kurgan, L.A.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.",1083-4419,,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163,Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs),Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors,cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence),SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms,"Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated",2,,49,,2/14/2012,Jun-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

However, there has only a few research related to similarity evaluation under data stream contexts. The main reason is because of the native feature of data streams, namely, large, continuous, and only one pass scan. It is hard to find an efficient method to evaluate similarity over data streams. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm ESDS(estimating similarity over data streams), which not only can estimate similarity efficiently over data streams under the time warping distance but is the first time to use DTW(dynamic time warping) distance based on the sliding window to deal with similarity evaluation over data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first paper to address this problem. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, we present a simple but efficiently method to denote the original stream data. In computing the distance of DTW between data streams by using dynamic programming, we also introduce a new distance of DTW which can compute the similarity over data streams efficiently. The experiments of many real and synthetic data sets show that our algorithm can evaluate the similarity over data streams efficiently and not be studied in the previous research.",,978-0-7695-2874-8,,10.1109/FSKD.2007.274,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406201,,Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer networks;Data analysis;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Electrostatic discharge;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Sun,data handling;dynamic programming;security of data;time warp simulation,data streams;dynamic programming;dynamic time warping;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor queries,,1,,18,,,24-27 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated.

Usually, the network security policy is defined as the collection of service access rules between various network zones. The specification of the security policy is often incomplete since all possible service access paths may not be explicitly covered. This policy is implemented in the network interfaces in a distributed fashion through sets of access control (ACL) rules. Formally verifying whether the distributed ACL implementation conforms to the security policy is a major requirement. The complexity of the problem is compounded as some combination of network services may lead to inconsistent hidden access paths. Further, failure of network link(s) may result in the formation of alternative routing paths and thus the existing security implementation may defy the policy. In this study, an integrated formal verification and fault analysis framework has been proposed which derives a correct ACL implementation with respect to given policy specification and also ensures that the implementation is fault tolerant to certain number of link failures. The verification incorporates boolean modelling of the security policies and ACL implementations and then formulates a satisfiability checking problem.",1751-8709,,,10.1049/iet-ifs.2009.0174,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672444,,,Boolean functions;authorisation;business communication;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;formal verification;network routing;telecommunication network topology,access control rules;alternative routing paths;boolean modelling;enterprise network;fault analysis;fault tolerant;formal approach;formal verification;hidden access paths;integrated security analysis;network interfaces;network link failure;network security policy;network topology;service access rules,,3,,,,,Dec-10,,IET,IET Journals & Magazines

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack.

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server.

Although this task is critical to the performance of the system, microprocessors perform it extremely poorly. Furthermore, the traditional network processor approaches of multicore and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the list is a shared data structure. While match processing can be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations can be extremely inflexible and lead to extremely high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable architecture for a processor to handle the matching function. The matching engine approaches the performance of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and programmability.

A host of security issues need to be addressed for such interactive grids to gain acceptance, particularly in industry. The purpose of this paper is to study these security issues. The grid security infrastructure (GSI), a component of the Globus Toolkit (I. Foster et al., 1997), creates grid credentials for every user and resource.

The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased.

The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks.

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association.

Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed. After that, Six ML algorithms AdaboostM1, C4.5, Random Forest tree, MLP, RBF and SVM with Polykernel function classifiers are used for IP traffic classification.

Recognizing that the smart objects in IoT are most likely human-carried or human-operated devices, we propose a scalable trust management protocol for IoT, with the emphasis on social relationships. We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes.

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers. Thus, we conclude that estimating the information entropy and the relevant inference risk using a pre-processor can yield a simpler and more accurate classification tree.",1082-3409,978-1-4244-5619-2,978-0-7695-3920-1,10.1109/ICTAI.2009.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362617,,Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Facebook;Information entropy;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Risk analysis;Social network services,decision trees;entropy;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;mobile computing;pattern classification;risk analysis,Web2.0 applications;classification tree analysis;data training;decision tree;information entropy;knowledge representation;large mobile phone field;location-aware application;low-entropy situations;preprocessor;social inference risk estimation method;unwanted social inference function;user privacy,,2,,29,,,2-4 Nov. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., Atak worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms. We propose different integrated schemes for fighting different self-disciplinary worms, and evaluate their performance via real-world traffic data.",1045-9219,,,10.1109/TPDS.2009.161,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313807,Worm;anomaly detection.;game theory,Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Distributed computing;Forensics;Game theory;Traffic control;Web and internet services,Internet;game theory;invasive software,Internet;detection probability;game theoretic formulation;self-disciplinary worms;worm detection schemes;worm propagation,,4,,61,,11/6/2009,Oct. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Wireless ad hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks (DoS) due to their open decentralized architecture, highly dynamic topology and shared wireless medium in which they exist. One of the primary concerns with respect to ad hoc networks is to provide secure communication among mobile nodes in a hostile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network. The presented intrusion detection scheme produces a more natural system, which is more capable of dealing with malicious or suspected nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheme improves network throughput by smartly classifying the nodes into different categories depending on their current actions and previous history.",,0-7803-9181-0,,10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512922,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512922,,Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Protection;Throughput;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security,Routeguard;communication security;denial of service attacks;dynamic topology;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;network throughput improvement;response system,,2,,20,,,22-24 Aug. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability.

By simulating attacks, the method infers possible routes of attack and identifies emergent weaknesses while accounting for adversaries' heterogeneous objectives, capabilities, and available modes of entry.

However, their security problems are ignored despite their importance and popularity. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth security analysis on GPUs to detect security vulnerabilities. We observe that contemporary, widely-used GPUs, both NVIDIA's and AMD's, do not initialize newly allocated GPU memory pages which may contain sensitive user data. By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures. The accuracy of our advanced inference attack that uses both pixel sequence matching and RGB histogram matching is up to 95.4%.",1081-6011,,,10.1109/SP.2014.9,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956554,,Browsers;Chromium;Context;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Memory management;Security,graphics processing units;image matching;image texture;rendering (computer graphics),AMD GPU;GPU memory pages;GPU vulnerability;NVIDIA GPU;RGB histogram matching;Web page;graphics processing unit;pixel sequence matching;red-green-blue histogram matching;rendering,,0,,39,,,18-21 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Unfortunately, many applications of visualization technology fall short of expectations because the technology is used inappropriately - the wrong tool applied in the wrong way. A study of visualization techniques as applied to one particularly demanding area, information assurance, leads to the conclusion that there is a proper and formal way to approach designing visualization techniques for maintaining situational awareness in complex domains. Visualization techniques should be specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three identified stages of situational awareness - perception, comprehension, or projection -and with one of five standard uses of visualization - monitoring, inspecting, exploring, forecasting, or communicating. Greater value can be realized by selecting the right visualization technique to focus on each operational task, rather than searching for a single all-encompassing solution to fit every need.

In this paper, we present a differentiated service protection framework consisting of anomaly traffic detection and resource management. Data mining based anomaly traffic detection is implemented at the host; whereas resource management is responsible for the allocation of network resources to the applications. Based on the deviation of the monitored traffic to the normal traffic, differentiated resources are allocated to the traffic. When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS. The impact of the traffic anomalies on the legitimate services can be mitigated, and the legitimate services can be protected.

Fourth International Conference on",20070416,2007,,,77,82,"Signature-based detection is the most widely used technique for intrusion detection systems (IDS). One of the major challenges for signature-based IDS is how to keep up with a large volume of incoming traffic when each packet needs to be compared with every signature in the database. When an IDS cannot keep up with the traffic flood, all it can do is to drop packets, therefore, may miss potential attacks. In this paper, we propose a dynamic model of two-layer signature-based IDS with unequal database, which can detect imminent threats with very high success rate by automatically creating and using a small efficient database, and at the same time, provide mechanisms to detect all other known threats by using a less efficient complementary database",,0-7695-2776-0,,10.1109/ITNG.2007.80,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4151663,,Computer worms;Data security;Databases;Floods;Humans;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,security of data,dynamic two-layer signature-based IDS;intrusion detection systems;signature-based detection;unequal databases,,1,,15,,,2-4 April 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper we address this issue by investigating effective solutions to automatically identify compromised machines in a network. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised.

The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour.

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.",,,,10.1109/EAIT.2014.24,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032,Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node,Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV,data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing,CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack,,0,,18,,,19-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Hyperthreats: Hypercall-based DoS attacks,"Shropshire, J.","CIS, Univ. of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA",SoutheastCon 2015,20150625,2015,,,1,7,"The cloud offers a new environment for achieving Denial of Service (DoS) conditions on targeted infrastructure. Once confined to the network, they are now conducted over the hypercall interface. These attacks are initiated by malicious, unprivileged guests with a goal of incapacitating hosting hypervisors. Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls. The assumption is that exploits will be manifested as previously-unobserved sequences of hypercalls.

Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection,"Ye, N.; Yebin Zhang; Borror, C.M.","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20040405,2004,53,1,116,123,"Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.",0018-9529,,,10.1109/TR.2004.823851,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169,,Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing,Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security,Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size,,38,1,56,,,Mar-04,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Botnets are groups of compromised computers controlled by a botmaster through a command and control (C&C) channel. They are noted as one of the foremost security threat causing large scale attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Spam, mass identity theft and click fraud. Various approaches are used to detect botnets and they range from network to host level detection. To enhance the detection rate, a correlation based model was proposed that combines both host and network level information. Such a model is valid in a network made of trusted hosts. The emergence of smartphones with the capability of mobility and being hosts in different networks, open the door of having untrusted hosts that can reveal fake information. As a solution, we propose a trust-based model that uses cooperative game theory to cluster trusted hosts. The trust is built using the reputation value and it is computed using the hosts' marginal contribution which is derived from Shapley value. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection score compared to the traditional correlation model.

In fact, using open source web applications is a double-edged sword in that it supplies both attackers and defenders more control over their security aspect. Well-known attacks are aimed access resources that are not referenced by the web application and lead to information discloser. Inspired by the idea of a sniper lurking in the shadows of civilization as a secret guard, this paper proposes a framework-named Sniper-to improve the security of open source web applications. Mimicking a real sniper who hides in the bushes to watch and eliminate dangerous enemies, the proposed Sniper framework is hidden within the web application to capture potential attackers. To illustrate further, if an attacker approaches your website seeking sensitive data, Sniper will be there watching to detect the intrusion, notify the webmaster anonymously, and block the attacker based on predefined thresholds. Therefore, Sniper identifies and mitigates attack attempts ahead of time by monitoring suspicious traffic intended to reach forbidden or sensitive areas. Sniper was implemented and tested using three different open source web applications.

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching.

Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer-using purely local observation-information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties, such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet.

Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail.

International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation X.805 suggests that availability has a specific meaning for security, namely, that it ensures that there is no denial of authorized access to network elements, stored information, information flows, services and applications due to events impacting the network. This definition is very similar to the definition of availability that reliability engineers use in describing functionality. This paper explores the similarities and differences in approaches taken within the communications domain for reliability and security. The three areas that are discussed are terminology, requirements, and common techniques.  2007 Alcatel-Lucent.",1089-7089,,,10.1002/bltj.20250,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6769676,,,,,,0,,,,,Fall 2007,,Alcatel-Lucent,Alcatel-Lucent Journal
Combating Against Attacks on Encrypted Protocols,"Fadlullah, Z.M.; Taleb, T.; Ansari, N.; Hashimoto, K.; Miyake, Y.; Nemoto, Y.; Kato, N.","Tohoku Univ., Sendai","Communications, 2007. ICC '07. IEEE International Conference on",20070813,2007,,,1211,1216,"Attacks against encrypted protocols are becoming increasingly popular. They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker. The effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme is verified via simulations.",,1-4244-0353-7,,10.1109/ICC.2007.205,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288876,,Access protocols;Authentication;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Databases;Delay;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Transport protocols,cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security,anomaly-based detection systems;attack signatures;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;nonparametric Cusum algorithm;packet network;secure socket layer;signature-based systems,,4,,15,,,24-28 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

However, these documents do not provide much guidance about recognizing potential problems or about preventative measures. Even so, it is apparent that knowingly tolerating dishonesty or incompetence within the corporation is likely to be regarded as negligence. Most organizations today pay little attention to the inter-relationship between the Formal component, Technical component and Informal component. The Board and senior management of organizations tend to focus more on narrow aspects such as ISIIT management rather than on a comprehensive view. Deficiencies in any of these three components may result in unbalanced IS/IT security implementation. The objective of this study is to integrate the three components simultaneously throughout the IS/IT security implementation.

It is difficult to prevent because DDoS attacker send spoofing packets to victim which makes the identification of the origin of attacks very difficult. A series of techniques have been studied such as pattern matching by learning the attack pattern and abnormal traffic detection. However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks.

Ever increasing online and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server.

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes.

Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers. Its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure.

International Conference on",20070808,2007,,,91,100,"In this paper a novel approach to assessing the threat of network intrusions is proposed. Unlike the present approaches which assess the attack threat either from a backward perspective (how probable a security state can be reached) or from the perspective of the attacks themselves (how much an attack would cause damage to the network), this approach assesses the attack threat from a forwarding perspective (how probable it would be the precursor of future attacks). First, to every attack type and some attack scenarios, their probabilities of having following attacks(PFAs) are calculated by a data mining algorithm. Then the threats of real time intrusions are assessed by these probabilities. The result of the threat assessment can help identify the intrusion alerts which would be the best evidence for the coming attacks from tremendous amount of intrusion alerts, thus this approach can be used for intrusion prediction. The approach is validated by DARPA 2000 and DARPA 1999 intrusion detection evaluation datasets.",,0-7695-2927-5,,10.1109/NAS.2007.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286413,,Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Floods;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network topology;Probability;Secure storage,data mining;security of data,attack threat assessment;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection,,3,,26,,,29-31 July 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations.

State-of-the-art IDS produce voluminous alerts, most false alarms, and function mainly by recognizing the signatures of known attacks so that novel attacks slip past them. Attempts have been made to create systems that recognize the signature of normal, in the hope that they will then detect attacks, known or novel. These systems are often confounded by the extreme variability of nominal behavior. The paper describes an experiment with an IDS composed of a hierarchy of neural networks (NN) that functions as a true anomaly detector. This result is achieved by monitoring selected areas of network behavior, such as protocols, that are predictable in advance. While this does not cover the entire attack space, a considerable number of attacks are carried out by violating the expectations of the protocol/operating system designer. Within this focus, the NNs are trained using data that spans the entire normal space. These detectors are able to recognize attacks that were not specifically presented during training. We show that using small detectors in a hierarchy gives a better result than a single large detector.

This knowledge is provided by network mapping tools. These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit.

Since profiling complex sequential data is still an open problem in anomaly detection, there is a need to explore new approaches. While previous research has used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for anomaly-based intrusion detection, the proposed models tend to increase rapidly in complexity in order to increase the detection rate while reducing the false detections. In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM). Our process trace clustering approach using HMMs for system call anomaly detection provides accurate results and reduces the complexity required to detect anomalies.

Security Incident Origin Discovery (SIOD): IP Transaction Tracking for Centralized Cyber Defense,"Charbonneau, N.; Newman, B.; Pecelli, D.","MITRE Corp., Bedford, MA, USA","Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,30,39,"In many enterprise Internet Protocol networks, Network Address Translation and other traffic forwarding techniques protect interior assets from exterior threats by minimizing exposure to just a single, hardened point. Complex networks may incorporate several layers of such protection. However, this obfuscation also hinders legitimate cyber security functions, discovering the complete path of a suspicious traffic flow requires inspecting forwarders' logs, unraveling one layer of concealment at a time. These challenges are compounded when centralized cyber-defense teams must pursue suspicious activity across numerous regional and individual site networks. Identifying a single host at the end of a dubious transaction may require coordination among central, regional, and local administrators, as well as human review of many intermediary devices' activity logs. In this paper, we describe an approach to automate the investigation process by correlating details of alerts and forwarder records to iteratively discover the chain of forwarders implicated in a given transaction. By rapidly revealing a suspicious transaction's true endpoints, incident response times can be dramatically reduced, allowing for rapid intervention and analysis. We present our prototype tracing algorithm in pseudo-code, describe the diverse lab environment in which it was developed, and detail specific trace scenarios for both web and Domain Name Service traffic. We address unique log formats and behaviors of different forwarders and recommend practices for specific units.

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy",,0-7803-9788-6,,10.1109/IRI.2006.252413,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490,,Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks,data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN,clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN,,1,,15,,,16-18 Sept. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Accelerating DFA Construction by Hierarchical Merging,Yanbing Liu; Li Guo; Muyi Guo; Ping Liu,,"Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications (ISPA), 2011 IEEE 9th International Symposium on",20110714,2011,,,1,6,"Regular expression matching is widely used in many network applications to analyze suspicious traffic against predefined signatures, and to discover anomalous events. Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is the basic data structure to scan input traffic byte by byte. Though DFA meets the requirement of real-time processing of network traffic, constructing a combined DFA for a set of regular expression signatures is very time-consuming, especially when the signature set is large. To attack this problem, we propose new strategies to accelerate DFA construction. The basic idea of our method is to construct the combined DFA by hierarchical merging of the DFAs of each single regular expression.

By plotting the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves induced by the traffic activity, we quantify the effectiveness of network activity models in discriminating normal connections from attack connections generated by denial-of-service and probing attacks. It is verified that denial-of-service and probing attacks leave traces on simple network activity models, with rates of false alarm which are comparable to the false alarm rates obtained by the participants of the 1998 DARPA evaluation, in which much more complex detection schemes were utilized. For application models, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show that attacks using telnet connections in the DARPA data set form a population which is statistically different from the normal telnet connections.

Computer worms and viruses exploit these social networks in order to propagate to other users. In this paper we present a new framework aimed at slowing down or even preventing the propagation of computer worms and viruses in social networks. In the first part of the framework a social network has to be derived for a given community of users. In the second part the group of users that have the highest influence on the communication in the social network has to be located. The group betweenness centrality measure is used to evaluate the influence of each candidate group. In the third part we analyze the threat propagation in the social network assuming that a distributed network intrusion detection system (DNIDS) is monitoring the traffic of the group. The analysis is performed using a network simulator that was developed for this purpose.

The proposed laboratory provides effective security training by offering practical scenarios to practice attack and defense. The scenarios are parameterized and configured automatically to improve manageability.

Systematic Signature Engineering by Re-use of Snort Signatures,"Schmerl, S.; Koenig, H.; Flegel, U.; Meier, M.; Rietz, R.","Brandenburg Univ. of Technol., Cottbus","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2008. ACSAC 2008. Annual",20081222,2008,,,23,32,Most intrusion detection systems deployed today apply the misuse detection approach. Misuse detection compares recorded audit data with predefined patterns denoted as signatures. A signature is usually empirically engineered based on experience and expert knowledge. This induces relatively long development times for novel signatures causing inappropriate long vulnerability windows. Methods for a systematic engineering have been scarcely reported so far. Approaches for an automated re-use of design and modeling decisions of available signatures also do not exist. In this paper we present an approach for systematic engineering of signatures which is based on the re-use of existing signatures. It exploits similarities with known attacks for the engineering process. The method applies an iterative abstraction of signatures. Based on a weighted assessment of the abstractions the signature engineer can select the most appropriate signatures or fragments of signatures for the development of the signature for a new attack. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method using Snort signatures as example.,1063-9527,978-0-7695-3447-3,,10.1109/ACSAC.2008.20,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721541,Attack Signatures;Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;Misuse Detection;Signature Engineering;Snort,Application software;Computer security;Counting circuits;Design engineering;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Specification languages;Systems engineering and theory,expert systems;security of data,Snort signature;intrusion detection system;iterative abstraction;misuse detection approach;systematic signature engineering,,0,,8,,,8-12 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Detection of Bot Infected PCs Using Destination-Based IP and Domain Whitelists During a Non-Operating Term,"Takemori, K.; Nishigaki, M.; Takami, T.; Miyake, Y.","KDDI R&D Labs. Inc., Fujimino","Global Telecommunications Conference, 2008. IEEE GLOBECOM 2008. IEEE",20081208,2008,,,1,6,"Spam e-mails and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have now become critical issues to the Internet. These attacks are considered to be sent from bot infected PCs. As a bot communicates with a malicious controller over an encrypted channel and updates its code frequently, it becomes difficult to detect infected personal computers (PCs) using pattern-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and antivirus systems (AVs). As sending attack and control packets from the bot process are independent of the user operation, a behavior monitor is effective to detect an anomaly communication. In this paper, we propose a bot detection technique that checks outbound packets with destination-based whitelists. If any outbound packets during the non-operating term do not match the whitelists, the PC is considered to be infected by the bot. The whitelists are a set of a destination IP address and/or domain names (DNs) that are listed by monitoring outbound packets from an un-infected PC. Because the many IPs and DNs are grouped into a few sub-networks and superior DNs, it is easier to maintain the destination-based whitelists than the pattern-based IDS/AV. We implement the proposal system as a host-based detector and evaluate false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) frequencies for detection of bot activities.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-2324-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.399,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698174,,Communication system control;Computer crime;Control systems;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Microcomputers;Personal communication networks;Unsolicited electronic mail;Web and internet services,IP networks;Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;telecommunication security;unsolicited e-mail,DDoS;Internet;anomaly communication detection;antivirus system;behavior monitor;bot infected PC detection;destination-based IP;distributed denial of service attack;domain name;domain whitelist;encrypted channel;pattern-based intrusion detection system;spam e-mail,,3,1,18,,,Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
SIDAN: A tool dedicated to software instrumentation for detecting attacks on non-control-data,"Demay, J.-C.; Totel, E.; Tronel, F.","SUPELEC, Rennes, France","Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS), 2009 Fourth International Conference on",20100217,2009,,,51,58,"Anomaly based intrusion detection systems rely on the build of a normal behavior model. When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.",2151-4763,978-1-4244-4498-4,978-1-4244-4499-1,10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977,,Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools,data handling;security of data,SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation,,1,,25,,,19-22 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A novel approach to detection of intrusions in computer networks via adaptive sequential and batch-sequential change-point detection methods,"Tartakovsky, A.G.; Rozovskii, B.L.; Blazek, R.B.; Hongjoong Kim","Dept. of Math., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on",20060821,2006,54,9,3372,3382,"Large-scale computer network attacks in their final stages can readily be identified by observing very abrupt changes in the network traffic. In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware.
