Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think,"Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.",,"Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,185,190,"A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.",,,,10.1109/SPW.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302,,Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches,Internet;finite state machines;protocols,FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications,,0,,9,,,17-18 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Third International Conference on",20091110,2009,,,107,114,"Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data.

This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts.

New directions in covert malware modeling which exploit white-listing,"Wang, J.; Kesidis, G.; Miller, D.J.","Dept. of EE&CSE, Penn State Univ., University Park, PA","Sarnoff Symposium, 2007 IEEE",20080716,2007,,,1,7,"Zero-day attacks - especially those that hide the attack exploit by using code obfuscation and encryption - remain a formidable challenge to existing network defenses. Many techniques have been developed that can address known attacks and similar new attacks that may arise in the future. Some methods, like Earlybird and Polygraph, focus on string-based content prevalence in payloads; others focus on the presence of particular I386 instructions, e.g., Sigfree counts the number of ldquousefulrdquo instructions in each request. For both types of systems, a white-listing mechanism, in which some strings or instructions are regarded as innocuous, is necessary to avoid a high false positive rate associated with common content such as URL addresses and peer-to-peer traffic. In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated attack model that not only makes malcode payloads look like nominal ones, but which is also assumed to be both aware of and exploitative of the white-listing itself in forming a Trojan mechanism. In other words, the malware attempts to embed its malcode into the prevalent content that is normally white-listed. If the malcode is encrypted, the attacker will also attempt to obfuscate its plain-text decryption code as much as possible. Both current string-based and instructionbased systems will likely fail to detect such attacks.

Efficient fingerprint extraction for high performance Intrusion Detection System,"Haiyang Jiang; Gaogang Xie; Salamatian, K.","Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2013 IEEE Symposium on",20140306,2013,,,179,184,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) module in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) consists of two components: Pre-filter and Rule Verification (RV). Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction.

Anomaly-based approaches in intrusion detection systems have the advantage of being able to detect unknown attacks; they look for patterns that deviate from the normal behavior. We have proposed an approach of anomaly intrusion detection system by using Gaussian mixture model. This method learns patterns of normal and intrusive activities to classify that use a set of Gaussian probability distribution functions.

Many solutions have been proposed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection systems with many different techniques such as data mining approaches are employed to maximize the detection rate of intrusions while reducing false alarm rate. For instance, many clustering techniques are recommended which segregate normal and abnormal data in IDSs. Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features.

PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters,"Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on",20090127,2008,,,73,80,"PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.",,978-1-4244-3783-2,978-1-4244-2796-3,10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368,,Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic,computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases,Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler,,2,,22,,,8-10 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

A data mining framework for building intrusion detection models,"Wenke Lee; Stolfo, S.J.; Mok, K.W.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY, USA","Security and Privacy, 1999. Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on",20020806,1999,,,120,132,"There is often the need to update an installed intrusion detection system (IDS) due to new attack methods or upgraded computing environments. Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and slow. We describe a data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection (ID) models. The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models. We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification, meta-learning, association rules, and frequent episodes.

A high throughput string matching architecture for intrusion detection and prevention,"Lin Tan; Sherwood, T.","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings. 32nd International Symposium on",20050620,2005,,,112,122,"Network intrusion detection and prevention systems have emerged as one of the most effective ways of providing security to those connected to the network, and at the heart of almost every modern intrusion detection system is a string matching algorithm. String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule.

In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must port over a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains.

LCN 2008. 33rd IEEE Conference on",20081031,2008,,,911,918,"A real-time packet-level anomaly detection approach for high-speed network intrusion prevention is described. The approach is suitable for small and fast hardware implementation and was designed to be embedded in network appliances. Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space.

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language.

Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device.

In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption.

Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters.

Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic.

Zebu: A Language-Based Approach for Network Protocol Message Processing,"Burgy, L.; Reveillere, L.; Lawall, J.; Muller, G.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20110728,2011,37,4,575,591,"A network application communicates with other applications according to a set of rules known as a protocol. This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.",0098-5589,,,10.1109/TSE.2010.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528,Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing,Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server,Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing,ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols,,5,,34,,6/17/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Mobile ad hoc networks do not use any predefined infrastructure during the communication so that all the present mobile nodes which are want to communicate with each other immediately form the topology and initiates the request for data packets to send or receive. In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s).

The scale of damage that could be done on these infrastructures by well-planned cyber-attacks is enormous. Most of the research work done for the security of these critical infrastructures focuses on conventional security measures. In this paper, we designed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is based on the novel approach of Honey Token based Encrypted Pointers to prevent critical infrastructure networks from cyber-attacks particularly from zero day cyber threats. These honey tokens inside the frame will serve as a trap for the attacker. All nodes operating within the working domain of critical infrastructure network are divided into four different pools. This division is based according to their computational power and level of vulnerability. These pools are provided with different levels of security measures within the network. IDS use different number of Honey Tokens (HT) per frame for every different pool. Moreover every pool uses different types of encryption schemes (AES-128,192,256) etc. We use critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes for our simulations. We analyzed the performance of IDS in terms of True Positive and False Negative Alarms. Finally we test this IDS through Network Penetration Testing (NPT). This NPT is accomplished by putting the critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes directly under the zero day cyber-attacks and then we analyze the behavior of the IDS under such realistic conditions.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed.

Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup.

The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods.

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues.

In network intrusions, there may be multiple computing nodes that are attacked by intruders. The evidences of intrusions have to be gathered from all such attacked nodes. An intruder may move between multiple nodes in the network to conceal the origin of attack, or misuse some compromised hosts to launch the attack on other nodes. To detect such intrusion activities spread over the whole network, we present a new intrusion detection system (IDS) called distributed intrusion detection using mobile agents (DIDMA). DIDMA uses a set of software entities called mobile agents that can move from one node to another node within a network, and perform the task of aggregation and correlation of the intrusion related data that it receives from another set of software entities called the static agents. Mobile agents reduce network bandwidth usage by moving data analysis computation to the location of the intrusion data, support heterogeneous plat-forms, and offer a lot of flexibility in creating a distributed IDS. DIDMA utilizes the above-mentioned beneficial features offered by mobile agent technology and addresses some of the issues with centralized IDS models.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

Collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS): a framework for accurate and efficient IDS,"Yu-Sung Wu; Foo, Bingrui; Yongguo Mei; Bagchi, S.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual",20040108,2003,,,234,244,"We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.",,0-7695-2041-3,,10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328,,Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel,Internet;belief networks;security of data,Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors,,12,,19,,,8-12 Dec. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category.

Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naive fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naive fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET.

Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical.

Tiruchirappalli, Tiruchirappalli, India","Internet (AH-ICI), 2011 Second Asian Himalayas International Conference on",20111229,2011,,,1,5,"In recent years the attack vectors in the network world have increased many fold with the increased usage of Internet and with the exponential growth of various applications. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing.

Unicode-proof code injection attack on Windows CE  A novel approach of evading intrusion detection system for mobile network,Yang Song; Yuqing Zhang; Yingfei Sun; JingBo Yan,"Nat. Comput.

The key section of code injection attack is a small piece of code, called shellcode, which performs unauthorized operations when it is injected into software as part of valid data. On Windows CE, input data are often encoded using Unicode before being processed. In such cases, shellcode should be built in a way that bypasses such encoding; that is, it should be Unicode-proof. Unicode-proof shellcode also has great advantage of evading instruction detection system. However, it is quite difficult to build Unicode-proof shellcode for the ARM architecture, on which most embedded devices are developed, because the subset of instructions that can be used to write Unicode-proof shellcode is very limited. Moreover, the instruction cache in the ARM processor restricts the application of self-modifying code, which is frequently used in shellcode writing. This novel research proposes an approach to building ARM Unicode-proof shellcode on Windows CE under these constraints. The approach applies to all versions of ARM processors and Windows CE, including systems evolved from Windows CE, such as Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.

The most important aspect of this platform is represented by its capability of detecting and rejecting possible intruders. The paper discusses in a critical way the traditional views of intrusion detection and analyzes the more complex approach to human immune system.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack.

VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion.

Bayesian Model Averaging of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Intrusion Detection,"Liyuan Xiao; Yetian Chen; Chang, C.K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Iowa State Univ.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.",,,,10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903117,Bayesian Model Averaging;Bayesian network;Intrusion detection system;detection accuracy,Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training,belief networks;pattern classification;security of data;statistical analysis,BN classifiers;BNMA classifier;Bayesian model averaging;Bayesian network classifiers;KDD Cup 99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;detection accuracy;heuristic methods;intrusion detection;probability distribution;reasoning capabilities,,0,,27,,,21-25 July 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

These strategies are used as a defensive mechanism to defend against malicious attacks and also the nodes monitor their neighbours continuously and stores the information about the packets sent and received based on which the subsequent stages of the game are carried forward.",,978-1-4673-5843-9,,10.1109/ICPRIME.2013.6496490,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496490,Bayesian Game;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Adhoc Networks;Network Security,Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Receivers,Bayes methods;game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,Bayesian game concept;defensive mechanism;frontline security;game theoretic model;intrusion detection modelling;malicious attacks;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;non cooperative game;security threats,,1,,15,,,21-22 Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids.

Multi-layer Intrusion Detection and Defence Mechanisms Based on Immunity,Zhanfei Ma; Xuefeng Zheng,"Sch. of Inf. Eng., Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Beijing","Genetic and Evolutionary Computing, 2008. WGEC '08. Second International Conference on",20081003,2008,,,281,284,"Recently network intrusion detection is one of the hottest research topics. Existing network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has drawbacks in many aspects, among of which the two outstanding problems are the high ratio of false alarms and the lack of self-adaptation. The powerful information processing capabilities of the biological immune system, such as feature extraction, pattern recognition, learning, memory, and its distributive multi-layer defence mechanisms provide rich metaphors for designing a computer immune defence system. In this approach, the authors propose a novel multi-layer defence mechanisms based on immunity, which is capable of detecting and identifying both known and unknown intrusions, elaborating a specialized response measure. Besides that, the proposed defence mechanisms have the same learning and adaptive capability of the biological immune system, and so it is able to monitor networked computer's activities at different levels, and to improve its response under subsequent exposures to the same attack.

It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).",1550-6002,978-1-4244-8078-4,978-0-7695-4131-0,10.1109/QSIC.2010.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949,Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression,Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing,computer network security;program testing,IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing,,3,,21,,,14-15 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied.

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order.

This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack.

It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads.

Our approach is based on analyzing HTTP Transaction metadata, including Request method, Request Headers, Status Code, and Response Headers. We implemented an alert verification module, reconfigured ModSecurity, modified a subset of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and developed knowledge-base of web attack vectors to evaluate our method. We show that our approach significantly reduces false and non-relevant alerts with quite low processing overhead, thus enhances the quality of the results.",,,,10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994044,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994044,HTTP Protocol;Intrusion Detection System;Web Application Firewall;alert verification;web attack,Accuracy;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Protocols;Web servers,Internet;computer network security;hypermedia;meta data;transport protocols,HTTP protocol;HTTP transaction metadata analysis;OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set;WAF;Web IDS;Web application firewalls;Web attack;Web attack vector knowledge-base;Web driven alert verification;Web intrusion detection systems;Web server;alert verification module;reconfigured ModSecurity;request headers;request method;status code,,0,,20,,,3-4 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

CompactDFA: Scalable Pattern Matching Using Longest Prefix Match Solutions,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya, Israel","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20140417,2014,22,2,415,428,"A central component in all contemporary intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is their pattern matching algorithms, which are often based on constructing and traversing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that represents the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

Hence, exploring and addressing the problems have become one of the most urgent issues in parallel IDS. In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system.

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle.

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power.

We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory.

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.",,978-1-59593-580-9,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536,intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering,Costs;Engines;Face detection;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Reconfigurable architectures;Scalability;Software performance;Throughput,computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security,DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture,,1,,17,,,3-5 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

High performance string matching algorithm for a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS),"Weinsberg, Y.; Tzur-David, S.; Dolev, D.; Anker, T.",Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem,"High Performance Switching and Routing, 2006 Workshop on",20061016,2006,,,7 pp.,,"Intrusion detection systems (IDS) were developed to identify and report attacks in the late 1990s, as hacker attacks and network worms began to affect the Internet. Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation.

A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731,Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine,Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput,deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching,ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching,,1,,30,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Rule Hashing for Efficient Packet Classification in Network Intrusion Detection,"Yoshioka, A.; Shaikot, S.H.; Min Sik Kim","Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2008. ICCCN '08. Proceedings of 17th International Conference on",20081117,2008,,,1,6,"A rule-based intrusion detection system compares the incoming packets against rule set in order to detect intrusion. Unfortunately, it spends the majority of CPU time in packet classification to search for rules that match each packet. A common approach is to build a graph such as rule trees or finite automata for a given rule set, and traverse it using a packet as an input string. Because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. Exploring such a huge graph becomes a major bottleneck in high-speed networks since each packet incurs many memory accesses with little locality. In this paper, we propose rule hashing for fast packet classification in intrusion detection systems. The rule hashing, combined with hierarchical rule trees, saves memory and reduce the number of memory accesses by allowing the whole working set to be accommodated in a cache in most of the time, and thus improves response times in finding matching rules. We implement our algorithm in Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system.

In addition to having privileged access to organization resources and information, these users may be familiar with the defenses surrounding valuable assets. Computers systems at the organization need a mechanism for communicating suspicious activity that is difficult for a malicious insider (or even an outsider) to detect or block. In this work, we propose a covert channel in the Ethernet frame that allows a computer system to report activity inside other, unrelated network communication. The covert channel leverages the differences in the framing approaches used by Ethernet and IP packets to append hidden information to IP packet and transmit it to an organization's administrator. This stealthy communication is difficult for even advanced attackers and is challenging to block since it opportunistically uses unrelated communication. Further, since the transmission is tied to the Ethernet frame, the communication cannot traverse network routers, preventing security information from leaving the organization.

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions.

Providing an online IDS to the storage controller is essential for dealing with compromised hosts or coordinated attacks by multiple hosts. SAN block storage controllers are connected to the world via block-level protocols, such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. Usually, block-level storage systems do not maintain information specific to the file-system using them. The range of threats that can be handled at the block level is limited. A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions. IDStor maintains a block-to-file mapping that is updated online.

This model is different from traditional IDS, we use BVM classifier to differentiate the normal and abnormal attacks, and we added a pre-process module before the classifier. In the pre-process module, we use LLE to extract the main features of the intrusion data, which is the main part of the pre-process module, and then the principal components of the data are used as input of BVM classifier that differentiates the normal and abnormal actions.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core.

We observe that different attack instances can be derived from each other using simple transformations. We model these transformations as inference rules in a natural-deduction system. Starting from an exemplary attack instance, we use an inference engine to automatically generate all possible instances derived by a set of rules. The result is a simple yet powerful tool capable of both generating attack instances for NIDS testing and determining whether a given sequence of packets is an attack. In several testing phases using different sets of rules, our tool exposed serious vulnerabilities in Snort - a widely deployed NIDS.

Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Local Computer Networks, 2009. LCN 2009. IEEE 34th Conference on",20091218,2009,,,899,906,"Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.",,978-1-4244-4488-5,978-1-4244-4487-8,10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038,,Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic,IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats,,0,,23,,,20-23 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The NIDS cannot always determine what traffic reaches a given host nor how that host will interpret the traffic, and attackers may exploit this ambiguity to avoid detection or cause misleading alarms. We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests.

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort.

To protect such archives, we propose a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack.

AC-Suffix-Tree: Buffer Free String Matching on Out-of-Sequence Packets,"Xinming Chen; Kailin Ge; Chen, Zhen; Jun Li","Dept. of Autom., Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2011 Seventh ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20111031,2011,,,36,44,"TCP and IP fragmentation can be used to evade signature detection at Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS / IPS). Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.",,978-1-4577-1454-2,978-0-7695-4521-9,10.1109/ANCS.2011.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710,Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching,Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security,buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching,AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection,,0,,12,,,3-4 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

While static defence technologies such as firewalls and anti-virus provide basic protection for computer networks, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can improve overall security by identifying and responding to novel malicious activities.

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means.

They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications.

Anomaly-Based Behavior Analysis of Wireless Network Security,"Fayssal, S.; Hariri, S.; Al-Nashif, Y.","Univ. of Arizona, Tucson","Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking & Services, 2007. MobiQuitous 2007. Fourth Annual International Conference on",20080212,2007,,,1,8,"The exponential growth in wireless network faults, vulnerabilities, and attacks make the wireless local area network (WLAN) security management a challenging research area. Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.",,978-1-4244-1024-8,978-1-4244-1025-5,10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054,,Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks,data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels,WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network,,4,1,24,,,6-10 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility.

We propose a memory-efficient multiple-character-approaching architecture consisting of multiple parallel deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called TDP-DFA. By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity. We also present a novel scheme to share the storage of transition rules among multiple DFAs, substantially decreasing the total storage cost, and avoiding the cost increase being proportional to the number of DFAs.

The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the Search phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.",,978-0-7695-2858-9,,10.1109/ICNS.2007.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321,,Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system,,0,,15,,,19-25 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sum tradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eight fields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which both privacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.,,978-0-7695-3102-1,,10.1109/ARES.2008.189,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529343,privacy-enhanced security data sharing,Access control;Automation;Collaboration;Data privacy;Data security;Information analysis;Information security;Pattern analysis;Protection;Risk analysis,data privacy;security of data,anonymized packet traces;distributed security analysis;intrusion detection system alarms;network data;privacy protection;security analysis capability,,0,,32,,,4-7 March 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

In this article, a multi-layer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system is designed and developed to achieve high efficiency and improve the detection and classification rate accuracy inspired by immune systems with negative selection approach. In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.",,978-1-4799-2438-7,,10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920485,Artificial Immune System;Intrusion Classification;Machine Learning;Network Intrusion Detection,Niobium;Probes,Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic,DoS attacks;IDS;J48 decision tree classifier;NSL-KDD benchmark data set;PCA algorithm;R2L;U2R;anomalies detection;anomalous traffic;anomaly detectors;classification approach;feature selection;genetic algorithm;immune systems;multilayer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron neural network;naive Bayes classifier;negative selection approach;normal traffic;principal component analysis algorithm;probe attacks,,1,,25,,,4-6 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks.

It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool.

A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder","Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2007. SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,678,684,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, (1) impacts system performance, (2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, (3) addresses bad mouthing and (4) resists collusion.",,1-4244-1268-4,1-4244-1268-4,10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292881,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292881,,Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Resists;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML,XML;telecommunication security;wireless LAN,802.11 network;XML based policy engine;bad mouthing;centralized trust authority;misbehaving nodes;physical layer information;reputation vector;reputation-enabled intrusion detection system;software programmable devices;wireless networks,,3,,22,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line.

Proceedings 17th Annual",20020807,2001,,,3,11,"An intrusion detection system (IDS), that monitors passively specific computing resources, and reports anomalous or intrusive activities, is becoming an important component in the security system of information infrastructure. Algorithms for detecting intrusions are under rapid development, but far from being mature. One interesting and difficult issue is how to study and test a new intrusion detection algorithm against a variety of (perhaps simulated) intrusive activities under realistic background traffic. A flexible and general-purpose platform for testing intrusion detection algorithms is clearly desirable. This paper presents such a software platform, called IntruDetector. With this platform, detection algorithms can be tested directly in a real environment with a wide range of intrusive activities. The data of normal system activities are directly collected from the live environment, and are mixed with intrusive activities that are simulated by hybrid simulation. The main properties of this approach are: (1) the background traffic is realistic; (2) it allows flexible simulation of various types of intrusions; and (3) normal system operation will not be disrupted by virtually simulated destructive intrusions during testing.",,0-7695-1405-7,,10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991516,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991516,,Algorithm design and analysis;Data security;Detection algorithms;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Software algorithms;Software testing;System testing;Traffic control,authorisation;hybrid simulation;program testing,IDS;IntruDetector;algorithm testing;flexible simulation;hybrid simulation;information infrastructure;intrusion detection system;monitoring;network intrusion detection;realistic background traffic;security information;software platform,,1,,24,,,10-14 Dec. 2001,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions.

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on",20030206,2003,,,10 pp.,,"This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.",,0-7695-1874-5,,10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909,,Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance,Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models,Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets,,15,,30,,,6-9 Jan. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection.

Min-max hyperellipsoidal clustering for anomaly detection in network security,"Sarasamma, S.T.; Zhu, Q.A.","Northrop Grumman Mission Syst., Bellevue, NE","Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on",20060717,2006,36,4,887,901,"A novel hyperellipsoidal clustering technique is presented for an intrusion-detection system in network security. Hyperellipsoidal clusters toward maximum intracluster similarity and minimum intercluster similarity are generated from training data sets. The novelty of the technique lies in the fact that the parameters needed to construct higher order data models in general multivariate Gaussian functions are incrementally derived from the data sets using accretive processes. The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator.

In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naive Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features.

It is light-weight in the sense that the intrusion detection system (IDS) used for estimating the trust that one node has for another, consumes limited computational resource. Moreover, it uses only local information thereby ensuring scalability. Our light-weight IDS takes care of two kinds of attacks, namely, the blackhole attack and the grey hole attack.

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS).

Motivated by the problems of UlakNet with the P2P traffic, we propose a novel method for P2P traffic-detection in the network backbone in this paper. Observing the similarity between detecting traffic that belongs to a specific protocol and detecting an intrusion in a computer system, we adopt an intrusion detection system (IDS) technique to detect P2P traffic.

XFA: Faster Signature Matching with Extended Automata,"Smith, R.; Estan, C.; Jha, S.","Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI","Security and Privacy, 2008. SP 2008. IEEE Symposium on",20080528,2008,,,187,201,"Automata-based representations and related algorithms have been applied to address several problems in information security, and often the automata had to be augmented with additional information. For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.",1081-6011,978-0-7695-3168-7,,10.1109/SP.2008.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153,finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching,Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata,extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity,,35,3,33,,,18-22 May 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

In these applications, delivering information to multiple receivers at the same time makes multicast communication is the next generation dominated data transmission mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks. In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study.

PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification.

International Conference on",20090626,2009,,,1124,1129,"Testing network-based security tools such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) differs from testing ordinary network tools (e.g., routers and switches). Basically, in addition to the parameters (such as bandwidth utilization, routing information and packets timing) that are important for network tools, security tools are more sensitive to issues like traffic composition, contents, and session level parameters. Generating a realistic synthetic traffic that keeps all the characteristics of the real traffic has proved to be difficult. For this reason, security testers often use real traffic traces in their test or evaluation. However, the available traces are often limited in number or size. Therefore, it is necessary to merge and manipulate traces to create a test environment that would be representative of the operational environment, and to inject attacks into the traffic. A variety of tools for recording, replaying as well as forging packets can be obtained easily, but there exist very few tools for manipulating traces so as to modify the traffic composition from the networking viewpoint. Among them, surprisingly there is no tool for manipulating traces without destructing their security-relevant characteristics.

Bitmap Algorithms for Counting Active Flows on High-Speed Links,"Estan, C.; Varghese, G.; Fisk, M.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Wisconsin Univ., Madison, WI","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20061016,2006,14,5,925,937,"This paper presents a family of bitmap algorithms that address the problem of counting the number of distinct header patterns (flows) seen on a high-speed link. Such counting can be used to detect DoS attacks and port scans and to solve measurement problems. Counting is especially hard when processing must be done within a packet arrival time (8 ns at OC-768 speeds) and, hence, may perform only a small number of accesses to limited, fast memory. A naive solution that maintains a hash table requires several megabytes because the number of flows can be above a million. By contrast, our new probabilistic algorithms use little memory and are fast. The reduction in memory is particularly important for applications that run multiple concurrent counting instances. For example, we replaced the port-scan detection component of the popular intrusion detection system Snort with one of our new algorithms. This reduced memory usage on a ten minute trace from 50 to 5.6 MB while maintaining a 99.77% probability of alarming on a scan within 6 s of when the large-memory algorithm would. The best known prior algorithm (probabilistic counting) takes four times more memory on port scan detection and eight times more on a measurement application.

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as virus free by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048  128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area.

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying blindspots in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection.

These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume.

Unveiling flat traffic on the Internet: An SSH attack case study,"Jonker, M.; Hofstede, R.; Sperotto, A.; Pras, A.","Centre for Telematics & Inf. Technol. (CTIT), Univ. of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Integrated Network Management (IM), 2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on",20150702,2015,,,270,278,"Many types of brute-force attacks are known to exhibit a characteristic `flat' behavior at the network-level, meaning that connections belonging to an attack feature a similar number of packets and bytes, and duration. Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.",,,,10.1109/INM.2015.7140301,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301,,Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes,Internet;computer network security;security of data,IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks,,0,,14,,,11-15 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Partial character decoding for improved regular expression matching in FPGAs,"Sutton, P.","Sch. of Inf. Technol. & Electr.

This paper extends the modular NFA construction method of Sidhu and Prasanna to handle the processing of many bytes in parallel. The paper also introduces the concept of partial character decoding in which character match units are shared but the number of signals needed to be routed around the FPGA is reduced over previous shared-decoder approaches. With these approaches, throughput over 5Gbps is achieved for the full default Snort rule-set (23401 literals) in a Xilinx Virtex-2 6000 FPGA.

These packet inspections typically require considerable delay often consuming more than 70% of the IDS processing time. Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.",,978-1-4244-1513-7,978-1-4244-1513-7,10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922,Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber,Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design,,,,2,,14,,,29-31 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Much work has been done in this field; however, most of the prior work results in low memory efficiency (defined as the ratio of the amount of the required storage in bytes and the size of the dictionary in number of characters). Due to such inefficiency, state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose an algorithm called leaf-attaching to preprocess a given dictionary without increasing the number of patterns. The resulting set of postprocessed patterns can be searched using any tree-search data structure. We also present a scalable, high-throughput, Memory-efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM) based on a pipelined binary search tree. The proposed algorithm and architecture achieve a memory efficiency of 0.56 (for the Rogets dictionary) and 1.32 (for the Snort dictionary). As a result, our design scales well to support larger dictionaries. Implementations on 45 nm ASIC and a state-of-the-art FPGA device (for latest Rogets and Snort dictionaries) show that our architecture achieves 24 and 3.2 Gbps, respectively. The MASM module can simply be duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle.

Our proposed algorithm performs independently partial pattern matching to extract the pattern from incoming multiple packets at multi gigabit network. The IPM is implemented by FPGA, TCAM and SRAM. Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.",1530-1346,978-1-4244-7754-8,,10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496,,Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols,,,,1,,24,,,22-25 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naive Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naive Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.",,978-1-4673-1366-7,,10.1109/UKSim.2012.116,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441,Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines,Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines,Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines,JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique,,0,,22,,,28-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

SCIDIVE: a stateful and cross protocol intrusion detection architecture for voice-over-IP environments,"Yu-Sung Wu; Bagchi, S.; Garg, S.; Singh, N.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Dependable Systems and Networks, 2004 International Conference on",20040726,2004,,,433,442,"Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems are gaining in popularity as the technology for transmitting voice traffic over IP networks. As the popularity of VoIP systems increases, they are being subjected to different kinds of intrusions some of which are specific to such systems and some of which follow a general pattern. VoIP systems pose several new challenges to intrusion detection system (IDS) designers. First, these systems employ multiple protocols for call management (e.g., SIP) and data delivery (e.g., RTP). Second, the systems are distributed in nature and employ distributed clients, servers and proxies. Third, the attacks to such systems span a large class, from denial of service to billing fraud attacks. Finally, the systems are heterogeneous and typically under several different administrative domains. In this paper, we propose the design of an intrusion detection system targeted to VoIP systems, called SCIDIVE (pronounced Skydive). SCIDIVE is structured to detect different classes of intrusions, including, masquerading, denial of service, and media stream-based attacks. It can operate with both classes of protocols that compose VoIP systems - call management protocols (CMP), e.g., SIP, and media delivery protocols (MDP), e.g., RTP. SCIDIVE proposes two abstractions for VoIP IDS - stateful detection and cross-protocol detection. Stateful detection denotes assembling state from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching engine. Cross protocol detection denotes matching rules that span multiple protocols. SCIDIVE is demonstrated on a sample VoIP system that comprises SIP clients and SIP proxy servers with RTP as the data delivery protocol. Four attack scenarios are created and the accuracy and the efficiency of the system evaluated with rules meant to catch these attacks.",,0-7695-2052-9,,10.1109/DSN.2004.1311913,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311913,,Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;IP networks;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Streaming media;Sun;Telecommunication traffic,IP networks;Internet telephony;client-server systems;data communication;protocols;security of data,IP networks;SCIDIVE;SIP proxy servers;VoIP systems;billing fraud attacks;call management protocols;cross-protocol detection;data delivery;denial-of-service intrusion;intrusion detection;masquerading intrusion;media delivery protocols;media stream-based attacks;rule-matching engine;stateful detection;voice traffic transmition;voice-over-IP,,29,4,17,,,28 June-1 July 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports. Based on our validation, we then identify and make available a list of 138 good Snort signatures, i.e., signatures that were effective in identifying validated malware without producing false positives. In addition, we compare the characteristics of good and regular signatures and highlight a number of differences.

Here, the term `bad character' is a character that causes a mismatch. While checking multiple bytes in scanning the text at a time, the BLAST algorithm overcomes the reduction of the average shift value in a typical search, which is caused by the dependency on the multi-byte search unit (MBSU) and the large frequency of the last character of the given patterns. From the theoretical analysis, the authors validate the correctness of the BLAST algorithm. Also, from the experimental results across different setups, the authors show that the BLAST algorithm provides the faster search time than the other algorithms. For example, the authors obtain an enhancement by as much as 212.41% on average for various numbers of attack patterns and attack traffic conditions compared with that of the modified Wu-Manber algorithm.

Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process.

Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409,Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM),Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput,content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures,TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces,,0,,37,,7/22/2013,Jun-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible.

SecPerU 2006. Second International Workshop on",20060710,2006,,,9 pp.,15,"Ad hoc routing protocols have been designed to efficiently reroute traffic when confronted with network congestion, faulty nodes, and dynamically changing topologies. The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS",,0-7695-2549-0,,10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271,IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.,Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic,ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security,MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network,,3,,16,,,29-29 June 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0430, Email: damon.mccoy@cs.colorado.edu","Networking Technologies for Software Define Radio Networks, 2007 2nd IEEE Workshop on",20071015,2007,,,48,54,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance, 2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses bad mouthing and 4) resists collusion.",,1-4244-1315-X,1-4244-1316-8,10.1109/SDRN.2007.4348973,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4348973,,Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Standards development;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML,,,,0,,22,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Towards dynamic self-tuning for intrusion detection systems,"Sun-il Kim; Nwanze, N.; Kintner, J.","Electr. & Comput. Syst. Eng., Univ. of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, USA","Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC), 2010 IEEE 29th International",20110106,2010,,,17,24,"Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems pattern the normal activity and are attractive in that new, never-seen attacks can be detected. In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs.

This supports creation of an environment in which state-of-the-art intrusion detection algorithms easily can be inserted. The modular design also allows for detection algorithms to be enabled and disabled when required. Additionally, the architecture uses a sensor reconfiguration mechanism to affect the amount of data collected. When a detection algorithm is enabled or disabled, the sensor providing the input data to the algorithm is correspondingly reconfigured. This implies a minimum of excess collected data.

Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets.

Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested.

In this paper, we describe our efforts to develop a database and query language for network attack data from firewalls, intrusion detection systems and honeynets. Our first step toward this objective is to develop a prototype database and query interface to identify coordinated scanning activity in network attack data. We have created a set of aggregate views and templatized SQL queries that consider timing, persistence, targeted services, spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion, thereby enabling us to evaluate coordinated scanning along these dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of the interface by conducting a case study on a set of firewall and intrusion detection system logs from Dshield.org. We show that the interface is able to identify general characteristics of coordinated activity as well as instances of unusual activity that would otherwise be difficult to mine from the data. These results highlight the potential for developing a more generalized query language for a broad class of network intrusion data. The case study also exposes some of the challenges we face in extending our system to more generalized queries over potentially vast quantities of data.",,0-7695-2571-7,,10.1109/ICDEW.2006.149,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623823,,Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data engineering;Data mining;Data security;Database languages;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection,,,,2,,17,,,2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Scalable Packet Classification for Datacenter Networks,Pi-Chung Wang,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Nat. Chung Hsing Univ., Taichung, Taiwan","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20131219,2014,32,1,124,137,"The key challenge to a datacenter network is its scalability to handle many customers and their applications. In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489,Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability,Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software,computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines,VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty,,1,,48,,,Jan-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

IDS is designed to be a passive entity that is they are invisible to others on the network but this same capability is a handicap when it comes to blocking malicious packets at runtime, which is an essential feature of a Firewall, as it compromises its passive nature. In this paper a firewall architecture is discussed which uses IDS as a core engine for detecting threats and yet retains the ability to block any packet. The architecture employs hardware software co-simulation in order to process packets in real time. The IDS core is mapped onto an FPGA which is responsible for threat perception while the software implements the pass/block mechanism based on the IDS decision. Inside the FPGA, all the rules are applied in parallel on each packet achieving speedup not possible in software.

With OWD meter performance of TCP protocol was measured when generating DNS-like traffic. Performance of UDP protocol was measured when generating two gamming traffic patterns and one VoIP call. With RTT meter performance of TCP and UDP protocols was measured for different packet sizes and exponential distribution of inter-departure time.

A resource efficient content inspection system for next generation Smart NICs,"Sabhanatarajan, K.; Gordon-Ross, A.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL","Computer Design, 2008. ICCD 2008. IEEE International Conference on",20090119,2008,,,156,163,"The aggregate power consumption of the Internet is increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the rapid increase in the number of connected edge devices such as desktop PCs. Despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of PCs have their power management features disabled. Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection.

Any adverse impact that these observed trends may have on Internet traffic flows can result in sub par performance, which in turn results in unsatisfactory user experience. To study such adverse impacts, we examine in this paper the flow-level performance of popular applications across a range of size-based flow-classes and applications. We use out-of-sequence packets, retransmissions, throughput, and RTTs as key flow performance metrics. Leveraging data sets collected from two complementary network environments, we compare these metrics for popular applications and for the up/downstream directions. We show that irrespective of the direction, flows are severely impacted by the specifics of the network, e.g., DSL or CDN and application behavior. We also find that, in general, this impact differs markedly across the different flow-classes. In particular, contrary to popular belief, the small flows from all applications, which make up the majority of flows, experience significant retransmissions, while the very large flows, although small in number, experience very limited retransmissions. In terms of application-related performance, we observe that especially when compared to HTTP, apart from large flows, P2P flows suffer from continuously high retransmissions and low throughput.

Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated.

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152,,Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils,content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data,NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories,,1,,12,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning booster technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of no-match cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of bad but cheap hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for on-access virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user.

Testing an implementation against FSBs can avoid consequences due to exploits of FSBs such as denial of services, corruption of application states, etc. Obtaining an adequate test data set is essential for testing of FSBs. An adequate test data set contains effective test cases that can reveal FSBs. Unfortunately, traditional techniques do not address the issue of adequate testing of an application for FSB. Moreover, the application of source code mutation has not been applied for testing FSB. In this work, we apply the idea of mutation-based testing technique to generate an adequate test data set for testing FSBs. Our work addresses FSBs related to ANSI C libraries. We propose eight mutation operators to force the generation of adequate test dataset.

Distributed Authentication of Program Integrity Verification in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Chang, K.; Shin, K.G.","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Michigan Univ., Ann Arbor, MI","Securecomm and Workshops, 2006",20070515,2006,,,1,10,"Security in wireless sensor networks has become important as sensor networks are being used for an increasing number of applications. The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops. We also analyze the security of DAPP under different attack models, demonstrating its capability to deal with various types of attacks",,1-4244-0423-1,1-4244-0423-1,10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359561,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198821,,Authentication;Capacitive sensors;Communication system security;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Network servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks,protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Blundo scheme;Mica2 Motes;distributed authentication;distributed authentication protocol;node capture;physical tampering;program integrity verification;sensor program manipulation;severe resource constraints;soft tamper-proofing scheme;wireless sensor networks security,,1,4,22,,,Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Signature Tree Generation for Polymorphic Worms,Yong Tang; Bin Xiao; Xicheng Lu,"Coll. of Comput., Nat.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined more specific relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2010.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493,Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation,,digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures,NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering,,7,,36,,6/17/2010,Apr-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

A feature that is selected by these experts implies its importance in detecting network intrusions.

GLOBECOM '05. IEEE",20060123,2005,2,,5 pp.,,"This paper proposes a cost effective architecture for network security switch to deep inspect the traffic among switching ports. A security service engine (SSE) with packet deep inspection ability is also designed to accompany with manageable L2 switches. By properly configuring the VLAN parameters, packets from switch ports of the L2 switch are forwarded to the SSE, via the gigabit Ethernet interface, for deeply inspection. For security reason, abnormal/malicious packets are dropped by the SSE directly while normal packets are forwarded back to the switch to the correct output port. To evaluate the performance and latency of the proposed architecture, a cost effective P4-based SSE is also implemented as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS) with layer-7 content inspection function. The obtained measurements show that the proposed architecture is practical with high throughput and low latency. With IPC-based SSE implementation, the traditional L2 switches can now provide content security service in a very cost effective way.",,0-7803-9414-3,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577789,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577789,,Cost function;Delay;Engines;Ethernet networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Security;Switches;Telecommunication traffic,local area networks;packet switching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,gigabit Ethernet interface;intrusion detection and prevention system;network security switch architecture;packet deep inspection;security service engine,,1,,10,,,28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Compared with the traditional methods, the model designed here, which is totally insensitive to port numbers and contents of payload on application level, overcomes difficulty in operation caused by unreliable port numbers and complexity of payload interpretation. Rather than relatively complex ML algorithms or even in mixture, supervised k-Nearest Neighbor estimator is adopted for the sake of computational efficiency, along with the effective and easy-to-calculate statistical features selected according to the operational background.

This paper reports some preliminary findings in our research into building a secure append-only storage system. It discusses a possible secure append-only storage architecture that could be used to detect and prevent deletion or modification by inside/outside attackers. A specific implementation of the architecture based on block device drivers and magnetic storage firmwares is alsopresented.",,0-7695-2059-6,,10.1109/SISW.2003.10002,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410755,,Companies;Computer worms;Data security;Forensics;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Secure storage;Software systems,,,,0,,21,,,31-31 Oct. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process.

In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.",,,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073,,Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols,computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing,ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm,,3,,27,,,April 27 2014-May 2 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain.

In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured.

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn.

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes.

Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well.

IEEE International Symposium on",20091228,2009,,,1,10,"An emerging class of applications for enterprise wireless LANs (WLAN) is voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which impose a stringent requirement on end-to-end delay. Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device.

By monitoring packet loss rate and packet arrival rate, the routers can be traced as near as attack sources on victim flows, called approximate attack entry nodes (AENs), can be traced as near as attack sources. DATMS adopts on-line analysis instead of post-mortem analysis to reduce the trace time.

The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by licit and illicit network applications.

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments.

Features Selection for Intrusion Detection Systems Based on Support Vector Machines,"Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON","Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2009. CCNC 2009. 6th IEEE",20090218,2009,,,1,8,"Intrusion detection systems (EDSs) deal with large amounts of data containing irrelevant and/or redundant features. These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm.

This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns.

ARES '10 International Conference on",20100325,2010,,,321,326,Application based intrusion detection involves analysis of network packet payload data. Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.",,978-1-59593-082-8,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260,data-caches;multithreading;network processors,Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput,internetworking;multi-threading,asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses,,6,3,42,,,26-28 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA 10. KIDS core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties.

This type of attack can cost millions of dollars when the target is a critical resource such as a Web server or domain name server. Traditional methods, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems have failed to provide adequate protection from this type of attack. This paper presents a new protection method called a nozzle. The nozzle is based upon favorable aspects of firewalls and network pumps. It is deployed similar to a firewall such that all conversations from an untrusted user to a critical resource are monitored. The main advantage of the nozzle is the ability to provide a threshold for trusted traffic thus precluding new attacks. A nozzle consists of a series of rings. Each of which has a trusted and untrusted buffer, rules for packet placement, and rules for communication with the next level. Rings are placed in the protocol stack so they can protect particular protocols",,0-7695-0859-6,,10.1109/ACSAC.2000.898855,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898855,,Computer crime;Costs;Degradation;Ethernet networks;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Payloads;Protection;Protocols;Web server,authorisation;computer networks;protocols;telecommunication security,Web server;cost;denial of service protection;domain name server;firewalls;intrusion detection;network pumps;network resource;nozzle;packet placement;protocol;trusted traffic;untrusted user,,1,5,8,,,Dec-00,11 Dec 2000-15 Dec 2000,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks,"Song, Sui; Manikopoulos, C.N.",,"Information Assurance Workshop, 2006 IEEE",20060710,2006,,,348,360,"Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data.

With the proliferation of sensor networks at home, work place, and beyond, securing data in the network has become a challenge. A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol.

Such algorithms are widely used for testing intrusion detection systems. We investigate the notion of completeness of a mutation algorithm: its capability to generate all possible attack instances from a given set of attack transformations. We define the notion of a Phi-complete mutation algorithm. Given a set of transformations Phi, an algorithm is complete with respect to Phi, if it can generate every instance that the transformations in Phi derive. We show that if the rules in Phi are uniform and reversible then a Phi-complete algorithm exists. Intuitively speaking, uniform and reversible transformations mean that we can first exclusively apply transformations that simplify the attack, then exclusively apply transformations that complicate it, and still get all possible instances that are derived by the rules in Phi. Although uniformity and reversibility may appear severe restrictions, we show that common attack transformations are indeed uniform and reversible. Therefore, our Phi-complete algorithm can be incorporated into existing testing tools for intrusion detection systems. Furthermore, we show that a Phi-complete algorithm is useful, not only for testing purposes, but also for determining whether two packet traces are two different mutations of the same attack",1063-6900,0-7695-2615-2,,10.1109/CSFW.2006.21,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648707,,Computer security;Conferences;Encoding;Feeds;Genetic mutations;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;System testing;TCPIP;Uniform resource locators,security of data,Phi-complete mutation algorithm;attack mutation algorithms;attack transformations;intrusion detection systems;reversible transformations;transformations Phi;uniform transformations,,0,13,29,,,0-0 0,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.",1060-9857,978-0-7695-3826-6,,10.1109/SRDS.2009.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421,exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware,Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server,Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security,HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit,,1,1,36,,,27-30 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

They are designed to function without fixed infrastructure support. But, this design makes network security attacks hard to detect and control. For instance, an attacker could compromise one portion of the network by inducing a worm and then move to another portion of the network and replay the attack without being detected. In this paper, we describe a policy management system (PMS) that provides ubiquitous and consistent security policy control despite adverse conditions such as node mobility, node failures, network partitions, a compromise of the routing infrastructure, a high packet loss rate, and ongoing cyber attacks. We give performance results in a 47-node emulated network. Key challenges in tactical networks include a lossy environment with bit error rates as high as 0.001 and bandwidth as low as 500Kbits/s. TCP backs off in the face of packet loss and hence behaves poorly in such networks. Tactical network are also subject to cyber attacks that have the potential even to compromise the routing infrastructure. Our PMS architecture mitigates these issues by using a transport protocol that has two components, one oriented toward normal operation when the routing infrastructure is functioning and one oriented toward limited, but robust, operation even when the routing infrastructure has been compromised. In normal operation we use a reliable UDP protocol (RUDP) and in times of compromise we use a flooding protocol.",,978-1-4244-1513-7,978-1-4244-1513-7,10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455069,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455069,,Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Computer security;Control systems;Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Transport protocols;Wireless networks,,,,2,,13,,,29-31 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

An effective network-based Intrusion Detection using Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm augmented with near-deterministic detector generation,"Senhua Yu; Dasgupta, D.","Dept. of Comput.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.",,978-1-4244-9905-2,,10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393,CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic,Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing,Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines,CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation,,1,,18,,,11-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN","Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing, 2006. IEEE International Conference on",20060619,2006,1,,8 pp.,,"Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for collecting critical data in various applications. Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (invariants). These invariants are associated with conditions (the observed variables) of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network.

They have become stealthier over the years as a consequence of the ongoing struggle between attackers and system defenders. In order to explore the next step in rootkit evolution and to build strong defenses, we look at this issue from the point of view of an attacker. We construct Cloaker, a proof-of-concept rootkit for the ARM platform that is non- persistent and only relies on hardware state modifications for concealment and operation. A primary goal in the design of Cloaker is to not alter any part of the host operating system (OS) code or data, thereby achieving immunity to all existing rootkit detection techniques which perform integrity, behavior and signature checks of the host OS. Cloaker also demonstrates that a self-contained execution environment for malicious code can be provided without relying on the host OS for any services. Integrity checks of hardware state in each of the machine's devices are required in order to detect rootkits such as Cloaker. We present a framework for the Linux kernel that incorporates integrity checks of hardware state performed by device drivers in order to counter the threat posed by rootkits such as Cloaker.",1081-6011,978-0-7695-3168-7,,10.1109/SP.2008.8,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531160,ARM;operating system;rootkit;security,Computer science;Computer security;Counting circuits;Hardware;Immune system;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Operating systems;Privacy;Virtual machining,Linux;security of data,Cloaker;Linux kernel;device drivers;hardware state modifications;hardware supported rootkit concealment;malicious attackers;rootkit detection techniques;system defenders,,5,,57,,,18-22 May 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration.

We show how to implement efficient PEG-based scheduling methods using real time operating systems, and to re-use pre-optimized libraries of DSP components within such implementations. Empirical results show that the PEG strategy can 1) achieve significant speedups on a state of the art multicore signal processor platform for static dataflow applications with predictable execution times,and 2) exceed classical scheduling speedups for application shaving execution times that can vary dynamically.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.",,978-0-7695-2847-2,,10.1109/AINAW.2007.212,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118,,Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server,Internet;cryptography,HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems,,5,1,23,,,21-23 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Bayesian event classification for intrusion detection,"Kruegel, C.; Mutz, D.; Robertson, W.; Valeur, F.","Reliable Software Group, California Univ., Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual",20040108,2003,,,14,23,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information.

After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms.

Impact of Sanitized Message Flows in a Cooperative Intrusion Warning System,"Tolle, J.; Jahnke, M.; Felde, N.G.; Martini, P.","Res. Establ. for Appl. Sci., Wachtberg","Military Communications Conference, 2006. MILCOM 2006. IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,7,"This paper discusses the side effects of sanitizing IT security event messages in a cooperative multi-domain intrusion warning system (IWS). To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow",,1-4244-0617-X,1-4244-0618-8,10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733,,Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology,Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security,IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities,,1,1,17,,,23-25 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

However, existing approaches based on GHSOM are not able to adapt online to the ever-changing problem domain of network intrusion.

We test the capability of the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD'99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying unknown attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates.

With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the big-dataism. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud.

UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems.

Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier.

Therefore it is important to find methods to reduce that amount of data for applications like long-term archiving or filtering in mediators to improve scalability. A fact that helps here is, that general internet traffic has power-law characteristics and that for many applications it is enough to only look at the large flows. In this work we introduce Mouse Trapping, a flow data reduction method that keeps the large flow records, while the small flow records are aggregated or even removed. We show based on theoretical simulation, that because of the heavy-tail nature of normal flow data, the main part of the traffic is represented by only a few large flow records, while the small flow records represent only a small part of the traffic. In an evaluation with real traffic data we can confirm that the traffic flows are in fact mostly power-law distributed. We can show that with this method, flow data can be reduced by up to 90% if all small flow records are just discarded, affecting only flow records of 5% of the traffic.",,978-0-7695-3189-2,978-0-7695-3189-2,10.1109/ICIMP.2008.23,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561321,flows;network measurement;power-law;reduction,Computerized monitoring;Filtering;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Internet;Mice;Protection;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,data analysis;data reduction;traffic,flow based traffic measurement;flow data reduction method;flow records;mouse trapping;network management;power-law distributed,,1,1,15,,,June 29 2008-July 5 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools.

We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in Snorts ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it.

Using Search Methods for Selecting and Combining Software Sensors to Improve Fault Detection in Autonomic Systems,"Shevertalov, M.; Lynch, K.; Stehle, E.; Rorres, C.; Mancoridis, S.","Dept. of Comput.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

However, security modules in conventional kernel-level reference monitors are usually not portable to other kernels and require detailed knowledge about kernel internals. Furthermore, different security modules are often not composable and conflict with each other. This paper describes a reference monitor called SysGuard that addresses these problems. SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls. This paper describes the implementation of restricted execution environments for networks by composing simple and portable guards, and shows the advantages of the SysGuard security framework.",,0-7695-1852-4,,10.1109/PRDC.2002.1185635,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185635,,Access control;Computer bugs;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Guidelines;Kernel;Monitoring;Operating systems;Portable computers;Security,authorisation;operating system kernels;software portability;system monitoring,SysGuard;access control;guards;networks;operating system kernels;per-process jump table;portable composable kernel module;reference monitors;restricted execution environments;security modules;system calls,,2,,19,,,16-18 Dec. 2002,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for an auto-mated network management such as configuration, performance and anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an auto-mated network management based on hierarchical SOM that groups similar data and visualize their clusters.

In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information.

An intrusion detection network (IDN) is a collaborative IDS network intended to overcome this weakness by allowing IDS peers to share detection knowledge and experience, and hence improve the overall accuracy of intrusion assessment. In this work, we design an IDN system, called GUIDEX, using game-theoretic modeling and trust management for peers to collaborate truthfully and actively. We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner. Based on the duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium. Our numerical experiments and discrete event simulation demonstrate the convergence to the Nash equilibrium and the security features of GUIDEX against free riders, dishonest insiders and DoS attacks.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2012.121214,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354280,Intrusion detection systems;collaborative networks;game theory;incentive compatibility;network optimization;network security and economics,Communication networks;Computer crime;Computer security;Economics;Intrusion detection;Security;Telecommunication services,Internet;computer network security;game theory,DoS attacks;GUIDEX IDN system;IDS peers;Nash equilibrium;collaborative IDS network;detection knowledge;discrete event simulation;dishonest insiders;free riders;game-theoretic incentive-based mechanism;game-theoretic modeling;intrusion assessment;intrusion detection networks;intrusion detection systems;iterative algorithm;resource management component;security features;trust management,,3,,33,,,Dec-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Currently, packet analysis is provided by almost each ISP but it has a high impact in term of performance and energy consumption; this makes the choice of the optimal IDS strategy both a key and non-trivial issue. To this aim, IDS strategies have been deeply investigated in term of performance, while the assessment of the energy consumption is quite unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first attempt towards the assessment of the energy impact of security solutions.

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point.

It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches.

Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance.

Recent advances in scheduling theory show that it is possible to reduce the expected mean response time of a queuing system, simply by changing the order in which we schedule the requests according to the job size, which is so called size-based scheduling policy. In this paper, we start by an analysis of connection sojourn time distribution of network traffic. Based on this analysis, first we design a two level session table in order to avoid session table explosion. Then we propose a connection scheduling policy in stateful packet inspection systems called LASF (least attained sojourn first).

Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols.

As the idea of filtering the traffic at the entrance door, by using firewalls and the like, is not completely successful, the use of intrusion detection systems should be considered to increase the defense capacity of an information system. This paper presents a NeuroC4.5 based approach to network intrusion detection to detect anomalies in the computer networks. Decision tree is with good comprehensibility while neural network is with strong generalization ability. So, these merits are integrated into a novel decision tree algorithm NeuroC4.5. The NeuroC4.5 is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data. The generated rules are then used to detect network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing decision tree based approaches, the spawned rules are more effective because the generalization ability of NeuroC4.5 decision trees is better than that of C4.5 decision trees.

Di-Sec: A distributed security framework for heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Valero, M.; Sang Shin Jung; Uluagac, A.S.; Yingshu Li; Beyah, R.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Georgia State Univ., Atlanta, GA, USA","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,585,593,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are deployed for monitoring in a range of critical domains (e.g., health care, military, critical infrastructure). Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801,Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security,Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks,encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks,,6,,17,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Tampering with the kernel data is an attractive venue for rootkit writers since malicious modifications in the kernel are harder to identify compared to their user-level counterparts. So far however, the pattern followed for tampering is limited to hiding malicious objects in user-space. This involves manipulating a subset of kernel data structures that are related to intercepting user requests or affecting the user's view of the system. Hence, defense techniques are built around detecting such hiding behavior. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a new class of stealthy attacks that only exist in kernel space and do not employ any hiding techniques traditionally used by rootkits. These attacks are stealthy because the damage done to the system is not apparent to the user or intrusion detection systems installed on the system and are symbolic of a more systemic problem present throughout the kernel. Our goal in building these attack prototypes was to show that such attacks are not only realistic, but worse; they cannot be detected by the current generation of kernel integrity monitors, without prior knowledge of the attack signature.",1081-6011,0-7695-2848-1,,10.1109/SP.2007.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223229,,Computer architecture;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Detectors;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes,data integrity;data structures;invasive software;operating system kernels,attack signature;kernel code;kernel data structures;malicious modifications;stealthy attacks;systemic threats,,15,,18,,,20-23 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Unlike other API-hook-based solutions, which will not discover that system calls are actually invoked by malicious code in certain cases, AIFD works well in those cases. By it, programs protected will not yield control to the exploitation code, but rather enter a fail-safe state. In this paper, we present principle of buffer overflow attacks, implementation details of AIFD, and experimental results of both penetration resistance and the performance impact of this solution.",,978-1-4244-0973-0,978-1-4244-0973-0,10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370697,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370697,AIFD;API hook;Buffer overflow attack,Buffer overflow;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning;Operating systems;Protection;Runtime,application program interfaces;buffer storage;fingerprint identification;operating system kernels;program compilers;security of data,API invocation fingerprint detection;API-hook-based solutions;buffer overflow attack;operating system kernel;program compiler,,0,,19,,,19-22 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Comparison of Two Intrusion Detection Schemes for Sparsely Connected Ad Hoc Networks,"Chuah, M.; Yang, P.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Lehigh Univ., Bethlehem, PA","Military Communications Conference, 2006. MILCOM 2006. IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,7,"Several approaches have been proposed for intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks. Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks. Without the mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio with black hole attacks drops to 65.9%. With FBIDM, the achieved delivery ratio ranges from 82.9% (with a single ferry) to 91.9% (with four ferries) with black hole attacks",,1-4244-0617-X,1-4244-0618-8,10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302390,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086633,DSR;DoS resilience;disruption tolerant networkst;intrusion detection;routing;sparsely connected adhoc networks,Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data,FBIDM scheme;ferry-based intrusion detection-mitigation scheme;mobile ad hoc network;sparsely connected network,,3,,17,,,23-25 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Ultra-high throughput string matching for Deep Packet Inspection,"Kennedy, A.; Xiaojun Wang; Zhen Liu; Bin Liu","Sch. of Electron.

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.",1530-1591,978-1-4244-7054-9,,10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172,,Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput,field programmable gate arrays;string matching,Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching,,0,,18,,,8-12 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Security services are usually provided by implementing new security mechanisms that are explicitly tailored to mobile components. Unfortunately, developing sound, reliable security mechanisms is a non-trivial task, and a history of vulnerable and/or incomplete implementations of these mechanisms led to the idea that mobile code systems are inherently insecure, too complex, and very difficult to deploy. To overcome these problems, we developed a mobile code system that relies as much as possible on the security mechanisms already provided by the underlying operating system. By doing this, it is possible to develop, with reduced effort, security services that rely on well-known, well-understood, and well-tested security mechanisms.

It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases.

In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.",,978-1-4244-1432-1,978-1-4244-1433-8,10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468,,Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN,,,,9,,16,,,10-14 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time, it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as 1 and the other is marked as 0. During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.",1949-3053,,,10.1109/TSG.2013.2264537,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584806,Dynamic secret-based encryption;ZigBee;retransmission;security;smart grid;wireless communication,Encryption;Monitoring;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Zigbee,Zigbee;cryptography;power system security;smart power grids,ZigBee protocol;dynamic encryption key;dynamic secret;encryption scheme;power system;retransmission sequence;security problems;shared communication medium;smart grid wireless communication,,3,,29,,8/22/2013,May-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Network topology authentication, and hybrid key cryptography are the building blocks for this proposal: the former means that a cryptographic key can be generated if and only if the current network topology is compliant to the ldquoplanned network topologyrdquo, which acts as the authenticated reference; the latter means that the proposed scheme is a combination of features from symmetric (for the ciphering and authentication model) and asymmetric cryptography (for the key generation model). The proposal fits the security requirement of a cryptographic scheme for WSN in a limited computing resource. A deep quantitative security analysis has been carried out.

First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM.

One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature. Experimental result shows that our method allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack.

Thanks to the advances in smart phones and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies, e-invoices can be delivered via NFC-enabled smartpones, allowing consumers to examine the content immediately after transactions and to easily retrieve them later on.

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0.

MICRO-39. 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on",20061226,2006,,,123,134,"Current anomaly detection schemes focus on control flow monitoring. Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation.

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers.

However, existing flow-based solutions have serious limitations in detecting unknown attacks and efficiently identifying real attack flows buried in the background traffic. In addition, existing solutions also have difficulty to adapt to attack dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a flow-based DOS detection scheme based on Artificial Immune systems. We adopt a tree structure to store flow information such that we can effectively extract useful features from flow information for better detecting DoS attacks. We employ Neighborhood Negative Selection (NNS) as the detection algorithm to detect unknown DoS attacks, and identify attack flows from massive traffic. Because the strong tolerance of NNS, the proposed solution is able to quickly adapt attack dynamics. The experimental results show that this solution is able to effectively detect unknown DoS attack flows and identify attack flows from background traffic. Meanwhile, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that this system can extract flow features more effectively.",,978-1-4673-1855-6,,10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664254,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664254,Artificial immune;DoS attack;Flow;Intrusion detection,Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Data mining;Detectors;Feature extraction;IP networks;Protocols,Internet;artificial immune systems;computer network security;real-time systems;telecommunication traffic,DoS attack flows;DoS attacks;Internet;NNS;artificial immune systems;attack dynamics;background traffic;detection algorithm;flow information;flow-based DOS detection schemes;flow-based solutions;high-speed networks;neighborhood negative selection;payload-based approaches;payload-based solutions;real attack flows;tree structure,,0,,14,,,Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification.

The state-of-the-art approach for network monitoring and analysis involves storage and analysis of network flow statistic. However, this approach loses much valuable information within the Internet traffic. With the advancement of commodity hardware, in particular the volume of storage devices and the speed of interconnect technologies used in network adapter cards and multi-core processors, it is now possible to capture 10 Gbps and beyond real-time network traffic using a commodity computer, such as n2disk. Also with the advancement of distributed file system (such as Hadoop, ZFS, etc.) and open cloud computing platform (such as OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, etc.), it is practical to store such large volume of traffic data and fully in-depth analyse the inside communication within an acceptable latency. In this paper, based on wellknown TimeMachine, we present TIFAflow, the design and implementation of a novel system for archiving and querying network flows. Firstly, we enhance the traffic archiving system named TImemachine+FAstbit (TIFA) with flow granularity, i.e., supply the system with flow table and flow module. Secondly, based on real network traces, we conduct performance comparison experiments of TIFAflow with other implementations such as common database solution, TimeMachine and TIFA system.

In this proof-of-concept study, a new scan detection technique is demonstrated that also improves our understanding of Internet traffic. Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan.

SSA,"Fang Yu; Lakshman, T.V.; Motoyama, M.A.; Katz, R.H.",,"Architecture for networking and communications systems, 2005. ANCS 2005. Symposium on",20081117,2005,,,105,113,"New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multi-match packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with Geometric Intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet.",,978-1-59593-082-8,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675270,TCAM;energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification,Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Indexes;Matched filters;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand,computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;power aware computing;security of data;telecommunication network routing,geometric intersection-based solutions;intrusion detection systems;matching filters;memory efficient scheme;multimatch packet classification;network applications;packet-level accounting;parallel matching;power consumption;power efficient scheme;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memories,,0,,29,,,26-28 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets.

We proposed SFK-means approach which inherits the advantages of K-means, Fuzzy K-means and Swarm K- means, simultaneously we improve the deficiencies. The most advantages of our SFK-means algorithm are solving the local convergence problem in Fuzzy K- means and the sharp boundary problem in Swarm K- means.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees.

Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level.

To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography).

Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a content-less identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD<sup>2</sup>FAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.",,978-1-59593-580-9,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579526,DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions,Added delay;Automata;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Information security;Inspection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Permission;Throughput,computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;grammars;storage management,content addressed delayed input;content addressing;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;expression representation;memory access;network applications;network data streams;regular expression parsing;state traversal process;table compression,,15,2,34,,,3-5 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Our goal in this work is to improve the trustworthiness of a host and its system data. Specifically, we provide a new mechanism that ensures the correct origin or provenance of critical system information and prevents adversaries from utilizing host resources. We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic.

In this paper, we propose a framework of intrusion detection/recovery system (IDRS). This system is capable of detecting the intrusion on the file-level and recovering data on the block-level. Its advantages include that the file-level detection simplifies the implementation and the recovery based on the block-level can decrease the recovery time and raise the utilization ratio of storage devices. Again, considering that iSCSI has increasingly played an important role in network storage systems, we implement the IDRS prototype based on this promising protocol. The result of tests shows the extra storage overheads, arising from IDRS, are small (less than 10%).

To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform.

On the Effectiveness of Monitoring for Intrusion Detection in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Boppana, R.V.; Xu Su","Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.210,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919,Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.,Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement,Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration,,3,,32,,11/9/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a uncompromised router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment.

Behavior-Profile Clustering for False Alert Reduction in Anomaly Detection Sensors,"Frias-Martinez, V.; Stolfo, S.J.; Keromytis, A.D.","Comput. Sci.

Annual",20081222,2008,,,367,376,"Anomaly detection (AD) sensors compute behavior profiles to recognize malicious or anomalous activities. The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets.

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages.

The trust system evaluates the nodes' competence and reliability in relaying packets in terms of multi-dimensional trust values. The trust values are attached to the nodes' public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions. We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss of trust will result in loss of future earnings. Moreover, for the efficient implementation of the trust system, the trust values are computed by processing the payment receipts.

Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: application layer IDS (AIDS), transport layer IDS (TIDS), network layer IDS (NIDS) and link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type.

However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows.

We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector.

The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696,Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority,Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks,,,,0,,22,,,26-28 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Such attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software to override its program control-flow and consequently invoke system calls, causing out-of-process damage. Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.",1550-445X,978-1-4799-3629-8,,10.1109/AINA.2014.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655,Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security,Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology,filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic,NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection,,0,,19,,,13-16 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment.

The Ethernet switch or router with a network processor can be a solution for these requirements. Also, the Gigabit Ethernet switch is already being deployed in large numbers in both corporate and public data networks, and has begun to move Ethernet from the region of the local area network out to encompass the metro aria network. Especially, the support of the 10 Gb physical port is necessary for the gigabit network devices.

Most prevalent among them are spoof threats, in which one network device changes its network identifiers to that of another network device. One of the possible reasons of spoofing in wireless network is that per-frame source authentication is not provided. Full scale authentication can be provided, but it is not always desirable as it requires reliable key management. The attacker can further launch Denial of Service attacks by spoofing deauthentication/disassociation or power saving frames, can bypass the access control list or can falsely advertise services to wireless clients. This paper discusses some of the non cryptographic techniques to detect MAC spoofing along with their pros and cons and the network scenarios in which they can be used. Analysis of these techniques is done on data captured from live test bed. The information in this paper can help the wireless equipment manufacturers to implement intrusion detection systems capable of detecting MAC address spoofing efficiently with least number of false alarms.",1556-6463,978-1-4244-3805-1,,10.1109/ICON.2008.4772621,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772621,,Access control;Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Power system protection;Radio frequency;Testing;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks,access protocols;wireless LAN,MAC spoof detection;access control;denial of service attacks;full scale authentication;intrusion detection systems;network identifiers;non-cryptographic methods;per-frame source authentication;power saving frames;security threats;wireless LAN;wireless network,,3,,18,,,12-14 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Efficient Multimatch Packet Classification for Network Security Applications,"Fang Yu; Lakshman, T.V.; Motoyama, M.A.; Katz, R.H.","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20061002,2006,24,10,1805,1816,"New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multimatch packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2006.877134,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705613,Energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM),Associative memory;Costs;Counting circuits;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Multiuser detection;Payloads;Random access memory;US Department of Commerce,content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication security,SNORT filter set;SSA;TCAM lookup;multimatch packet classification;network security application;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memory,,11,,32,,,Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

Large enterprise networks, such as the network for a major university, are very inviting targets to hackers who are looking to exploit networks. Large enterprise networks may consist of many machines running numerous operating systems. These networks normally have enormous storage capabilities and high speed/high bandwidth connections to the Internet. Due to the requirements for academic freedom, system administrators are restricted in what requirements they can place on users on these networks. The high bandwidth usages on these networks make it very difficult to identify malicious traffic within the enterprise network. We propose that a Honeynet can be used to assist the system administrator in identifying malicious traffic on the enterprise network. By its very nature, a Honeynet has no production value and should not be generating or receiving any traffic. Thus, any traffic to or from the Honeynet is suspicious in nature.

Due to the hysteresis and incompleteness of the signature establishment as well as the inaccuracy of statistics probability model, the effectiveness of traditional signature-based and statistics-based anomaly detection methods are directly restricted. Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series. This method mines structural behavior patterns of the associated graph and detects anomaly traffic through data mining and entropy-based information theoretic techniques. Experiments on KDD Cup 99 dataset demonstrate that this method greatly simplify the process of anomaly detection, and effectively reduce dimensionality of high-dimensional data, and at the same time this method gets a good detection effect.",,,978-1-84919-729-8,10.1049/cp.2013.2470,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826019,Anomaly Classification;Anomaly Detection;Limited Penetrable Visibility Graph;Machine Learning,,computer network security;data mining;entropy;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic,FL-LPVG;anomaly behaviors;anomaly traffic detection;associated graph;big data processing;complex networks;data mining;entropy-based information theoretic techniques;flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph;high-dimensional data dimensionality reduction;network flow series;network traffic;network-based anomaly detection methods;signature establishment hysteresis;signature establishment incompleteness;signature-based anomaly detection methods;statistics probability model;statistics-based anomaly detection methods;structural behavior pattern mining,,0,,,,,22-24 Nov. 2013,,IET,IET Conference Publications,

TRR dynamically and randomly relocates a program's stack, heap, shared libraries, and parts of its runtime control data structures inside the application memory address space. Making a program's memory layout different each time it runs foils the attacker's assumptions about the memory layout of the vulnerable program and makes the determination of critical address values difficult if not impossible. TRR is implemented by changing the Linux dynamic program loader, hence it is transparent to applications. We demonstrate that TRR is effective in defeating real security attacks, including malloc-based heap overflow, integer overflow, and double-free attacks, for which effective prevention mechanisms are yet to emerge.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic.

Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method.

Machine learning techniques such as Decision trees have been applied to the field of intrusion detection. Machine learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and generate classifiers that are used to detect attacks on computer system. In general the input to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space, but not all features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Feature selection is a very important step in classification since the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features often degrade the performance of classification algorithms both in speed and accuracy. In this paper, we have considered three different approaches for feature selection, Chi square, Information Gain and ReliefF which is based on filter approach.

Clustering can be made effective in CEAACK MANETs by opting for a cluster head mechanism which ensures that control rests with a single powerful node within a cluster. This cluster head takes on the responsibility of routing the packets efficiently by coordinating with the base station. Cluster heads are also prone to malicious attacks and is affected more than a normal network. In this paper we try to incorporate a new approach in CEAACK MANETs by implementing a cryptographic technique to tackle the vulnerabilities of the network.

Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy.

Lightweight mobile core networks for machine type communications,"Taleb, T.; Ksentini, A.; Kobbane, A.","Aalto Univ., Espoo, Finland","Access, IEEE",20141003,2014,2,,1128,1137,"Machine type communications (MTCs) enable the communications of machines (devices) to machines over mobile networks. Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks.

CTCP: a transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture for network security,Fu-Hau Hsu; Tzi-cker Chiueh,"Dept. of Comput.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead.

A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack. This system is designed to be integrated into other detectors in order to mitigate false positive rates so that this enriches the chances of detecting zero-day worms and new attack exploits,,1-4244-0997-7,1-4244-0997-7,10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350764,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156646,,Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Phase detection;Phase measurement;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis,IDS;Mahalanobis distance;clustering phase;false alarm rate;incremental learning algorithm;network anomaly detection system;network traffic;statistical model;value-byte frequency,,0,,15,,,22-24 Feb. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography.

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues. We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that the resulting system outperforms a general-purpose operating system by an average of 22% for a real networking application.

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.",2168-2267,,,10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798,Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model,,Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines,GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers,,2,,60,,3/27/2013,Jan. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Eng., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","Global Telecommunications Conference, 2005. GLOBECOM '05. IEEE",20060123,2005,3,,6 pp.,,"Most Internet worms use random scanning. The distribution of vulnerable hosts on the Internet, however, is highly non-uniform over the IP-address space. This implies that random scanning wastes many scans on invulnerable addresses, and more virulent scanning schemes may take advantage of the non-uniformity of a vulnerable-host distribution. Questions then arise how attackers may make use of such information, and how virulent the resulting worm may be. These issues provide worst-case scenarios for defenders and best-case scenarios for attackers if the vulnerable-host distribution is available. This work develops such a scenario as the so-called importance scanning. Importance scanning results from importance sampling in statistics that scans IP-address space according to an empirical distribution of vulnerable hosts. An analytical model is developed to relate the infection rate of worms with the importance-scanning strategies. Experimental results based on parameters chosen from code red and slammer worms show that an importance-scanning worm can spread much faster than both a random-scanning worm and a routing worm.

Hence, the SDN architecture empowers networks to actively monitor traffic and diagnose threats to facilitates network forensics, security policy alteration, and security service insertion. The separation of the control and data planes, however, opens security challenges, such as man-in-the middle attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and saturation attacks.

Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams,"Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on",20100524,2010,,,1,8,"In this work we consider the problem of monitoring information streams for anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.",,978-1-4244-6533-0,,10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852,,Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks,entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN,IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic,,5,,22,,,19-23 April 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
SIMD parallelization of applications that traverse irregular data structures,"Ren, B.; Agrawal, G.; Larus, J.R.; Mytkowicz, T.; Poutanen, T.; Schulte, W.","Dept. of Comput.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.",,978-1-4673-5524-7,,10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989,Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD,Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation,data structures;optimisation;parallel programming,SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach,,1,,37,,,23-27 Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

A Memory Efficient Multiple Pattern Matching Architecture for Network Security,Tian Song; Wei Zhang; Dongsheng Wang; Yibo Xue,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters. A single architecture is memory efficient for large pattern set, and it is possible to support more than 10 M patterns with at most half amount of the memory utilization compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-2025-4,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.42,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509637,,Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching,cache storage;computer networks;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security,ACC algorithm;cached deterministic finite automate;computer network security;content inspection based application;memory efficient multiple pattern matching architecture;next-state addressing scheme,,21,3,23,,,13-18 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds.

Digital forensics is a branch of computer security that makes use of electronic evidence to build up a criminal case or for troubleshooting purposes. Advances have been made since the advent of Cloud computing in addressing issues that came with the Cloud including that of security. However, not all aspects of security are advancing. Developments in digital forensics still leave a lot to be desired in terms of standards and appropriate digital forensic tools that are applicable in the Cloud. To achieve that, standards as well as standard tools are required for successful evidence collection, preservation, analysis and conviction in case of a criminal case. This paper contributes towards addressing issues in digital forensics by presenting an algorithm that can be used in the evidence identification phase of a digital forensic process. Data in Cloud environments exist in the Internet or in networked environments and data is always accessed remotely. There is therefore at least one connection to a host that exists in a Cloud environment. In a case of a computer system that hosts a Cloud service, the number of connections from clients can be very large. In such a scenario it is very hard to identify an attacker from both active and recently disconnected connections to a host. This may require an investigator to probe all individual IP addresses connected to the host which can be time consuming and costly. There is therefore a need for a mechanism that can identify and rank remote hosts that are connected to a victim host and that may be associated with a malicious activity. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses probabilities to identify and rank suspicious remote hosts connected to a victim host. This algorithm helps minimize the effort required of investigators to probe each IP address that is connected to a victim as connected IP addresses will be prio- itized according to their rank.",,,,10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641044,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641044,Cloud Computing;Digital Forensic Processes;Digital Forensics;Intrusion Detection,Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Digital forensics;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model,cloud computing;digital forensics;probability,Internet;cloud computing;cloud environment;computer security;digital forensic investigation;digital forensic tools;electronic evidence;evidence identification phase;individual IP addresses;malicious activity;probability;remote host ranking;remote host selection;victim host,,0,,16,,,14-16 Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs.

IEEE International Conference on",20100208,2009,,,297,302,"As a comprehensive security system, researchers recently have turned to the human immune system as a very wealthy source of inspiration. DNA computation, evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, and artificial immune systems are some of the research interest which can be pointed out. By means of diverse kinds of cells, molecules, and mechanisms, the immune system efficiently protects the human body against different kinds of attacks. Many immune-inspired techniques have been developed with the aim to tackle different computing problems. Network security represents one of the most significant fields that the immune-inspired techniques have been applied to. Given that mobile ad hoc networks have a decentralized nature similar to the human immune system (HIS), immune-inspired security architecture is highly expected to come across different ad hoc security problems, one of which is the malicious node that can disrupt the routing process, masquerade as the legitimate nodes, and impersonate the trusted nodes.

Mobile ad hoc networks are gaining popularity because of the availability of low cost mobile devices and its ability to provide instant wireless networking capabilities. MANET is an infrastructure less network and there is no central administration. The open medium, wide distribution of nodes, changing topology and no centralized monitoring makes MANETs vulnerable to malicious attackers. For these types of networks, security is the most essential service to provide protection and prevent malicious attacks occurring in the mobile nodes. Attackers can easily compromise MANETs by inserting malicious or non cooperative nodes into the network. To compensate MANET from these malicious activities in this paper, it is proposed a new intrusion detection & prevention algorithm named as Packet Dropping detection Algorithm (PDA). MANETs depends on the cooperation of nodes in the network for the forwarding of packets to the destination. The Cooperation requires detecting routes on the neighbor nodes. The cooperative node having malicious activity by the attacker may not forward or drops the packets, partially or fully.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

Presently, SIP is widely used with Internet messaging, games and with VoIP (voice over IP) due to advantages such as its simplicity, flexibility and variety of protocols. However, SIP is associated with many types of security issues and requires a countermeasure device against call-disturbance attacks that can cause a great amount of inconvenience to users. Therefore, this study analyses SIP De- registration and call-disruption attacks and proposes a means of detecting these attacks. Attack detection is accomplished through a comparison of the messages last sent by the user and those that are considered to be an attack based on a Retransmission mechanism.

To mitigate extra load caused by renewing of certificates, we have identified critical factors affecting it and designed the computation formula for optimal amount of cross certificates issued by trusted authority. To further improve the service reachablity in highly mobile networks in earlier stages of PKI deployment, we have designed the Cluster Glue.

However, packet-sampling mechanisms must be robust to adversarial hosts that craft packet streams that are disproportionately selected by a packet sampler. For example, a botnet flooding a network with packets in a denial-of-service attack, or a greedy customer trying to avoid being billed for network utilization, each have a strong incentive to craft packet streams that evade selection by the packet sampler. In this paper, we focus on securing the passive packet sampling mechanisms recommended by PSAMP (the IETF Packet Sampling working group [1]) against adversarial hosts. We show that (1) some of the packet sampling techniques suggested in current drafts of the PSAMP charter have security vulnerabilities, (2) secure uncoordinated sampling can be achieved using random sampling with a cryptographic random number generator, and (3) secure coordinated sampling requires a cryptographic pseudorandom function, keyed with a secret key that should be changed each time the sampler leaks information to the hosts.",,978-1-4244-2483-2,,10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567339,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567339,,Cryptography;Data engineering;Data security;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;cryptography;random processes;sampling methods;telecommunication traffic,Internet measurement application;cryptographic pseudorandom function;cryptographic random number generator;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end data-path quality;intrusion detection;packet sampling;security vulnerability;telecommunication traffic,,0,3,9,,,April 30 2007-May 2 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This complexity made the desire for more sophisticated tools to watch and troubleshoot network traffic. Network traffic monitoring is can be quite a network diagnostic tool that monitors local area networks and provides a graphical display of network statistics. While collecting information through the network's data stream, network monitor displays the source address of the computer that sent a frame onto the network, the destination address of the computer that received the frame and also the protocols employed to send the frame. The procedure through which network monitor collects this information is known as Capturing. Automatically, the network monitor gathers statistics on all of the frames it detects on the network into a capture buffer that is a reserved storage area in memory.

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406,amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network,Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services,,,,4,,,,,Feb. 2013,,TUP,TUP Journals & Magazines,

Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems.

Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node.

Measuring Network-Aware Worm Spreading Ability,Zesheng Chen; Chuanyi Ji,"Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta",INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20070529,2007,,,116,124,"This work investigates three aspects: (a) a network vulnerability as the non-uniform vulnerable-host distribution, (b) threats, i.e., intelligent worms that exploit such a vulnerability, and (c) defense, i.e., challenges for fighting the threats. We first study five data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new metric, referred to as the non-uniformity factor, which quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the Renyi information entropy and better characterizes the non-uniformity of a distribution than the Shannon entropy. We then analytically and empirically measure the infection rate and the propagation speed of network-aware worms. We show that a representative network-aware worm can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a non-uniformity factor when compared to a random-scanning worm at the early stage of worm propagation. This implies that when a worm exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a network-wide vulnerability, the Internet can be infected much more rapidly. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network-aware worms. Our results demonstrate that counteracting network-aware worms is a significant challenge for the strategies that include host-based defense and IPv6.",0743-166X,1-4244-1047-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2007.22,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215604,,Communications Society;Computer networks;Computer worms;Distributed computing;Electric variables measurement;IP networks;Information entropy;Intelligent networks;Internet;Velocity measurement,Internet;entropy,Renyi information entropy;Shannon entropy;network vulnerability;network-aware worm spreading ability;vulnerable-host distribution,,17,,32,,,6-12 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Scalable Lookahead Regular Expression Detection System for Deep Packet Inspection,"Bando, M.; Artan, N.S.; Chao, H.J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Polytech. Inst. of New York Univ., Brooklyn, NY, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20120612,2012,20,3,699,714,"Regular expressions (RegExes) are widely used, yet their inherent complexity often limits the total number of RegExes that can be detected using a single chip for a reasonable throughput. This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes.

Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, a real intrusion tolerant database system ITDB is implemented to validate the proposed state-space models.

Recent studies show that current computer architecture advances and CPU performance improvements have limited impact on network protocol processing performance. Some studies find that in real SMT processor like Intel Xeon processor with hyper-threadings, the sharing resources (like cache) contention between threads can hurt the processing performance of network applications like servers or IDS. How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads. We find (1) the load/store units can be the bottleneck of protocol processing; and (2) in connection establishing phase of TCP processing, cache contention between threads is more aggressive than any other phase.

This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits.

Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.",1063-8210,,,10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396,Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection,Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip,authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching,antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor,,0,,25,,3/28/2011,May-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

A new passive approach that takes advantage of the first frame that the RAP sends (i.e, Beacon Frame (BF)) when it is planted in the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is proposed. We apply the proposed fingerprint to detect RAPs to evaluate the fingerprint effectiveness. The proposed framework examines every beacon frame size, and compares it with a threshold value. The technique is implemented on a commercially available Wireless Network Interface Controller (WNIC) to evaluate its accuracy.

As the IANA pool of IPv4 addresses has run out, IPv6 will become increasingly important. Although the IPv6 protocol stack presents considerable advantages compared with the IPv4 protocol stack, IP source address spoofing is still exploited in IPv6 to initiate malicious attacks. Some techniques are proposed and deployed to implement source address validation at fine granularity. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of fine granularity IP source address validation, e.g. whether filtering technology is deployed to prevent hosts from using forged IP address. We develop a detection tool with controlled spoofing ability which can infer whether the function of filtering spoofing address packets is enabled. We run this tool in 12 famous universities in China and collect the testing data. We gather a total of 41373 probes from 324 clients, and each probe includes sending at least 5 packets with the same spoofing source address to the control server. Results reveal that, 77.02% of the spoofing probes are completely filtered, 0.29% of the spoofing probes are partly filtered and the rest spoofing probes are not filtered at all. Overall, this illustrates that techniques of source address validation have been widely deployed in campus networks.

To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures.

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.",1930-529X,1-4244-0356-1,1-4244-0357-X,10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932,,Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;invasive software,Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system,,0,,11,,,Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This raises many questions about the appropriate infrastructure, processes, and strategy for enacting detection and response to intrusion in a Cloud environment. This article discusses the security and the visibility issues of an inter-VM traffic and solutions for it within a Cloud environment context, by proposing an approach relying on distributed intrusion detection technique and packet inspection.",,978-1-4673-5230-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516788,,,cloud computing;grid computing;security of data;virtual machines,CC;cloud computing;cloud environment;distributed computing;distributed intrusion detection technique;grid computing;inter-VM packet inspection;inter-VM traffic;interconnection points;virtual machines,,1,,12,,,12-14 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The wide deployment and use of WLANs has made it imperative for service providers to provide secure access to network for valid users and able to suitably detect, identify and terminate the access for invalid users. While most of the wired network cabling is located inside buildings, already secured from the use of un-authorized physical access through the use of keys, badge access and so forth. In contrast, wireless APs may be accessed from the premises or even slightly away from premises where they are deployed, if the signal is detectable (for instance, from parking lots or nearby buildings). Thus wireless networks require a very secure access to APs and the ability to isolate and terminate any potential threat to the network.

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters.

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected.

Based on the investigation of correlativity changes of monitored network features during flooding attacks, this paper employs statistical covariance matrices to build a norm profile of normal activities in information systems and directly utilizes the changes of covariance matrices to detect various flooding attacks. The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

Data mining based anomaly traffic detection is implemented at the host; whereas resource management is responsible for the allocation of network resources to the applications. Based on the deviation of the monitored traffic to the normal traffic, differentiated resources are allocated to the traffic. When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS.

Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly.

Pattern matching systems are not able to cope with high bandwidth (10 Gbps +) when analyzing the whole payload. Furthermore, new attack schemes arise by increasingly complex software and systems. New approaches like network behavior analyses (NBA) systems show promise for being able to cope with the new threats. These systems evaluate statistical flow data generated from the traffic of the monitored network. While originally designed for optimising traffic handling and accounting in the network, flow data appeared to be powerful for intrusion detection. NBA Systems based on machine learning techniques are able to evaluate these data and to recognize anomalies in the network. However, these systems suffer from a long-lasting learning phase and are susceptible to manipulations during that time.

It has been estimated that 40% of unplanned system downtime is due to software application failures. This paper describes a project to demonstrate survivability at the application layer. The goal is to replace a lost essential service by another service that supports mission fulfillment in a different but equivalent way. Application-level survivability, the ability to reconfigure an application to transparently maintain services when part of a system becomes unavailable, is the most flexible and comprehensive approach to supporting mission fulfillment since it can provide assurance over all lower layers within a networked system. We have developed resumable FTP, an application based on RFC 959, which has the ability to resume the download of a file after the download has been interrupted by users or by lower layers (loss of connection). FTP continues to be the most common method for bulk data transfer across networks and as high-performance network infrastructures have become established, default implementations of FTP have not kept pace.

Recent malware are not only becoming more sophisticated, but have also demonstrated a trend to make use of components, which can easily be distributed through the Internet to develop newer and better malware. As a result, the key problem facing Cloud security is to cope with identifying diverse sets of malware. This paper presents a method of detecting malware by identifying the symptoms of malicious behaviour as opposed to looking for the malware itself. This can be compared to the use of symptoms in human pathology, in which study of symptoms direct physicians to diagnosis of a disease or possible causes of illnesses. The main advantage of shifting the attention to the symptoms is that a wide range of malicious behaviour can result in the same set of symptoms. We propose the creation of Forensic Virtual Machines (FVM), which are mini Virtual Machines (VM) that can monitor other VMs to discover the symptoms. In this paper, we shall present a framework to support the FVMs so that they collaborate with each other in identifying symptoms by exchanging messages via secure channels. The FVMs report to a Command & Control module that collects and correlates the information so that suitable remedial actions can take place in real-time. The Command & Control can be compared to the physician who infers possibility of an illness from the occurring symptoms.

In this paper we proposed a change-point detection method to prevent denial-of-service attacks on VoIP systems based on session initiation protocol (SIP) protocol behavior analysis.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.",,978-1-4577-0025-5,,10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964,WSN security;directional antennas;recovery;secure routing,Computer crime;Directional antennas;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks,computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks,decision-making;directional antennas;mission-critical areas;network availability;network reliability;ns-2;persistent adversaries;security;wireless sensor networks,,2,,21,,,8-11 May 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications.

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions.

There are more nodes, the traffic has increased, and there are frequent requests that imply modifications to the underlying infrastructure. Some examples of these requirements are cloud computing, virtualized environments, and data centers. SDN has been developed to address some of these issues. By separating control and data planes, SDN enables the programming of the control plane and the dynamic reconfiguration of the data plane thus making it possible to automatize some tasks. SDN makes it possible to dynamically reconfigure a network as a response to a security event. This work studies the advantages and disadvantages of the platform for programming a network to react to security events. The number of security events that may happen in a network is considerable, therefore, we defined an architecture that may be used in different cases and implemented it to evaluate the behavior for two types of events: DoS attacks and intrusions.

However, in recent research, most actions in OSD remain the passive way, because of the request-driven model. As partial storage management functions are offloaded to OSD, the construction of an intelligent OSD has caught the fancy of most researchers. In this paper, we propose a novel autonomous intelligent OSD Cluster (iOSDC). In iOSDC, every OSD is intelligent, called intelligent OSD (iOSD) and all the objects are intelligent, called intelligent OBJECT (iOBJECT). Methods, rules, trigger and feed back mechanism are introduced into object defined in OSD-2 draft, so an object is comprised of data, attributes, methods, rules, trigger and feedback mechanism. After the relationship among these six components is built up, the object is no longer passive, but active. Furthermore, some specific objects are introduced into OSDs, these specific objects can enhance the intelligence of OSD. Collaboration of all the iOSDs gives birth to the intelligent OSD Cluster.

As Internet telephony becomes more and more popular, attackers will attempt to exhaustively test implementations' robustness, transmitting various types of malformed messages to them. Since it is almost infeasible to avoid or predict every potential error caused during the developing process of these subsystems, it is necessary to specify an appropriate and robust, from the security point of view, framework that will facilitate the successful detection and handling of any kind of malformed messages aiming to destruct the provided service.

In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise classifiers' outputs in order to fit the expert knowledge. Experimental studies on intrusion detection and alert correlation problems show that our approach improves the performances on different benchmarks.",1082-3409,978-1-4799-0227-9,,10.1109/ICTAI.2012.68,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6495080,Decision trees;alert correlation;expert knowledge;intrusion detection,Bayes methods;Context;Correlation;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution,decision trees;pattern classification;security of data;statistical distributions,alert correlation;classification problem;decision tree classifier;expert knowledge;intrusion detection;probability distribution;spam filtering,,0,,32,,,7-9 Nov. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This problem is especially challenging in the world of network intrusion detection. In this realm, we must not only deal with sifting through vast amounts of data, but we must also do it in a timely manner even when at times we are not sure what exactly it is we are trying to find. In the grander scheme of our work we intend to demonstrate that several different data mining algorithms reporting to an overarching layer will yield more accurate results than anyone data mining application (or algorithm) acting on its own. The system will operate in the domain of offline network and computer forensic data mining, under the guidance of a hybrid intelligence/multi-agent, systems based, for interpretation and interpolation of the findings. Toward that end, in this paper we build upon earlier work, undertaking the steps required for generating and preparing suitably minable data. Specifically, we are concerned with extracting as much useful data as possible out of a PCAP (Packet capture) for importing into Weka. While a PCAP may have thousands of field/value pairs, Wireshark and tshark's csv (comma separated value) output module only renders a small percentage of these fields and their values by default. We introduce a tool of our own making which enumerates every field (with or without a value) in any PCAP and generates an ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format - Weka default).

That is, if a firewall prevents outside IP addresses from sending packets to an internal protected machine that is only accessible on the local network, our technique can still find the machine. We employ a novel TCP/IP side channel technique to achieve this. The technique uses side channels in zombie machines to learn information about the network from the perspective of a zombie. Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans. This paper addresses two key questions about our technique: how many machines are there on the Internet that are hidden behind firewalls, and how common is ingress filtering that prevents our scan by not allowing spoofed IP packets into the network. We answer both of these questions, respectively, by finding 1,296 hidden machines and measuring that only 23.9% of our candidate zombie machines are on networks that perform ingress filtering.",,,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218441,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218441,,IP networks;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Ports (Computers);Probes;Size measurement,IP networks;Internet;firewalls,IP addresses;IP identification;Internet measurement technique;TCP/IP side channel technique;firewalls;hidden machines;idle scans;original SYN;zombie machines,,0,,33,,,April 26 2015-May 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Traffic flow management in next generation service provider networks  Are we there yet?,"Goss, R.; Botha, R.","Inst. for ICT Advancement, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ., Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Information Security South Africa (ISSA), 2011",20110926,2011,,,1,6,"For years a number of savvy Internet users have avoided firewalls and traffic engineering measures by directing traffic through ports seemingly unrelated to the application. These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as safe or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network.

The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms.

A lightweight hybrid security framework for wireless sensor networks,"Sedjelmaci, H.; Senouci, S.M.","DRIVE Lab., Univ. of Bourgogne, Nevers, France","Communications (ICC), 2014 IEEE International Conference on",20140828,2014,,,3636,3641,"On the one hand, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have shown their ability to detect internal and external attacks with a high accuracy. On the other hand, cryptography techniques have proved their ability to assure the privacy of communication, i.e. data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.",,,,10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886,Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks,Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks,cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks,,0,,19,,,10-14 June 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Spatial-Temporal Characteristics of Internet Malicious Sources,"Zesheng Chen; Chuanyi Ji; Barford, P.","Florida Int. Univ., Miami",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"This paper presents a large scale longitudinal study of the spatial and temporal features of malicious source addresses. The basis of our study is a 402-day trace of over 7 billion Internet intrusion attempts provided by DShield.org, which includes 160 million unique source addresses. Specifically, we focus on spatial distributions and temporal characteristics of malicious sources. First, we find that one out of 27 hosts is potentially a scanning source among 2<sup>32</sup> IPv4 addresses. We then show that malicious sources have a persistent, non-uniform spatial distribution. That is, more than 80% of the sources send packets from the same 20% of the IPv4 address space over time. We also find that 7.3% of malicious source addresses are unroutable, and that some source addresses are correlated. Next, we show that most sources have a short lifetime. 57.9 % of the source addresses appear only once in the trace, and 90% of source addresses appear less than 5 times.

Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (dynamic taint analysis detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses (i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data.",,978-0-7695-3185-4,978-0-7695-3185-4,10.1109/WAIM.2008.60,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597071,,Costs;Data security;Detectors;Information analysis;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual machining;Viruses (medical),computer viruses;program diagnostics;virtual machines,attack recognition;computer systems;data security;defense systems;diagnostic code;dynamic taint analysis detector;information flow security detection;information infection;information leakage;information protection;information security;log recording;malicious access;network access;network intrusion detection;state control;virtual machines;virus vulnerability,,0,,28,,,20-22 July 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

DepCos-RELCOMEX '06. International Conference on",20061211,2006,,,135,142,"Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) have become widely recognized as a powerful tool and an important element of IT security safeguards. Essential to every network intrusion prevention system is the ability to search through packets and identify patterns that match known attacks. Resource- and time-efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at the line rate. Recently these systems have become a target of attacks - the example is the infamous Witty worm. The devices which use algorithms with low worst-case performance could be a target of algorithmic complexity attacks. For example, poorly prepared hash tables can degenerate to linked lists with carefully chosen input. An attacker can effectively compute an input data that will diminish the device throughput. This can lead to denial of service attacks, which are very dangerous for networks and computational environments. In this article new hardware implementation architecture of the Karp-Rabin algorithm was introduced. The result is a software, which generates a pattern matching module that could be easily used to create intrusion prevention systems implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The prepared module matches the subset of the Snort IPS signatures achieving throughput of over 2 Gbps and have the worst-case performance similar to the best-case one.

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic.

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.",,,,10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947,Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis,Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines,Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines,Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine,,0,,21,,,24-26 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming.

CARE: Enhancing Denial-of-Service Resilience in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Ruiliang Chen; Jung-Min Park; Snow, M.","Bradley Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Virginia Polytech. Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, VA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2006. ICCCN 2006. Proceedings.15th International Conference on",20070122,2006,,,5,10,"This paper proposes an attack-resilient routing architecture, called cross-layer active re-routing (CARE), for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and dysfunctional network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.",1095-2055,1-4244-0572-6,,10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617,,Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing,attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures,,0,,12,,,9-11 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall network behavior of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored.

Parsing application layer protocol with commodity hardware for SDN,Hao Li; Chengchen Hu; Junkai Hong; Xiyu Chen; Yuming Jiang,"Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an, China","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2015 ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20150521,2015,,,51,61,"The de facto implementation of Software Defined Networking (SDN), i.e., OpenFlow, only parses L2-L4 headers, which limits the use of SDN to employ control intelligence in application layer. In this paper, we advocate content parsing to empower SDN with finer grained control ability over traffic. Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols.

DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability.

Instead of being extracted from the transient part, the signal fingerprint is computed on a part of the signal related to the transmission of a definite sequence of bits.

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering.

Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated.

Detecting Malicious Javascript in PDF through Document Instrumentation,"Daiping Liu; Haining Wang; Stavrou, A.",,"Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on",20140922,2014,,,100,111,"An emerging threat vector, embedded malware inside popular document formats, has become rampant since 2008. Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

Nodes can change position quite frequently, which mean the mobility of the network. For quick data transmission, we need a routing protocol that adapts to topology changes. For our convenience, we have proposed a fast and secure protocol which is proactive and reactive in nature. In proactive protocol, routing table updates takes place when the topology changes. In routers that use dynamic routing protocols, it is important to have fast convergence because routers could make incorrect forwarding decisions until the network has fully converged. In proactive protocol, when a new node is added in the network it takes some time to converge during that time if we want to send data to destination through that new node immediately, it takes some time to converge and then it will transmit the data. To avoid this problem we are going to use reactive protocol instead of proactive in that time that is until network converge. In proactive protocol structure, we reduced the packet size and contains only limited field. By this, the total bit size gets reduced. We propose this mechanism to avoid waiting time and to transmit data as early as possible.

Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, as long as the system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0.1 error/day during a 1-year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, 2 machines (on the average) will experience security violations.

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels.

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier.

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM.

The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model.

Sleep-based Topology Control for Wakeup Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Yuanyuan Zhou; Medidi, M.","Washington State Univ., Pullman","Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2007. SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,304,313,"Wireless sensor network applications require both energy-efficiency and low latency for reporting urgent but rare events. Various wakeup scheduling schemes have been proposed to save energy by employing duty cycles and to reduce end-to-end delay by synchronizing nodes' wakeup times and shortening setup latencies. Most sensor applications incur a predominant convergecast traffic pattern in which several close-by sensor nodes simultaneously send reports to the base station, which generates spatially-correlated contention. This contention, specific to sensor networks, can significantly prolong delay, degrade throughput, and impair energy-efficiency. However, most wakeup scheduling and MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks did not address this contention and can be adversely affected. We propose a distributed topology control technique to schedule nodes' wakeup time slots, and design a MAC protocol to benefit from this topology control for improving energy-efficiency and delay, and efficiently handling spatially-correlated contention. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our topology control and MAC can either reduce the end- to-end delay by roughly half or extend the network lifetime by three times, when compared against the nearest competing approach, and achieves twice the throughput under spatially-correlated contention.",,1-4244-1268-4,1-4244-1268-4,10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292842,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292842,,Base stations;Degradation;Delay;Distributed control;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;wireless sensor networks,MAC protocol;distributed topology control;end- to-end delay;sleep-based topology control;wakeup scheduling;wireless sensor networks,,7,,28,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Port-based traffic verification as a paradigm for anomaly detection,"Panchamukhi, V.; Murthy, H.A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Indian Inst. of Technol. Madras, Chennai, India","Communications (NCC), 2012 National Conference on",20120403,2012,,,1,5,An anomaly is an activity that deviates from the wellknown behaviour of the system. Anomaly detection in networks is of interest from two perspectives: an organization's perspective and an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) perspective. Protection of its computer network infrastructure is an important task for all organizations. Organizations desire that their networks are robust and resilient to any kind of attack. Anomaly detection forms an important part of this network resiliency. Also the ISPs want to maximize the utilization of their resources. Hence an ISP would be interested to know any resource failure immediately so as to correct the problem. ISPs would also be interested in safeguarding their network from malicious activities. We describe here a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based traffic verification system as a paradigm for network anomaly detection. The traffic characteristics aggregated over a period of time is given to the model to verify the validity of the traffic. If the traffic does not obey the model then we raise an alarm flagging it as an anomaly.

Fast Algorithms for Multi-stream Content Detection,Yuping Huang; Sanfeng Chen,"Dept. of Aeronaut. & Mech. Eng., NanChang Hangkong Univ., Nanchang, China","Electronic Commerce and Security, 2009.

Second International Symposium on",20091023,2009,2,,34,38,"High-speed packet content inspection and filtering devices rely on a fast multi-pattern matching algorithm which is used to detect predefined keywords or signatures in the packets. In TCP, a communication data stream is split into packets. Therefore, a target pattern may span multiple packets. Such fragmented pattern cannot be discovered by a per-packet scan. This is a serious problem in applications such as NIDS that require a complete scan. To avoid the problem, it is necessary to scan TCP streams. Stream-level parallelism is not a substantial solution because bandwidth depends on the number of active TCP streams. To scan each stream separately using one matching unit, the match states must be swapped appropriately. Another problem is, as parts of network infrastructure, the inspection units should support the function of QoS. In this paper, we proposed a multi-pattern matching automaton DSC-AC for high speed multi-stream packet scanning. We given out the construction of DSC-AC and optimized it with optimal and two binary searching tree and bit-map AC. Analysis and test showed that the optimized DSC-AC is capable of lightweight switching , enables a little state saving between streams and support the Diff-Serv Qos model.

We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism.

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor.

The proposal is specified as the IEEE 802.11s amendment. Although the IEEE802.11s amendment is still a draft, some implementations based on it may already be found. The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism.

Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, and significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.",,978-1-4244-0974-7,978-1-4244-0975-4,10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550349,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550349,,Bandwidth;Communication system security;Computer crime;Filtering;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic,,,,3,,21,,,17-21 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The increase in transmission of highly sensitive data and challenges of data protection and of privacy, data loss prevention has major significant implications for systems engineering, systems integration, and systems analysis, design and validation. Furthermore, the design and development of complex integrated systems engineering and network systems lack effective transparency, auditability, validation and implementation of adequate security measures for transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks using third party and outsourced networks and the Internet and global privacy regulatory requirements for such data transfer across international borders.

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers.

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators.

These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research.

In addition, new history based routing schemes e.g. Prophet have been proposed because traditional adhoc routing schemes do not work well in sparse ad hoc networks.

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits.

A distributed intrusion detection approach based on timed automata is given. A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then the timed automata is constructed by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of dynamic source routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify the behaviour of every nodes by timed automata, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data.

In particular, this work investigates three aspects: 1) a <i>network</i> <i>vulnerability</i> as the nonuniform vulnerable-host distribution, 2) <i>threats</i>, i.e., intelligent malwares that exploit such a vulnerability, and 3) <i>defense</i>, i.e., challenges for fighting the threats. We first study five large data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new metric, referred to as the <i>nonuniformity</i> <i>factor</i>, that quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the Renyi information entropy that unifies the nonuniformity of a vulnerable-host distribution with different malware-scanning methods. Next, we draw a relationship between Renyi entropies and randomized epidemic scanning algorithms. We find that the infection rates of malware-scanning methods are characterized by the Renyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a nonunform vulnerable-host distribution extracted by a randomized scanning algorithm. Meanwhile, we show that a representative network-aware malware can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a nonuniformity factor when compared to a random-scanning malware at an early stage of malware propagation. This quantifies that how much more rapidly the Internet can be infected at the early stage when a malware exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a network-wide vulnerability. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network-aware malwares.

Enhanced side-channel analysis method to detect hardware virtualization based rootkits,"Kyte, I.; Zavarsky, P.; Lindskog, D.; Ruhl, R.","Wurldtech Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Internet Security (WorldCIS), 2012 World Congress on",20120823,2012,,,192,201,"This paper describes a method of detecting hardware virtualization based rootkits by performance benchmarking by detecting performance degradation caused by the hardware virtualization itself. The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence.

To the outside, all ports and all IP addresses appear open in an OpenFire network. OpenFire uses the honeypot concept in its design. However, unlike traditional honeypots, OpenFire attempts to present additional false targets by making it appear to an attacker that all ports, including unused ones, and all unused IP addresses of an organization are open, with the thesis that this will help divert attacks from real services to false services. In our experiments, we defined an attack to be snorts priority 1 alert.

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system.

Enhancing the Reliability and Security of the Information Infrastructure Used to Manage the Power System,"Cleveland, Frances","IEEE Member, PES-PSCC","Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2007. IEEE",20070723,2007,,,1,8,"In the power industry, the focus has been almost exclusively on implementing equipment that can keep the power system reliable. Until recently, communications and information flows have been considered of peripheral importance. However, increasingly the information infrastructure that supports the monitoring and control of the power system has come to be critical to the reliability of the power system. Communication protocols are one of the most critical parts of power system operations, responsible for retrieving information from field equipment and, vice versa, for sending control commands. Despite their key function, to-date these communication protocols have rarely incorporated any security measures, including security against inadvertent errors, power system equipment malfunctions, communications equipment failures, or deliberate sabotage. Since these protocols were very specialized, security by obscurity has been the primary approach. However, security by obscurity is no longer a valid concept. In particular, the electricity market is pressuring market participants to gain any edge they can. A tiny amount of information can turn a losing bid into a winning bid - or withholding that information from your competitor can make their winning bid into a losing bid. And the desire to disrupt power system operations can stem from careless mistakes, to simple teenager bravado, to competitive game-playing in the electrical marketplace, and even to actual terrorism. As the power industry relies increasingly on information to operate the power system, two infrastructures must now be managed: not only the power system infrastructure, but also the information infrastructure. The management of the power system infrastructure has become reliant on the information infrastructure as automation continues to replace manual operations, as market forces demand more accurate and timely information, and as the power system equipment ages. Therefore, the reliability of the power sys- - tem is increasingly affected by any problems that the information infrastructure might suffer.

Unlike many existing solutions, TUF does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes an approach that is fundamentally more general. TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route.

This problem can be alleviated by separating the methodologies for network monitoring and for subsequent data analysis.

Third International Conference on",20090821,2009,,,191,196,"Sleep deprivation attacks are still an unsolved but critical problem in sensor networks. They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks. This paper proposes a secure wake up scheme that activates a sensor node by a secure wake up radio from a sleep state only if messages from an authenticated and legitimate node are pending. A lightweight security verification scheme is used that can easily be performed without requiring the node to change to active state.",,978-0-7695-3668-2,,10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.36,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211020,security;wake-up radio;wireless sensor network,Batteries;Communication standards;Communication switching;Cryptography;Protection;Security;Sleep;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks,energy conservation;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks,IEEE 802.15.4;battery powered sensor node;energy saving sleep state;frame cryptographic protection;lightweight security verification scheme;personal area networks;secure wake up scheme;sleep deprivation attack;wireless sensor network,,5,,16,,,18-23 June 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
An analysis of ASMA performances against packet dropping attacks in dense networks,"Toubiana, V.; Labiod, H.; Reynaud, Laurent; Gourhant, Y.","GET/ENST/INFRES Dept., LTCI-UMR 5141 CNRS, Paris","Computers and Communications, 2008.

However, collaboration of intermediate nodes is not guaranteed and non-collaborative nodes may drop packets they are asked to forward. Such behaviour, known as packet dropping, results of nodespsila selfishness or maliciousness and has dramatic effects on networks performances. Most of proposed solutions to counter packet dropping are either based on trust management or multipath routing, but no solution combines both trust management and multipath routing. Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a security framework which adapts security to the application requirements; evaluates trustworthy relationship based on localized trust model and efficiently combines multipath routing into trust management. In this paper we study ASMA performance against the most classical and simple packet dropping attack: Black Hole attack. Aiming to evaluate ASMA in dense networks, we use a realistic scenario representing a subway environment which brings interesting features and may be a prolific context for MANET application development. Through simulations we compare the performances of DSR and ASMA associated to DSR in attacked pure MANETs.

This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it.

Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection,Jiang Ming; Haibin Zhang; Debin Gao,"Coll. of Inf.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable.

Existing tools or techniques are quite limited. For instance, system events tracking lacks completeness of intrusion propagation, while dynamic taint tracking is not feasible to be deployed due to significant runtime overhead. Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the has-been-infected execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis.

An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers,"Danhua Guo; Bhuyan, L.N.; Bin Liu","Microsoft Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20121011,2012,20,5,1426,1439,"L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571,Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading,Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers,Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures,AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring,,1,,40,,12/12/2011,Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs.

According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not.

Therefore, to accomplish its function, an IDS should have some mechanism to guarantee uninterrupted detection service even in the face of IDS component failures due to attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion-tolerant mechanism for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) that employ multiple independent components. The mechanism monitors the detection units and the hosts on which the units reside and enables the IDS to survive component failure due to intrusions. As soon as a failed IDS component is discovered, a copy of the component is installed to replace it and the detection service continues.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set.

We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks.

Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts.

Hyperthreats: Hypercall-based DoS attacks,"Shropshire, J.","CIS, Univ. of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA",SoutheastCon 2015,20150625,2015,,,1,7,"The cloud offers a new environment for achieving Denial of Service (DoS) conditions on targeted infrastructure. Once confined to the network, they are now conducted over the hypercall interface. These attacks are initiated by malicious, unprivileged guests with a goal of incapacitating hosting hypervisors. Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls. The assumption is that exploits will be manifested as previously-unobserved sequences of hypercalls.

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET.

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives.

Every node including the cluster heads and sensor node authenticates its neighbor nodes with the initial key. Then every node establishes pair wise key with each of its neighbor node to ensure transmission secrecy. The pair wise keys are updated between node and its neighbors within a random interval time, which is triggered by the base station.

Dataflow anomaly detection,"Bhatkar, S.; Chaturvedi, A.; Sekar, R.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Stony Brook Univ., NY","Security and Privacy, 2006 IEEE Symposium on",20060619,2006,,,15 pp.,62,"Beginning with the work of Forrest et al, several researchers have developed intrusion detection techniques based on modeling program behaviors in terms of system calls. A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model.

The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists.

This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns.

It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality.

TERP: A Trust and Energy Aware Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Network,"Ahmed, A.; Abu Bakar, K.; Channa, M.I.; Haseeb, K.; Khan, A.W.","Fac. of Comput., Univ. Teknol.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths.

Our store-through does this by forwarding each out-of-order or IP-fragmented packet immediately after copying it even if it has not been checked yet. Although the forwarded packet might turn out to be a part of an attack, the store-through can successfully defend against the attack by blocking one of the subsequent packets.

We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks.

The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment.

A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks,"Nogueira, A.; Salvador, P.; Blessa, F.","Inst. de Telecomun., Univ. of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal","Digital Telecommunications (ICDT), 2010 Fifth International Conference on",20100729,2010,,,57,62,"A concerted fight against botnets is needed in order to avoid them from becoming a serious threat to global security in the forthcoming years. Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.",,978-1-4244-7271-0,,10.1109/ICDT.2010.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380,Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile,Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic,,,,3,,20,,,13-19 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Our simulation used a responsive variant of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm and focused on the response performance. We assumed that the attacks had been detected and reported. We compared performance tradeoffs of attack, response, and network size by focusing on metrics such as goodput, i.e. percentage of messages that reach the intended destination untainted by the captured node. We showed, for example, that under general conditions a DoS attack response should minimize attacker impact while a response to a data swallowing attack should minimize risk to the system and trust of the compromised node with most of the response benefit.

This information can be useful for variety of purposes like monitoring home security, examining status of nodes, and replacing nodes that are malfunctioning or dead. The sensor network needs to be protected from intrusions and anomalies. Over the years, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed for preventing WSNs from intrusions. Although some mobile agent based IDS are proposed, anomaly detection for wireless smart home sensor network (WSHSN) is not fully exploited. In this article, we have proposed a mobile agent based anomaly detection mechanism for WSHSNs. The proposed scheme takes advantage from heterogeneous nature of devices in smart home for effectively detecting anomalies. The anomaly detection infrastructure is installed at resource rich nodes such as Cluster Heads (CHs).The mobile agent takes only few bytes of data to further assess the anomalous behavior of suspicious node. The analysis and comparative study show several advantages of the proposed scheme, such as efficient utilization of memory, reducing network load, and reduction in overall computational cost of the network.

Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,1987,1995,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576,,Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers,Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols,Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression,,2,,25,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Misleading worm signature generators using deliberate noise injection,"Perdisci, R.; Dagon, D.; Wenke Lee; Fogla, P.; Sharif, M.","Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA","Security and Privacy, 2006 IEEE Symposium on",20060619,2006,,,15 pp.,31,"Several syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators, e.g., Polygraph, have recently been proposed. These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces noise due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process. This study suggests that unless an accurate and robust flow classification process is in place, automatic syntactic-based signature generators are vulnerable to such noise injection attacks",1081-6011,0-7695-2574-1,,10.1109/SP.2006.26,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623998,,Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Noise generators;Noise level;Noise robustness;Pollution;Protection,invasive software,Polygraph;automatic syntactic-based signature generators;flow classifier;honeynet;imprecision inflow classification;intrusion detection system;misleading worm signature generators;noise injection attacks;robust flow classification;suspicious flows;syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators,,16,6,28,,,21-24 May 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
A methodology for P2P file-sharing traffic detection,"Spognardi, A.; Lucarelli, A.; Di Pietro, R.","Dipt. di Informatica, Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Italy","Hot Topics in Peer-to-Peer Systems, 2005. HOT-P2P 2005. Second International Workshop on",20051024,2005,,,52,61,"Since the widespread adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking during the late '90s, P2P applications have multiplied. Their diffusion and adoption are witnessed by the fact that P2P traffic accounts for a significant fraction of Internet traffic. Further, there are concerns regarding the use of these applications, for instance when they are employed to share copyright protected material. Hence, in many situations there would be many reasons to detect P2P traffic. In the late '90s, P2P traffic was easily recognizable since P2P protocols used application-specific TCP or UDP port numbers. However, P2P applications were quickly empowered with the ability to use arbitrary ports in an attempt to go undetected. Nowadays, P2P applications explicitly try to camouflage the originated traffic in an attempt to go undetected. Despite the presence of rules to detect P2P traffic, no methodology exists to extract them from applications without the use of reverse engineering. In this paper we develop a methodology to detect P2P traffic. It is based on the analysis of the protocol used by a P2P application, extraction of specific patterns unique to the protocol, coding of such a pattern in rules to be fed to an intrusion detection system (IDS), and validation of the pattern via network traffic monitoring with SNORT (an open source IDS) fed with the devised rules. In particular, we present a characterization of P2P traffic originated by the OpenNap and WPN protocols (implemented in the WinMx application) and FastTrack protocol (used by KaZaA) obtained using our methodology, that shows the viability of our proposal. Finally, we conclude the paper exposing our undergoing efforts in the extension of the methodology to exploit differences between centralized and decentralized P2P protocols, as well as the characterization of encrypted traffic, and highlight a new research direction in the identification of P2P traffic.",,0-7695-2417-6,,10.1109/HOT-P2P.2005.2,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517791,,Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Protection;Protocols;Reverse engineering;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;copyright;pattern recognition;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,FastTrack protocol;Internet traffic;KaZaA;OpenNap protocol;P2P application;P2P file-sharing traffic detection;P2P protocols;P2P traffic;SNORT;TCP;UDP;WPN protocol;copyright protected material;encrypted traffic characterization;intrusion detection system;network traffic monitoring;pattern extraction;peer-to-peer networking;reverse engineering,,12,1,23,,,21-Jul-05,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing.

Misuse detection compares recorded audit data with predefined patterns denoted as signatures. A signature is usually empirically engineered based on experience and expert knowledge. This induces relatively long development times for novel signatures causing inappropriate long vulnerability windows. Methods for a systematic engineering have been scarcely reported so far. Approaches for an automated re-use of design and modeling decisions of available signatures also do not exist. In this paper we present an approach for systematic engineering of signatures which is based on the re-use of existing signatures. It exploits similarities with known attacks for the engineering process. The method applies an iterative abstraction of signatures. Based on a weighted assessment of the abstractions the signature engineer can select the most appropriate signatures or fragments of signatures for the development of the signature for a new attack.

Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm. We finally present extensive simulation results of network-based virus/worm detection using real signature databases to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",,1-4244-0593-9,1-4244-0594-7,10.1109/ICNP.2006.320212,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110291,,Computer networks;Data security;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Payloads,Internet;computer viruses;database management systems;digital signatures;optimisation;string matching,Aho-Corasick algorithm;Internet;TCAM-based hardware;multi-gigabit rate search speed;multiple string matching algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;network-based virus/worm detection;optimization;pattern matching;security attack;signature database;string matching,,34,45,35,,,12-15 Nov. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The cloud service providers foresee it as a source of promising financial gains, the clients find it a convenient solution where the enterprises may get started on their computing activities without investing on the in-house facilities of hardware and software. They can outsource the computing and archiving activities to the cloud service providers (CSP) though Internet. There are many dimensions of these activities and the researchers are trying to find acceptable solutions for the industry. In this paper, we have focused on the information security issues when migrating to a cloud environment. The confidence of end user can be won partially by the guarantees of service provider and use of cryptographic techniques. It is important that the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) should be included in the models which support forensic study whenever required. It is equally important to address the issue of anti-forensic methods that the service providers may use to hide their malicious activities. Therefore the clients would like to have a better, in-depth knowledge of information management at service providers' end. For this purpose tools to probe into the cloud services are required. To elaborate on this issue we have chosen the data archiving and storage model used for medical service providers and hospitals. It is a classic test-case where Patients' history has to be maintained under the guidelines of HIPPA.

In the first part of the framework a social network has to be derived for a given community of users. In the second part the group of users that have the highest influence on the communication in the social network has to be located. The group betweenness centrality measure is used to evaluate the influence of each candidate group. In the third part we analyze the threat propagation in the social network assuming that a distributed network intrusion detection system (DNIDS) is monitoring the traffic of the group. The analysis is performed using a network simulator that was developed for this purpose. In the fourth part a DNIDS has to be deployed on a range of ISPs in order to monitor and clean the traffic of the users belonging to the central group. We applied the new framework by deriving the social network of 1000 students, finding the most influential group of users, and analyzing the influence of the deployment of DNIDS using a simulation tool.

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.",,978-1-4244-9211-4,,10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950,Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection,Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining,feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines,ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system,,4,1,16,,,12-14 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity.

In the proposed method, the IDS has additional knowledge about common multimedia file formats and uses this knowledge to perform a more detailed analysis of packets carrying that type of data. If the structure and selected contents of the data are compliant, the corresponding stream is tagged accordingly, and the IDS is spared from further work on that stream.

In this study, we analyze actual traffic traces from two Internet traffic archives and verify the traffic stability by various aspects. The analysis shows that there are significant differences in the traffic patterns among different sites.
