Firewall could prevent unauthorized access, but it cannot monitor network attacks. Another network security tool such as intrusion detection system is necessary to perform network activities monitoring.

To promote the performance of network intrusion detection system and reduce the processing time of the traffic, present studies on network intrusion detection system for high-speed network focus on parallel techniques as an alternative. In this paper, a kind of parallelism is proposed to improve the performance of signature based intrusion detection system.

A Biologically Modeled Intrusion Detection System for Mobile Networks,"Williams, B.C.; Fulp, E.W.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Wake Forest Univ., Wake Forest, NC, USA","Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), 2010 International Conference on",20101111,2010,,,453,458,"A computer security system is typically tasked with identifying an intrusion, which is defined as a set of actions that attempt to compromise, the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of any resources provided by a computing system [1] An attack on a computer system plays out in a series of sequential events, the granularity of which can vary drastically depending on the type of exploit. An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.",,978-1-4244-8448-5,978-0-7695-4236-2,10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852,ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence,Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation,computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems,biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator,,0,,16,,,4-6 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability.

The proposed hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system does not require additional software installed in virtual machines and has many advantages compared to host-based and network based intrusion detection systems which can complement these traditional approaches to intrusion detection.",,,,10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785472,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785472,Cloud Computing;hypervisor;intrusion detection,Cloud computing;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining,cloud computing;computer network security;software architecture;software metrics;virtual machines;virtualisation,CPU utilization;block device read requests;block device write requests;cloud computing resources;cloud features;hypervisor performance metrics;hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system;intrusion detection security;multitenancy;operating system;packet transmission;received packets;shared resource utilization;virtual machine performance metrics;virtualization;virtualization technology,,1,,16,,,3-6 Feb. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net.

Proceedings. 19th Annual",20040108,2003,,,34,43,"Web servers are ubiquitous, remotely accessible, and often misconfigured. In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways.

In this paper, a hierarchical VANETs intrusion detection system based on BUSNet is present. BUSNet is basically a virtual mobile backbone infrastructure that is constructed using public buses. We use the bus nodes as the cluster-heads to gather the routing control messages and data packets transmitted among the vehicles. The bus nodes first transmit the original network behavior information to the access points deployed along the road sides. Then the access points can get a global view of the VANETs, and we can detect anomaly behaviors through analyzing the data. The anomaly detection method is based on the neural network which can build the normal network behavior model through learning process. After the trained neural network is stable, it can monitor the VANETs security by detecting the network control message and data packet in real time and alarm immediately if there is anomaly behavior.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts.

The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, denial of service (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach cross layer based intrusion detection system(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance.

RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now.

This proliferation, in combination with the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods.

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are used for the detection of intrusive and malicious traffic in computer networks. Signature based IDS have been the most accurate among the available NIDS. But this accuracy is achieved at a cost of intensive computational power and inability to detect exploits whose signatures do not exist in the database. Statistical based IDS present a way to overcome these drawbacks with a compromise over accuracy. The key to the accuracy of the Statistical IDS lies in the classification algorithm adopted and the training data set used.

Many intrusion detection systems have been proposed and most of them are tightly related to routing protocols, such as Watchdog/Pathrater and Routeguard. These solutions include two parts: intrusion detection (Watchdog) and response (Pathrater and Routeguard). Watchdog resides in each node and is based on overhearing. Through overhearing, each node can detect the malicious action of its neighbors and report other nodes. However, if the node that is overhearing and reporting itself is malicious, then it can cause serious impact on network performance. In this paper, we overcome the weakness of Watchdog and introduce our intrusion detection system called ExWatchdog. The main feature of the proposed system is its ability to discover malicious nodes which can partition the network by falsely reporting other nodes as misbehaving and then proceeds to protect the network.

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically.

The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS.

Our proposed system runs Snort in software until it gets to the pattern matching function and then offloads that processing to the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The software can then go on to other processing while it waits for the results from the FPGA. The hardware is able to process data at upto 1.7 GB/s on one Xilinx XC2VP100 FPGA.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naive fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naive fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably Attack multipliers and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network.

The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes.

Network anomaly detection tools based on association rules,"Othman, Z.A.; Eljadi, E.E.","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.",2155-6822,978-1-4577-0753-7,,10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705,Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS),Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces,computer network security;data mining,CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule,,1,,25,,,17-19 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done.

It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way.

Among many network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), open source systems have gained substantial preference due to their flexibility, support and cost effectiveness. Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware. However; Snort detection capability is not improved by improving hardware and is dependent upon its internal architecture (signature database and rate filtration).

High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling,"Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.",,978-1-4577-0531-1,978-0-7695-4423-6,10.1109/SAINT.2011.12,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129,OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system,Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data,feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data,,3,,16,,,18-21 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Bayesian Model Averaging of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Intrusion Detection,"Liyuan Xiao; Yetian Chen; Chang, C.K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Iowa State Univ.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset.

Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network. Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination.

CompactDFA: Scalable Pattern Matching Using Longest Prefix Match Solutions,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya, Israel","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20140417,2014,22,2,415,428,"A central component in all contemporary intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is their pattern matching algorithms, which are often based on constructing and traversing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that represents the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states.

HOTI 2007. 15th Annual IEEE Symposium on",20070904,2007,,,65,72,New networking applications such as Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) require finding the frequently repeated strings in a packet stream for further investigation. The strategy of finding frequently repeated strings within a given time frame of the packet stream has been quite efficient to detect the polymorphic worms.

Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods.

Slow port scanning detection,"Dabbagh, M.; Ghandour, A.J.; Fawaz, K.; Hajj, W.E.; Hajj, H.",,"Information Assurance and Security (IAS), 2011 7th International Conference on",20120105,2011,,,228,233,"Port scanning is the most popular reconnaissance technique attackers use to discover services they can break into. Port scanning detection has received a lot of attention by researchers. However a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we present a new, simple, and efficient method for detecting slow port scans. Our proposed method is mainly composed of two phases: (1) a feature collection phase that analyzes network traffic and extracts the features needed to classify a certain IP as malicious or not. (2) A classification phase that divides the IPs, based on the collected features, into three groups: normal IPs, suspicious IPs and scanner IPs. The IPs our approach classify as suspicious are kept for the next (K) time windows for further examination to decide whether they represent scanners or legitimate users. Hence, this approach is different than the traditional approach used by IDSs that classifies IPs as either legitimate or scanners, and thus producing a high number of false positives and false negatives. A small Local Area Network was put together to test our proposed method. The experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method in correctly identifying malicious scanners when both normal and slow port scan were performed using the three most common TCP port scanning techniques. Moreover, our method detects malicious scanners that are otherwise not detected using well known IDSs such as Snort.",,978-1-4577-2154-0,,10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122824,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122824,Intrusion Detection System;Port Scanning,Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;IP networks;Probes;Security;Servers;Training data,local area networks;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,IDS;TCP port scanning techniques;feature collection phase;intrusion detection systems;local area network;reconnaissance technique attackers;slow port scanning detection,,3,,20,,,5-8 Dec. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps.

Intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system using wireless sensor actuator network,"Ghatak, S.; Bose, S.; Roy, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Netaji Subhash Eng.

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens.

The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats.

The goal is to identify and to cluster different alerts-produced by low-level intrusion detection systems, firewalls, etc.-belonging to a specific attack instance which has been initiated by an attacker at a certain point in time. Thus, meta-alerts can be generated for the clusters that contain all the relevant information whereas the amount of data (i.e., alerts) can be reduced substantially. Meta-alerts may then be the basis for reporting to security experts or for communication within a distributed intrusion detection system. We propose a novel technique for online alert aggregation which is based on a dynamic, probabilistic model of the current attack situation. Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low.

Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2008. ICCCN '08. Proceedings of 17th International Conference on",20081117,2008,,,1,6,"A rule-based intrusion detection system compares the incoming packets against rule set in order to detect intrusion. Unfortunately, it spends the majority of CPU time in packet classification to search for rules that match each packet. A common approach is to build a graph such as rule trees or finite automata for a given rule set, and traverse it using a packet as an input string. Because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. Exploring such a huge graph becomes a major bottleneck in high-speed networks since each packet incurs many memory accesses with little locality. In this paper, we propose rule hashing for fast packet classification in intrusion detection systems. The rule hashing, combined with hierarchical rule trees, saves memory and reduce the number of memory accesses by allowing the whole working set to be accommodated in a cache in most of the time, and thus improves response times in finding matching rules. We implement our algorithm in Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that our implementation is faster than original Snort to deal with the same real packet traces while consuming an order of magnitude less memory.",1095-2055,978-1-4244-2389-7,978-1-4244-2390-3,10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.120,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674280,,Automata;Databases;Engines;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Tree graphs,cryptography;finite automata;trees (mathematics),CPU time;Snort;finite automata;graph;hierarchical rule trees;open-source intrusion detection system;packet classification;rule hashing;rule-based intrusion detection system;security threats,,2,,13,,,3-7 Aug. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Active mapping: resisting NIDS evasion without altering traffic,"Shankar, U.; Paxson, V.","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA, USA","Security and Privacy, 2003. Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on",20030521,2003,,,44,61,"A critical problem faced by a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is that of ambiguity. The NIDS cannot always determine what traffic reaches a given host nor how that host will interpret the traffic, and attackers may exploit this ambiguity to avoid detection or cause misleading alarms. We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests. We found wide variation across operating systems' TCP/IP stack policies in real-world tests (about 6700 hosts), underscoring the need for this sort of disambiguation.",1081-6011,0-7695-1940-7,,10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199327,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199327,,Costs;Databases;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Prototypes;Runtime;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,authorisation;computer network management;network operating systems;network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,NIDS evasion;TCP/IP-based ambiguity;active mapping;disambiguation;host TCP/IP policies;host profiles;misleading alarms;network intrusion detection system;network topology profiles;operating systems;traffic,,26,28,20,,,11-14 May 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Towards feature subset selection in intrusion detection,"Ahmad, I.; e Amin, F.","Dept. of Software Eng., King Saud Univ., Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC), 2014 IEEE 7th Joint International",20150323,2014,,,68,73,"Intrusion is a serious issue in computer and network systems because a single intrusion can cause a heavy loss in few seconds. To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications.

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters.

In some cases the intrusion detection may also respond to anomalous or malicious traffic by taking action such as blocking of user or source address from accessing the network. IDS comes in variety of flavor but its goals to detecting suspicious traffic in different ways. There are network based and host based intrusion detection system. The IDS is detecting based looking for specific signature of known threats as it antivirus and firewall. The anomaly detection is used to comparing traffics against the baseline.

MobiQuitous 2007. Fourth Annual International Conference on",20080212,2007,,,1,8,"The exponential growth in wireless network faults, vulnerabilities, and attacks make the wireless local area network (WLAN) security management a challenging research area. Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.",,978-1-4244-1024-8,978-1-4244-1025-5,10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054,,Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks,data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels,WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network,,4,1,24,,,6-10 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel threats are an emerging area for the CPS world.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

Providing an online IDS to the storage controller is essential for dealing with compromised hosts or coordinated attacks by multiple hosts. SAN block storage controllers are connected to the world via block-level protocols, such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. Usually, block-level storage systems do not maintain information specific to the file-system using them. The range of threats that can be handled at the block level is limited. A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions. IDStor maintains a block-to-file mapping that is updated online. Using this mapping, IDStor infers the semantics of file-level commands from the intercepted block-level operations, thereby detecting file-level intrusions by merely observing the block read and write commands passing between the hosts and the controller.",,978-1-4244-7152-2,978-1-4244-7153-9,10.1109/MSST.2010.5496974,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496974,,Access protocols;Control systems;Event detection;File systems;Home appliances;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Storage area networks;Telecommunication traffic,file organisation;security of data;storage area networks,SAN block storage controller;block level protocol;file level command;file level intrusion detection system;storage area network;storage controller,,1,,18,,,3-7 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE",20091201,2002,4,1,2,15,"Network security has become a critical issue for enterprises. This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

The goal of an intruder is to attack a computer or a network system for malicious reasons and the goal of the intrusion detection system is to detect the actions of the intruder and warn the network administrator of an impending attack. We show how an intrusion detection system can recognize the plans of the intruder by modeling the domain as a logic program and then reducing the plan recognition problem to computing models of the logic program. This methodology has been used widely for several planning problems and fits very naturally for plan recognition problems. We give an example scenario and show how to model it.

For example, to avoid matching the attack payload to a NIDS signature, attackers split the payload into several TCP packets or hide it between benign messages. We observe that different attack instances can be derived from each other using simple transformations. We model these transformations as inference rules in a natural-deduction system. Starting from an exemplary attack instance, we use an inference engine to automatically generate all possible instances derived by a set of rules. The result is a simple yet powerful tool capable of both generating attack instances for NIDS testing and determining whether a given sequence of packets is an attack. In several testing phases using different sets of rules, our tool exposed serious vulnerabilities in Snort - a widely deployed NIDS.

In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds.

The features of MANETs are like open media, dynamic changes in topology, cooperative and collaborative algorithm and no centralized monitoring system. These features make the network more prone to malicious attack. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we present a new cluster based intrusion detection algorithm that takes care of black hole attacks in a MANET. This proposed algorithm is based on trustworthiness of the nodes in a network. The network is considered to be a layered structured. The nodes are member of a cluster. Each cluster has cluster head that takes care of all the members of its own cluster and communicates with cluster head at layer 2 whenever required. The cluster head at layer 2 communicate with all cluster head at layer 1. The selection of cluster head depends on three parameters battery power, mobility and trust value of a node in a cluster. Periodically the cluster head updation is done according to three parameters. We have implemented our algorithm using the NS simulator. The performance of the proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has also been evaluated in the process. The performance graph shows marked improvement as far as packet dropping is concerned.",,978-1-4799-2274-1,,10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726110,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726110,Black hole;Cluster;Layered Architecture;MANET,Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols,cryptography;firewalls;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,IDS;MANET features;MCBHIDS;centralized monitoring system;collaborative algorithm;encryption software;firewall software;intrusion detection algorithm;intrusion detection system;malicious attack;mobile ad hoc networks;modified layered cluster based algorithm for black hole IDS;open media;packet dropping,,0,,21,,,13-15 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes.

Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time. Two dimensionality reduction techniques are used one linear technique (Principal Component Analysis) and one non-linear technique (Multidimensional Scaling). Data is then submitted to two classification algorithms J48 (C.45) and Naive Bayes. This study was conducted using the KDD Cup 99 data. Experimental results show optimal performance with reduced datasets of 4 dimensions for J48 and 12 dimensions for Naive Bayes.",Pending,978-1-4577-1538-9,,10.1109/ICDIM.2011.6093368,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6093368,Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Multidimensional Scaling;Principal Component Analysis,Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Covariance matrix;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis,Internet;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic,C.45;Internet traffic;J48;NIDS;classification algorithm;denial of service attack;dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;feature selection;machine learning;multidimensional scaling;naive Bayes method;network intrusion detection system;nonlinear technique;principal component analysis,,1,,32,,,26-28 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources.

It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.",,978-1-4244-2201-2,978-1-4244-2202-9,10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004,,Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security,AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy,,1,,18,,,6-8 Aug. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Tenth International Conference on",20020807,2001,,,159,165,"Since late 1999, DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack has drawn many attentions from both research and industry communities. Many potential solutions (e.g., ingress filtering, packet marking or tracing, and aggregate-based congestion control or rate limiting) have been proposed to handle this network bandwidth consumption attack. Among them, ICMP traceback (iTrace) is currently being considered as an industry standard by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). While the idea of iTrace is very clever, efficient, reasonably secure and practical, it suffers a serious statistic problem such that the chance for useful and valuable iTrace messages can be extremely small against various types of DDoS attacks. This implies that most of the network resources spent on generating and utilizing iTrace messages will be wasted. Therefore, we propose a simple enhancement called intention-driven iTrace, which conceptually introduces an extra bit in the routing and forwarding process. With the new intention-bit, it is shown that, through our simulation study, the performance of iTrace improves dramatically.

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging.

In many application cases it is sufficient to provide message authentication at the sink. To implement this requirement using symmetric ciphers, keys shared between each sensor node and the sink have to be established and kept fresh during network operation. This paper presents a key distribution scheme based on the well known elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism that allows us to fulfil the previously outlined requirements efficiently. The DHB-KEY scheme requires only the distribution of a single sink-initiated broadcast message to set individual keys on all sensor nodes. Thus, DHB-KEY has a low complexity and preserves scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy. In the paper we present a protocol specification based on the DHB-KEY scheme and its implementation for the well known TinyOS platform.

XFA: Faster Signature Matching with Extended Automata,"Smith, R.; Estan, C.; Jha, S.","Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI","Security and Privacy, 2008. SP 2008. IEEE Symposium on",20080528,2008,,,187,201,"Automata-based representations and related algorithms have been applied to address several problems in information security, and often the automata had to be augmented with additional information. For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.",1081-6011,978-0-7695-3168-7,,10.1109/SP.2008.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153,finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching,Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata,extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity,,35,3,33,,,18-22 May 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder","Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2007. SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,678,684,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior.

This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior.

These data items read or written in the course of updating one data item construct the read set, pre-write set, and the post-write set for this data item. The proposed method identifies malicious transactions by comparing these sets with data items read or written in user transactions.

Fourth IEEE International Workshop on",20060508,2006,,,16 pp.,50,"Many recent computer attacks have been launched in multiple stages to evade the detection of existing intrusion detection systems (IDS). Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999).

This can be used to verify the result of the intrusion attempt. We then extend this method to verify the result of attacks that still generate valid protocol status code in the server responses.

Such applications can implement logic to provide complex quarantine procedures, or redirect malicious network flows for their special treatment. Security detection and intrusion prevention algorithms can be implemented as OpenFlow security applications, however, their implementation is often more concise and effective.

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC",20050606,2004,,,265,271,"A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.",,0-7803-8572-1,,10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826,,Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement,computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering,,0,,8,,,10-11 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Trojan detection using MIB-based IDS / IPS system,"Pattinson, C.; Hajdarevic, K.","Innovation North Fac., Leeds Metropolitan Univ., Leeds, UK","Information, Communication and Automation Technologies, 2009.

XXII International Symposium on",20091204,2009,,,1,5,"Identifying and detecting Trojans (malicious software installed and run on a host, without the acquiescence of the host's owner) is a major element in delivering computer security. As with any computer application, installation of a Trojan leaves a ldquofootprintrdquo on the systems resources. However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems. We identify the characteristics of typical attacks in respect of the impact they have on particular MIB objects, and propose a decision-tree based algorithm which can detect Trojan activity.

Intrusion detection systems attempt to detect things that are wrong in a computer network or system. The main problems of these systems, however, are the many false alarms they produce, their lack of resistance to both malicious attacks and accidental failures, and the constant appearance of new attacks and vulnerabilities. IBM Zurich Research Laboratory has developed a system that specifically targets worms rather than trying to prevent all breaches of computer security. Called Billy Goat, the specialized worm detection system runs on a dedicated machine connected to the network and detects worm-infected machines anywhere in it. Billy Goat has been proven effective at detecting worm-infected machines in a network. It is currently used in several large corporate intranets, and it is normally able to detect infected machines within seconds of their becoming infected. Furthermore, not only is it able to detect the presence of a worm in the network, it can even provide the addresses of the infected machines.

To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

The optimum distribution of traffic to the sensors is a challenging task. We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced. This mechanism of policy-reloading also take into account the similarity between all possible pairs of policies and tries to minimize the packet duplication rate during the operation of the system.

Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin.

In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study.

The user behavior parameters are used to generate templates, which can be further customized.

A Robust Approach for Matching Mixed Casesensitive and Case-insensitive Patterns,Hongbin Lu; Kai Zheng; Bin Liu; Changhua Sun,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing","Networking and Services, 2007. ICNS. Third International Conference on",20080122,2007,,,72,72,"As one of the key methods as well as a bottleneck for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes) to detect and eliminate malicious traffic, pattern matching is increasingly gaining popularity while also faces threats from hackers' overloading attempts. The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the Search phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.",,978-0-7695-2858-9,,10.1109/ICNS.2007.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321,,Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system,,0,,15,,,19-25 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
AC-Suffix-Tree: Buffer Free String Matching on Out-of-Sequence Packets,"Xinming Chen; Kailin Ge; Chen, Zhen; Jun Li","Dept. of Autom., Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2011 Seventh ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20111031,2011,,,36,44,"TCP and IP fragmentation can be used to evade signature detection at Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS / IPS). Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.",,978-1-4577-1454-2,978-0-7695-4521-9,10.1109/ANCS.2011.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710,Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching,Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security,buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching,AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection,,0,,12,,,3-4 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms.

In order to solve such security issues, we purpose a NIDS architecture which addresses the same constraints as a cluster: efficiency, scalability and reliability. It is based on the cluster paradigm. We stress on the facts that network packets must be dispatched according to streams and analysis must be load-balanced at process level.

DDoS-Shield: DDoS-Resilient Scheduling to Counter Application Layer Attacks,"Ranjan, S.; Swaminathan, R.; Uysal, M.; Nucci, A.; Knightly, E.",,"Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20090218,2009,17,1,26,39,"Countering distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is becoming ever more challenging with the vast resources and techniques increasingly available to attackers. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds.

Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a unsafe zone to isolate user's SQL queries from a safe zone of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs.

Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.",,978-1-4673-2164-8,,10.1109/HPCC.2012.186,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332322,Denial of Service;Neural Network;Security;Support Vector Machine;Wireless Sensor Networks,Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;real-time systems;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,DoS attack probability detection;MAC;SVM;WSN;denial of service;machine learning;medium access control;neural network;real-time system monitoring;security enhancement;security flaw;support vector machine;wireless sensor network,,1,,14,,,25-27 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic.

IEEE",20020806,2001,1,,87,91 vol.1,"ATM networks are the foundation for a number of public and private networks and their correct operation is critical to the availability of higher layer protocols (such as IP) and applications. However, ATM uses a number of protocols for connection establishment and routing and if these protocols are not functioning correctly (e.g., due to misconfiguration, component failure or active attack), denial of service may result. Since ATM protocol irregularities occur below IP, they are not detectable by the IP intrusion detection systems that are prevalent in today's networks. This paper describes an implementation of an intrusion detection system that detects ATM protocol attacks. This system uses a centralized assessment engine to collect network event notifications from a distributed set of sensors. These sensors monitor ATM protocol activity and send the filtered events to the assessment engine. The assessment engine compares the incoming event traffic against a set of attack templates and, if a match is encountered, it (optionally) activates a set of responses.

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy.

As they provide a strong isolation between the virtual environment and the underlying real system, virtual machines can also be used to improve the security of a computer system in face of attacks to its network services. This work presents a new approach to achieve this goal, by applying intrusion detection techniques to virtual machine based systems, thus keeping the intrusion detection system out of reach from intruders. The results obtained from a prototype implementation confirm the usefulness of this approach.",1089-6503,0-7695-2199-1,,10.1109/EURMIC.2004.1333416,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333416,,Costs;Data security;Hardware;Information security;Intrusion detection;Linux;Operating systems;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing,concurrency control;operating systems (computers);security of data;virtual machines,computer system security;intrusion detection;network services;operating systems;virtual machine environment,,11,4,19,,,31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS",,0-7695-2549-0,,10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271,IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.,Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic,ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security,MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network,,3,,16,,,29-29 June 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
An automatic portscan detection system with adaptive threshold setting,"Kim, Sang Kon; Lee, Seung Ho; Seo, Seung Woo","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science &#x0026; Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Korea","Communications and Networks, Journal of",20121220,2010,12,1,74,85,"For the purpose of compromising hosts, attackers including infected hosts initially perform a portscan using IP addresses in order to find vulnerable hosts. Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners.

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data.

We demonstrate the utility of the interface by conducting a case study on a set of firewall and intrusion detection system logs from Dshield.org.

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule.

Our algorithm need not be adjusted to network status because its parameters depend on application types, which are generally and widely used in any networks such as web and P2P services. By using real traces, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with that of SNORT. The results confirm that our algorithm outperforms SNORT with respect to detection rate and false positive rate.",8164-9547,1-4244-0355-3,1-4244-0355-3,10.1109/ICC.2006.255084,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024479,,Computer science;Computer worms;Detection algorithms;Filtering;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services,,,,0,,17,,,Jun-06,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This makes the network susceptible to Byzantyne faults with packets getting misrouted, corrupted or dropped. In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the detection manager to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy.

In this work, we propose an autonomous host-based intrusion detection system for detecting malicious sinking behavior. The proposed detection system maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross-layer features to define a routing behavior. For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed.

The secure networking framework is consisted of SGS and CPCS. SGS acts as an intrusion detection system on edge of network ingress point, and CPCS acts as a higher-level server. SGS makes an alert data compatible IDMEF and sends it to CPCS. CPCS parses an IDMEF alert data and makes an alert object for using correlation analysis. SGS can see its area only, but CPCS can see wide network area. CPCS can detect more complex attacks as well as support integrated management through cooperating each other. In the view of alert processing we converted raw alert data to Ladon-alert data to support interoperability. We use IDMEF-compatible alert datat structure.

In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision.

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.",1081-6011,0-7695-2339-0,,10.1109/SP.2005.1,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056,,Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring,automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data,IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm,,7,1,19,,,8-11 May 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The lack of proper tools slows down the hunt for information, which would otherwise help in gaining the upper hand against IT based perpetrators. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper. The evaluation of the new method shows a detection rate of 99.2 %, without generating any false positives, when used to scan for JPEG data.

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses.

This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance, 2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses bad mouthing and 4) resists collusion.",,1-4244-1315-X,1-4244-1316-8,10.1109/SDRN.2007.4348973,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4348973,,Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Standards development;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML,,,,0,,22,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society",20030923,2003,,,53,59,"We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a <sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %.

Robust and Fast Pattern Matching for Intrusion Detection,"Namjoshi, K.; Narlikar, G.","Bell Labs., Alcatel-Lucent, Paris, France","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE",20100506,2010,,,1,9,"The rule language of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a critical role in its effectiveness. A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149,,Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness,backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data,Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language,,4,1,36,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

DoS attacks to Web services are called HTTP-GET flood attack and threats of them increase day by day. In this type of attacks, malicious clients send a large number of HTTP-GET requests to the target Web server automatically. Since these HTTP-GET requests have legitimate formats and are sent via normal TCP connections, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can not detect them. In this paper, we propose HTTP-GET flood detection techniques based on analysis of page access behavior.

Meanwhile, it is easy to deploy and terminate large number of malicious virtual machines (VMs) in a few seconds while the administrator is probably difficult to identify these malicious VMs immediately. These features open doors for attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that target at degrading the quality of cloud service. This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors.

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters.

UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems. This paper describes the UnC architecture in detail, including the actions of each different kind of participant.

On the Effectiveness of Monitoring for Intrusion Detection in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Boppana, R.V.; Xu Su","Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.210,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919,Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.,Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement,Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration,,3,,32,,11/9/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,
Framework for Zombie Detection Using Neural Networks,"Salvador, P.; Nogueira, A.; Franca, U.; Valadas, R.","Inst. de Telecomun., Univ. of Aveiro, Aveiro","Internet Monitoring and Protection, 2009. ICIMP '09. Fourth International Conference on",20090619,2009,,,14,20,"One of the most important threats to personal and corporate Internet security is the proliferation of zombie PCs operating as an organized network. Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by licit and illicit network applications. The evaluation of the proposed methodology relies on traffic traces obtained in a controlled environment and composed by licit traffic measured from normal activity of network applications and malicious traffic synthetically generated using the subseven backdoor.

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector.

Detecting Malicious Javascript in PDF through Document Instrumentation,"Daiping Liu; Haining Wang; Stavrou, A.",,"Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on",20140922,2014,,,100,111,"An emerging threat vector, embedded malware inside popular document formats, has become rampant since 2008. Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability.

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database.

This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss.

Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.",,978-1-4244-1432-1,978-1-4244-1433-8,10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468,,Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN,,,,9,,16,,,10-14 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

As the data traffic generation is based on control traffic, the behavior of the two planes is expected to be similar during normal behavior.

Exploiting Artificial Immune systems to detect unknown DoS attacks in real-time,Dawei Wang; Longtao He; Yibo Xue; Yingfei Dong,"Nat. Comput. network Emergency Response Tech.

Payload-based approaches are effective to known DOS attacks but are unable to be deployed on high-speed networks. To address this issue, flow-based DOS detection schemes have been proposed for highspeed networks as an effective supplement of payload-based solutions. However, existing flow-based solutions have serious limitations in detecting unknown attacks and efficiently identifying real attack flows buried in the background traffic. In addition, existing solutions also have difficulty to adapt to attack dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a flow-based DOS detection scheme based on Artificial Immune systems. We adopt a tree structure to store flow information such that we can effectively extract useful features from flow information for better detecting DoS attacks. We employ Neighborhood Negative Selection (NNS) as the detection algorithm to detect unknown DoS attacks, and identify attack flows from massive traffic. Because the strong tolerance of NNS, the proposed solution is able to quickly adapt attack dynamics. The experimental results show that this solution is able to effectively detect unknown DoS attack flows and identify attack flows from background traffic. Meanwhile, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that this system can extract flow features more effectively.",,978-1-4673-1855-6,,10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664254,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664254,Artificial immune;DoS attack;Flow;Intrusion detection,Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Data mining;Detectors;Feature extraction;IP networks;Protocols,Internet;artificial immune systems;computer network security;real-time systems;telecommunication traffic,DoS attack flows;DoS attacks;Internet;NNS;artificial immune systems;attack dynamics;background traffic;detection algorithm;flow information;flow-based DOS detection schemes;flow-based solutions;high-speed networks;neighborhood negative selection;payload-based approaches;payload-based solutions;real attack flows;tree structure,,0,,14,,,Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

A Distributed Hierarchical Policy Management System for Security Control over Tactical Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Kirthika Parmeswaran; Coan, B.; Burns, Jim; Mouchtaris, P.; Lucas, Stephen W.",Telcordia Technologies,"Military Communications Conference, 2007. MILCOM 2007. IEEE",20080222,2007,,,1,9,"Tactical mobile ad hoc wireless networks can provide flexibility, agility, and mobility for dynamic network-centric warfare. They are designed to function without fixed infrastructure support. But, this design makes network security attacks hard to detect and control. For instance, an attacker could compromise one portion of the network by inducing a worm and then move to another portion of the network and replay the attack without being detected. In this paper, we describe a policy management system (PMS) that provides ubiquitous and consistent security policy control despite adverse conditions such as node mobility, node failures, network partitions, a compromise of the routing infrastructure, a high packet loss rate, and ongoing cyber attacks. We give performance results in a 47-node emulated network. Key challenges in tactical networks include a lossy environment with bit error rates as high as 0.001 and bandwidth as low as 500Kbits/s. TCP backs off in the face of packet loss and hence behaves poorly in such networks. Tactical network are also subject to cyber attacks that have the potential even to compromise the routing infrastructure. Our PMS architecture mitigates these issues by using a transport protocol that has two components, one oriented toward normal operation when the routing infrastructure is functioning and one oriented toward limited, but robust, operation even when the routing infrastructure has been compromised. In normal operation we use a reliable UDP protocol (RUDP) and in times of compromise we use a flooding protocol.",,978-1-4244-1513-7,978-1-4244-1513-7,10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455069,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455069,,Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Computer security;Control systems;Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Transport protocols;Wireless networks,,,,2,,13,,,29-31 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

High-interaction client honeypots (HICHPs) classify potentially malicious Web pages by driving a dedicated vulnerable Web browser to retrieve and classify these pages. Considering the size of the Internet, the ability to identify many malicious Web pages is a crucial task. HICHPs, however, present challenges: They are slow and tend to miss attacks. For researchers to address these shortcomings, they need methods for evaluating HICHPs. This paper (1) presents an evaluation method called the true positive cost curve (TPCC), which makes it possible to evaluate and compare HICHPs in an operating environment, but also allows an operator to tune HICHPs within a specific operating environment; (2) presents improvements on the way HICHPs visit Web pages and evaluates them with the TPCC method; and (3) discusses the impact of time bombs on the performance of HICHPs in an operating environment and the ability to tune an HICHP for optimal performance with the help of the TPCC.",,978-0-7695-3668-2,,10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211044,client honeypot;evaluation;intrusion detection;security,Computer science;Computer security;Cost function;Design engineering;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Weapons;Web pages;Web server,Internet;Web sites;client-server systems;online front-ends;security of data,HICHP;Internet;classification;cost-based evaluation method;dedicated vulnerable Web browser;high-interaction client honeypot;potentially malicious Web page;security device;time bomb;true positive cost curve,,4,,28,,,18-23 June 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20140227,2014,63,1,270,289,"This paper presents a new method, capable of automatically generating attacks on binary programs from software crashes. We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt.

Proceedings. IEEE,20021107,2002,3,,1530,1539,"We propose a simple and robust mechanism for detecting SYN flooding attacks. Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.",0743-166X,0-7803-7476-2,,10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404,,Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server,,,,86,7,35,,,23-27 June 2002,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Probabilistic Route Selection Algorithm to Trace DDoS Attack Traffic Source,Hongbin Yim; Taewon Kim; Jaeil Jung,"Dept. of Electron. Comput.

Moreover, it is very difficult to find a real origin of attackers because DoS/DDoS attacker uses spoofed IP addresses. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic route selection algorithm to trace the attacker's real origin. This algorithm uses three types of packets such as an alert packet, an agent packet and a reply agent packet. The alert packet is in use to notify to a victim that DDoS attacks occur. The agent packet is in use to find the attacker's real origin and the reply agent packet is in use to notify to a victim that the agent packet is reached the edge router of the attacker. When source-end detector and victim-end detector detect attacks, the victim-end detector sends the alert packet to the victim. The victim received the alert packet generates the agent packet and sends it to a victim's edge router. The attacker's edge router received the agent packet generates the reply agent packet and send it to the victim. The agent packet and the reply agent packet is forwarded refer to probabilistic packet forwarding table by routers. The probabilistic route selection algorithm runs on the distributed routers and probabilistic packet forwarding table is stored and managed by routers.

Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system.

This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected.

This is due to the inherent benefits of virtualization including fault tolerance through checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanisms. Because clouds are the abstraction of large data enters and large data enters have a higher potential for failure, it is imperative that a C/R mechanism for such an environment provide minimal latency as well as a small checkpoint file size. Recently, there has been much research into C/R with respect to virtual machines (VM) providing excellent solutions to reduce either checkpoint latency or checkpoint file size. However, these approaches do not provide both. This paper presents a method of check pointing VMs by utilizing virtual machine introspection (VMI). Through the usage of VMI, we are able to determine which pages of memory within the guest are used or free and are better able to reduce the amount of pages written to disk during a checkpoint. We have validated this work by using various benchmarks to measure the latency along with the checkpoint size. With respect to checkpoint file size, our approach results in file sizes within 24% or less of the actual used memory within the guest.

Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans.

Only knowing whether a message contains an attack, however, is not always enough to mitigate the threat. It may also be critical to know what it does. Unfortunately, shell code is written in low-level assembly language, and can be obfuscated. The current method of analyzing shell code, manual reverse engineering, is time-consuming, requires significant expertise, and would be nearly impossible for a wide-scale polymorphic attack. In this paper, we introduce Spector, a symbolic execution engine that extracts meaningful high-level actions from shell code. Spector's high-level output helps facilitate attack mitigation and classification of different payloads that have the same behavior. To evaluate Spector, we tested it with over 23,000 unique payloads. It identified eleven different classes of shell code, and processed all the payloads in just over three hours.

Features Selection for Intrusion Detection Systems Based on Support Vector Machines,"Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON","Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2009.

A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

In particular, attack attribution and situational understanding are considered critical aspects to effectively deal with emerging, increasingly sophisticated Internet attacks. This requires highly scalable analysis tools to help analysts classify, correlate and prioritise security events, depending on their likely impact and threat level. However, this security data mining process typically involves a considerable amount of features interacting in a non-obvious way, which makes it inherently complex. To deal with this challenge, we introduce MR-TRIAGE, a set of distributed algorithms built on MapReduce that can perform scalable multi-criteria data clustering on large security data sets and identify complex relationships hidden in massive datasets. The MR-TRIAGE workflow is made of a scalable data summarisation, followed by scalable graph clustering algorithms in which we integrate multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Theoretical computational complexity of the proposed parallel algorithms are discussed and analysed.

IEEE International Conference on",20070904,2007,,,190,195,"In this paper, a framework is proposed to defend against Internet bandwidth attacks with traffic resource management to provide service for legitimate users. Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.",,1-4244-1500-4,1-4244-1500-4,10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619,,Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server,Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management,,0,,14,,,13-15 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized.

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated.

Using customised analysis tools we study the traffic collected from the MANET at three different stages: i) regular operation, ii) with a benign wormhole joining distant parts of the network, and iii) under stress from wormhole attackers who control a link in the MANET and drop packets at random. Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis.

However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2].

The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms.

Cyber Security and Operational Reliability,"Meliopoulos, S.; Cokkinides, G.; Beyah, R.; Walters, S.; Myrda, P.",,"System Sciences (HICSS), 2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on",20150330,2015,,,2655,2663,"This paper presents a new proposed infrastructure that enables simultaneous cyber security and operational security. The basis of the method is command interception and fast authentication from the cyber security point of view (reliable detection of cyber intrusions) and from the operational reliability point of view. To simplify the process, the command authentication is done at the relay level and relay controls. As such it does not depend on the communication architecture. The method is based on new developments on dynamic state estimation based protection and substation level distributed state estimation. This infrastructure provides the capability to monitor, intercept, and authenticate/block commands as they reach the relay and the control circuits of the relay. Since all controls are exercise through a relay, this approach provides 100% coverage. The authentication/blockage of commands is done quickly because of the distributed approach which enables quick assembly of a local real time model and fast analytics with this local model. Specifically, for each command the proper local real time model is constructed and quickly analyzed to determine the effects on the power system. The analytics determine the effect of the command, if executed, on the system and in particular on the operational reliability of the system. In case of a command that may have adverse effects on the operational reliability of the system, the command will be blocked and the operator will be alerted. In addition to the command authentication at the relay level, an open-source real-time network monitoring system for capturing and parsing network traffic is presented. Because the method is based on the substation level dynamic state estimator which uses only local substation level measurements and data, a byzantine type attack is not considered possible for the proposed approach. Finally, a discussion on the architecture required to integrate the network monitoring and state estimation sys- ems is presented.

Quantifying Information Leaks in Outbound Web Traffic,"Borders, K.; Prakash, A.","Web Tap Security, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Security and Privacy, 2009 30th IEEE Symposium on",20090818,2009,,,129,140,"As the Internet grows and network bandwidth continues to increase, administrators are faced with the task of keeping confidential information from leaving their networks. Todaypsilas network traffic is so voluminous that manual inspection would be unreasonably expensive. In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer.

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data.

Autonomic Parameter Tuning of Anomaly-Based IDSs: an SSH Case Study,"Sperotto, A.; Mandjes, M.; Sadre, R.; de Boer, P.-T.; Pras, A.","Centre for Telematics & Inf. Technol., Univ. of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions on",20120601,2012,9,2,128,141,"Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify network traffic instances by comparing them with a model of the normal network behavior. To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.",1932-4537,,,10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597,Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization,Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning,probability;security of data,SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager,,4,,41,,3/21/2012,Jun-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

As a result, anomaly or learning based intrusion detection mechanisms have been developed to cope with such attacks. Among variety of anomaly detection approaches, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) are known to be two of the best machine learning algorithms to classify normal from abnormal behaviors. In this paper a hybrid anomaly-based intrusion detection method is proposed that is based on these two methods. These methods are trained in supervised way. We use the following additional techniques to improve the performance of proposed approach: First, a feature selection technique using the entropy of features is used for extracting optimized information from KDD data set and second, a novel method is proposed to combine the results of these two learning based methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed hybrid approach by using the KDD dataset. The simulation results show that which features of KDD are better to distinguish the normal from abnormal traffics.

DDoS attacks often overwhelm or exhaust the resources of victims and typically result in abnormal bursty traffic passing through victim systems. In this paper, we develop a mechanism for diagnosing traffic anomalies caused by DDoS attacks on the basis of analyzing the behaviour of network traffic. The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour.

However, the security of IMS networks has not been fully examined. This paper presents a novel DoS attack against IMS. By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test.

We inject a certain degree of randomization into the Radio Resource Management (RRM) and Mobility Management (MM) procedure, so the parameters which are important to the attacks would be difficult to measure and the values measured would be much higher. Our simulation shows that the amount of signaling messages on the attack is decreased by 90% and the adverse impact to performance is just less than 10%. So the randomization method could efficiently defense the signaling attacks.",,978-1-4244-8033-3,978-1-4244-8035-7,10.1109/ICEIT.2010.5607650,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607650,Defense mechanism;DoS attack;Randomization method;System-design perspective,GSM;Member and Geographic Activities Board committees;Paging strategies;Telecommunication network reliability,3G mobile communication;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;randomised algorithms;telecommunication security;telecommunication signalling,3G cellular networks;3G wireless network;DoS attacks;denial-of-service;mobility management;paging attack;radio access bearer;radio resource management;randomization method;signaling attack,,1,,16,,,17-19 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Secondly, our method computes the KL divergence between the port pair distributions of the current and previous time intervals. Our method starts to find anomalous flows when the KL divergence deviates from a specified threshold.

Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think,"Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.",,"Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,185,190,"A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.",,,,10.1109/SPW.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302,,Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches,Internet;finite state machines;protocols,FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications,,0,,9,,,17-18 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision.

Most results to date, however, suggest ways to architect new software constructed from the ground up as autonomic systems, whereas in the real world organizations continue to use stovepipe legacy systems and/or build ''systems of systems'' that draw from a gamut of new and legacy components involving disparate technologies from numerous vendors. Our goal is to retrofit autonomic computing onto such systems, externally, without any need to understand or modify the code, and in many cases even when it is impossible to recompile. We present a meta-architecture implemented as active middleware infrastructure to explicitly add autonomic services via an attached feedback loop that provides continual monitoring and, as needed, reconfiguration and/or repair. Our lightweight design and separation of concerns enables easy adoption of individual components, as well as the full infrastructure, for use with a large variety of legacy, new systems, and systems of systems.

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.",1930-529X,1-4244-0356-1,1-4244-0357-X,10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932,,Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;invasive software,Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system,,0,,11,,,Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Most works focus on profile/model definition while critical issues related to anomaly measuring, aggregating and thresholding have not received similar attention. In this paper, we in particular address the issue of anomaly scoring and aggregating which is a recurring problem in multi-model anomaly-based approaches. We propose a two stage aggregation/thresholding scheme particularly suitable for multi-model anomaly-based approaches. The basic idea of our scheme is the fact that anomalous behaviors induce either intramodel anomalies or inter-model ones. Our scheme is designed for real-time detection of both intra-model and inter-model anomalies. More precisely, we propose local thresholding in order to detect intra-model anomalies and use a Bayesian network in order to, on one hand, extract inter-model regularities and serve, on the other hand, as an aggregating function for computing the overall anomaly score associated with each analyzed audit event. Our experimental studies, carried out on recent and real <i>http</i> traffic, show for instance that most Web-based attacks induce only intra-model anomalies and can be effectively detected in real-time.

The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures.

In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks.

As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

IEEE 6th International Conference on",20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",,978-1-4244-5113-5,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

An innovative framework for collaborative intrusion alert correlation,"Elshoush, H.T.I.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Univ. of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan","Science and Information Conference (SAI), 2014",20141009,2014,,,607,614,"Alert correlation analyzes the alerts from one or more Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDSs) to produce a concise overview of security-related activity on the network. The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks.

Sensor fusion for intrusion detection under false alarm constraints,"Pugh, M.; Brewer, J.; Kvam, J.","Sandia Nat. Labs., Livermore, CA, USA","Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS), 2015 IEEE",20150625,2015,,,1,6,"Sensor fusion algorithms allow the combination of many heterogeneous data types to make sophisticated decisions. In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain.

Stepping-stone detection algorithm based on order preserving mapping,"Ying-Wei Kuo; Shou-Hsuan; Huang, S.","Dept. of Comput.

Instead, intruders perform their attacks through a sequence of intermediary hosts before attacking the target. This type of attack is known as a stepping-stone attack. Stepping-stone detection is to determine if a host machine is being used as a stepping-stone by attackers. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for stepping-stone detection using a pervious mapping-based detection method. The technique reduces the detection problem to finding a mapping between two streams of packets. If our algorithm cannot find the mapping, then no such mapping exists. But if there is a mapping, then the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find one and the solution will always be the one with minimum indexed. We provide the proof of the correctness of the algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm has a low time complexity.

A FCM for a dynamic system is a signed graph consisted of relevant concepts and causal relationships/weights between the concepts in the system. With suitable weights defined by experts in the related areas, the inference of the FCM can provide meaningful modeling of the system. Thus correctness of the weights is crucial to the success of a FCM system. Normally the weights are set by experts in the related areas. Considering the possible inefficiency and subjectivity of experts when judging the weights, it is an appealing idea to generate weights automatically according to the samples obtained through observation of the system. Some training algorithms were proposed. However, to our best knowledge, few learning algorithm has been reported to generate weight matrix based on sample sequences with continuous values. In this paper, we introduce a new learning algorithm to train the weights of FCM. In the proposed algorithm, the weights are updated by gradient descent on a squared Bellman residual, which is an accepted method in machine learning.

In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms.

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system.

Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependability (DEPEND), 2010 Third International Conference on",20100907,2010,,,98,103,"Modern IT systems have evolved into complex distributed systems that support thousands of users, with each user requiring access to several applications. Single sign on (SSO) provides a convenient facility for managing user authentication such that a user only logs into a system once in order to gain access to many protected applications. For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the bad guys are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server. In this way we increase the dependability of the server and provide a new way to balance the trade-off between security and availability. We will show that SCIT provides increased security with little degradation in overall response time of the system.",,978-1-4244-7530-8,,10.1109/DEPEND.2010.23,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562840,SCIT;central authentication service;exposure time;persistence;pro-active;response time;single sign on;virtualization;vmware,Authentication;Browsers;Degradation;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining,message authentication,IT systems;SSO server;distributed systems;intrusion detection;prevention systems;self cleansing intrusion tolerance SSO;server dependability;single sign on server protection;user authentication,,1,,16,,,18-25 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Intrusion detection in role administrated database: Transaction-based approach,"Darwish, S.M.; Guirguis, S.K.; Ghozlan, M.M.","Dept. of Inf. Technol. Inst. of Grad. Studies & Res.

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction.

Large enterprise networks, such as the network for a major university, are very inviting targets to hackers who are looking to exploit networks. Large enterprise networks may consist of many machines running numerous operating systems. These networks normally have enormous storage capabilities and high speed/high bandwidth connections to the Internet. Due to the requirements for academic freedom, system administrators are restricted in what requirements they can place on users on these networks. The high bandwidth usages on these networks make it very difficult to identify malicious traffic within the enterprise network. We propose that a Honeynet can be used to assist the system administrator in identifying malicious traffic on the enterprise network.

However, the ability to traverse network address translation (NAT) and bypass firewalls, as well as the induced bandwidth burden due to the super node (SN) mechanism, make Skype considerably a threat to enterprise networks security and availability. Because Skype uses both encryption and overlays, detection and blocking of Skype is non- trivial. Motivated by the work ofBiondi and Desclaux [3], we adopt the view of Skype as a backdoor and we take a forensic approach to analyze it. We share our experience in this paper. With the forensic evidence, we identify a transport layer communication framework for Skype. We further formulate a set of socket-based detection and control policies for Skype traffics. Our detection method is a hybrid between payload and non-payload inspections, with improved accuracy and version sustainability over the traditional payload-only approaches.

Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection.

We describe a protocol, named Reliability Map Routing (RMR), which uses end-to-end Quality of Service metrics that include spatial reliability and trust. The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance.

Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases.

Network performance is sometimes reduced to unacceptable levels due to events such as congestion, equipment failure and information-warfare attacks. A popular solution to these problems is to increase available bandwidth within local area networks and across the wide area network. For the DoD, this option is often unavailable, especially for in-theater forces. It has been demonstrated that quality of service (QoS) policies, created with currently available commercial products, can improve the performance of IP-based networks by orders of magnitude. However, different QoS policies are needed to address specific scenarios such as a particular operational mission, a denial-of-service attack or bandwidth saturation. The network administrator must implement the appropriate QoS policy on an as-needed basis. This paper describes a prototype QoS event manager that automates the process of QoS policy implementation.

A SOC Framework for ISP Federation and Attack Forecast by Learning Propagation Patterns,"Takemori, K.; Miyake, Y.; Ishida, C.; Sasase, Iwao","KDDI R&D Labs., Kamifukuoka","Intelligence and Security Informatics, 2007 IEEE",20070625,2007,,,172,179,"A security operation center (SOC), which monitors network traffic on each domain, has been established to detect cyber attacks. However, there have been ever increasing worms and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet and the number of unknown attacks is increasing day by day. It is hard to defend network infrastructure via the SOC, which is operated by an internet service provider (ISP). It is thus important to predict new security threats and share incidents that occur with related ISPs. In the case of Japan, the Telecom Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Telecom-ISAC) Japan is established for a federation scheme with ISP operators against serious security incidents. In this research, we design a federation SOC framework that monitors wide-area networks and analyzes multi-point traffic using statistical approaches. It can suggest anomalous ISPs and traffic parameters automatically. Moreover, we propose an attack forecast technique to ensure a swift response to regular and new attacks. The technique depicts an attack map and learns attack propagation patterns by using the Bayesian inference.

We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic.

Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes.

During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions.

Proceedings. 8th International Symposium on",20020806,2000,,,466,473,"Examines the application of statistical traffic modeling for detecting novel attacks against computer networks. We discuss the application of network activity models and application models using the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set. Network activity models monitor the volume of traffic in the network, while application models describe the operation of application protocols. By plotting the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves induced by the traffic activity, we quantify the effectiveness of network activity models in discriminating normal connections from attack connections generated by denial-of-service and probing attacks. It is verified that denial-of-service and probing attacks leave traces on simple network activity models, with rates of false alarm which are comparable to the false alarm rates obtained by the participants of the 1998 DARPA evaluation, in which much more complex detection schemes were utilized.

Since both protocols utilize 4-way handshaking, we propose a Merkle-tree based handshaking scheme, which is capable of improving the resiliency of the network in a situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack.

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.",,978-1-4799-8098-7,,10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618,Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System,Hafnium;IP networks,Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing,AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback,,0,,18,,,28-30 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection.

Hash-AV: fast virus signature scanning by cache-resident filters,"Erdogan, O.; Pei Cao","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Stanford Univ., CA, USA","Global Telecommunications Conference, 2005. GLOBECOM '05. IEEE",20060123,2005,3,,6 pp.,,"Fast virus scanning is becoming increasingly important in today's Internet. While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning booster technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of no-match cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of bad but cheap hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for on-access virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an on-access version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.",,0-7803-9414-3,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953,,Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical),Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory,CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception,,12,7,25,,,28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics.

The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes.

Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic.

With the aid of APT malware, attackers can remotely control infected machines and steal sensitive information. DNS is popular for malware to locate command and control (C&C) servers. In this paper, we propose a novel system placed at the network egress point that aims to efficiently and effectively detect APT malware infections based on malicious DNS and traffic analysis. The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA 10. KIDS core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties.

An effective Black hole attack detection mechanism using Permutation Based Acknowledgement in MANET,"Dave, D.; Dave, P.","CSE Dept., NIT, Warangal, India","Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI, 2014 International Conference on",20141201,2014,,,1690,1696,"With the evolution of wireless technology and use of mobile devices, Mobile Ad-hoc Network has become popular among researchers to explore. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets.

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns.

We propose a distributed connectivity maintenance protocol that explicitly accounts for the probabilistic nature of communication links and achieves a given target communication quality between nodes.

Such attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software to override its program control-flow and consequently invoke system calls, causing out-of-process damage. Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.",1550-445X,978-1-4799-3629-8,,10.1109/AINA.2014.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655,Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security,Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology,filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic,NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection,,0,,19,,,13-16 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Considering the fact that a computer network usually includes various kinds of operating systems, two versions of agents for Windows and Linux is implemented.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent.

In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network.

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general.

Our method is based on the concept of BLINd Classification or BLINC: no access to packet payload, no knowledge of port numbers, and no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern. In this work we create three types of graphlets for the following DoS attack patterns: SYN flood, ICMP flood, and host scan. Results show that our method can identify all occurrences and all hosts associated with attack activities, with a low percentage of false positive.",1556-6463,978-1-4244-1230-3,978-1-4244-1230-3,10.1109/ICON.2007.4444065,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444065,,Availability;Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computer science;Floods;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services,Internet;computer network reliability;telecommunication security,DoS attack;Internet;denial of service;lightweight detection;network security;system survivability,,4,,19,,,19-21 Nov. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS.

Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point.

On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM. The director on the introspection VM filters all the alerts and delegates the execution of a proper action to a notifier whenever an intrusion or an attempt to modify the IDSes is detected.

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions. Further, we have implemented a low-overhead TARF module in TinyOS; as demonstrated, this implementation can be incorporated into existing routing protocols with the least effort.

Hence, there is a need to design security scheme with the capabilities to protect the network and the sink node on the occurrence of attack. In this paper, we aim to provide security with a reactive security scheme that includes studying the behavioral aspect of attacks and congregating the security demands. This scheme successively conglomerates the security and the network rescue mechanism free from attacks and their impacts on the network.

However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.",,978-1-59593-082-8,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260,data-caches;multithreading;network processors,Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput,internetworking;multi-threading,asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses,,6,3,42,,,26-28 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Based on such sensing relevancies, we propose an energy-efficient visual monitoring mechanism where the frequency of image snapshots transmitted by each source node will be a function of the monitoring relevance of the node for the application. Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes.

Comparison of Two Intrusion Detection Schemes for Sparsely Connected Ad Hoc Networks,"Chuah, M.; Yang, P.","Dept. of Comput.

IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,7,"Several approaches have been proposed for intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks. Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks.

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of self-driving cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of connected vehicles (United States) or cooperative ITS (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities.

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software.

We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system.

Network intrusion detection based on neuro-fuzzy classification,"Toosi, A.N.; Kahani, M.; Monsefi, R.","Commun. & Comput. Res.

International Conference on",20091002,2006,,,1,5,"With rapid growth of computer networks during the past few years, network security has become a crucial issue. Among the various network security measures, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role to integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources. It seems that the presence of uncertainty and the imprecise nature of the intrusions make fuzzy systems suitable for such systems. Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities. Experiments for evaluation of the classifiers were performed with the KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset.

IEEE International Symposium on",20091228,2009,,,1,10,"An emerging class of applications for enterprise wireless LANs (WLAN) is voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which impose a stringent requirement on end-to-end delay. Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device.

However even though market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact to overall system cost. How the synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length is presented.

In fact, these features should highly characterize the behavior of the signaling traffic so that the evidence of the intrusion is not lost when only these attributes are considered for the attack detection goal.

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption.

At the state-of-the-art, IDS produce voluminous alerts, most false alarms, and function mainly by recognizing the signatures of known attacks so that novel attacks slip past them. Attempts have been made to create systems that recognize the signature of normal, in the hope that they will then detect attacks, known or novel. These systems are often confounded by the extreme variability of nominal behavior. This paper describes an experiment with an IDS composed of a hierarchy of neural networks (NN) that functions as a true anomaly detector. This result is achieved by monitoring selected areas of network behavior, such as protocols, that are predictable in advance. While this does not cover the entire attack space, a considerable number of attacks are carried out by violating the expectations of the protocol/operating system designer. Within this focus, the NNs are trained using data that spans the entire normal space. These detectors are able to recognize attacks that were not specifically presented during training. We show that using small detectors in a hierarchy gives a better result than a single large detector.

Under the context of flow state maintenance not deployed in the network elements, the bandwidth characterization of the attack traffic is essential to deploy the filtering rules in the equipments. In this work we have considered the network bandwidth characterization of a highly critical DDoS attack in the network: the distributed reflector attack through spoofed IPv6 flows. The generated spoofed IPv6 traffic from the attacker (slaves), the reflector attack traffic caused by the responses from the reflector and the victim, and the end-to-end path bandwidth characteristics of these flows over a 6 to 4 tunnel are reported in terms of flow rates and per flow packet count. The flow rate pattern of the spoofed flows is modeled at the attacker side using inter departure time and packet size.

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node.

TCP/IP Model and Intrusion Detection Systems,"Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON","Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops, 2009. WAINA '09. International Conference on",20090626,2009,,,90,96,"To accommodate the information security growth and hacker's improved strategies and tools, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are required to be allocated across the network. Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: application layer IDS (AIDS), transport layer IDS (TIDS), network layer IDS (NIDS) and link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type. The experimental results indicate that each IDS type has different features set that can not only improve the overall performance of the IDS, but it also can improve its scalability.",,978-1-4244-3999-7,978-0-7695-3639-2,10.1109/WAINA.2009.12,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136630,Intrusion detection systems;TCP/IP network model;features ranking;features selection;support vector decision function;support vector machines,Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data processing;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Support vector machines;TCPIP,security of data;transport protocols,TCP/IP network layer;application layer;information security;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network allocation;network devices;transport layer,,1,,24,,,26-29 May 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Fast Algorithms for Heavy Distinct Hitters using Associative Memories,"Bandi, N.; Agrawal, D.; El Abbadi, A.","Dept. of Comput.

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers.

Improving Software Performance and Reliability with an Architecture-Based Self-Adaptive Framework,Xu Zhang; Chung-Horng Lung,"Dept. of Syst. & Comput.

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate to a dynamically changing environment. The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.",0730-3157,978-1-4244-7512-4,978-0-7695-4085-6,10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339,autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture,Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers,distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability,SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability,,0,,18,,,19-23 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Model-based fault Diagnosis for IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs,Bo Yan; Guanling Chen,"Dept. of Comput.

MobiQuitous '09. 6th Annual International",20091110,2009,,,1,10,"The increasingly deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) challenge traditional network management systems because of the shared open medium and the varying channel conditions. There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.",,978-963-9799-59-2,,10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395,,Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol,fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN,IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications,,3,,34,,,13-16 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Conventional schemes place security devices (middleboxes) at a few choke points (e.g., core routers) and rely on routing policy to guarantee middlebox traversal. Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead.

This security framework involves: detection of malicious nodes by the destination node, isolation of malicious nodes by discarding the path and prevention data packets by using dispersion techniques. We propose to develop a multipath reliable routing (MRR) algorithm, which determines a set of node-disjoint reliable paths. The paths are arranged in the descending order of their reliability index. Data packets are dispersed and transmitted simultaneously through the reliable disjoint paths. The primary reliable path sends the information packet containing the transmission information. At the destination, if there is mismatch between the transmission information and the data packets received, a negative feedback is sent back to the source that includes the particulars of the affected paths. The affected paths are then removed from the list of node-disjoint paths by the source. The destination can recover the data effectively by attaining reliability, since the data packets are dispersed along multiple paths using an efficient dispersion algorithm.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE).

Redundancy Management of Multipath Routing for Intrusion Tolerance in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Al-Hamadi, H.; Ing-Ray Chen","Dept. of Comput.

The key concept of our redundancy management is to exploit the tradeoff between energy consumption vs. the gain in reliability, timeliness, and security to maximize the system useful lifetime. We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime.

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 W output power to the IOT smart nodes.

In order to provide anonymity without compromising the security, we have extended Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing Protocol(ALERT) to make it secure. The secure version is named as Secure Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing protocol (S-ALERT). S-ALERT uses Suspect Detection algorithm to choose the nodes in a route which provide unperceivable route. If there is existence of a Black Hole it actually sends a false RREP packet and advertises itself as the shortest route found.

Evaluating the impact of automated intrusion response mechanisms,"Toth, T.; Kruegel, C.","Inst. for Inf. Syst., Tech. Univ. of Vienna, Austria","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2002. Proceedings. 18th Annual",20030206,2002,,,301,310,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have reached a high level of sophistication and are able to detect intrusions with a variety of methods. Unfortunately, system administrators neither can keep up with the pace that an IDS is delivering alerts, nor can they react upon these within adequate time limits. Automatic response systems have to take over that task. In case of an identified intrusion, these components have to initiate appropriate actions to counter emerging threats. Most current intrusion response systems (IRSs) utilize static mappings to determine adequate response actions in reaction to detected intrusions. The problem with this approach is its inherent inflexibility. Countermeasures (such as changes of firewall rules) often do not only defend against the detected attack but may also have negative effects on legitimate users of the network and its services. To prevent a situation where a response action causes more damage that the actual attack, a mechanism is needed that compares the severity of an attack to the effects of a possible response mechanism. In this paper, we present a network model and an algorithm to evaluate the impact of response actions on the entities of a network. This allows the IRS to select the response among several alternatives which fulfills the security requirements and has a minimal negative effect on legitimate users.",1063-9527,0-7695-1828-1,,10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176302,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176302,,Computer bugs;Computer security;Counting circuits;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Watches;Web and internet services,security of data,IDS;IRS;automated intrusion response mechanism impact evaluation;countermeasures;emerging threats;firewall rules;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response systems;system administrators,,19,,15,,,2002,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Robust Correlation of Encrypted Attack Traffic through Stepping Stones by Flow Watermarking,"Xinyuan Wang; Reeves, D.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110314,2011,8,3,434,449,"Network-based intruders seldom attack their victims directly from their own computer. Often, they stage their attacks through intermediate stepping stones in order to conceal their identity and origin. To identify the source of the attack behind the stepping stone(s), it is necessary to correlate the incoming and outgoing flows or connections of a stepping stone. To resist attempts at correlation, the attacker may encrypt or otherwise manipulate the connection traffic. Timing-based correlation approaches have been shown to be quite effective in correlating encrypted connections. However, timing-based correlation approaches are subject to timing perturbations that may be deliberately introduced by the attacker at stepping stones. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based-correlation scheme that is designed specifically to be robust against timing perturbations. Unlike most previous timing-based correlation approaches, our watermark-based approach is active in that it embeds a unique watermark into the encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. The unique watermark that is embedded in the encrypted flow gives us a number of advantages over passive timing-based correlation in resisting timing perturbations by the attacker. In contrast to the existing passive correlation approaches, our active watermark-based correlation does not make any limiting assumptions about the distribution or random process of the original interpacket timing of the packet flow. In theory, our watermark-based correlation can achieve arbitrarily close to 100 percent correlation true positive rate (TPR), and arbitrarily close to 0 percent false positive rate (FPR) at the same time for sufficiently long flows, despite arbitrarily large (but bounded) timing perturbations of any distribution by the attacker. Our paper is the first that identifies 1) accurate quantitative tradeoffs between the achievable correlation effectiveness - nd the defining characteristics of the timing perturbation; and 2) a provable upper bound on the number of packets needed to achieve a desired correlation effectiveness, given the amount of timing perturbation. Experimental results show that our active watermark-based correlation performs better and requires fewer packets than existing, passive timing-based correlation methods in the presence of random timing perturbations.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.35,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551157,Network-level security and protection;correlation;intrusion tracing;stepping stone.,Correlation;Cryptography;Decoding;Delay;Robustness;Watermarking,cryptography;random processes;watermarking,encrypted attack traffic;false positive rate;flow watermarking;network based intruder;random timing perturbation;stepping stones;true positive rate;watermark based correlation scheme,,1,,37,,8/19/2010,May-June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Due to dynamic nature and lack of centralized monitoring points, these networks are highly vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) provide audit and monitoring capabilities that offer the local security to a node and help to perceive the specific trust level of other nodes. We take benefit of the clustering concept in MANETs for the effective communication between nodes, where each cluster involves a number of member nodes and is managed by a cluster-head. It can be taken as an advantage in these battery and memory constrained networks for the purpose of intrusion detection, by separating tasks for the head and member nodes, at the same time providing opportunity for launching collaborative detection approach. The clustering schemes are generally used for the routing purposes to enhance the route efficiency.

However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks.

An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period.

Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set). Based on ROOM, wefurther propose MP-ROOM, which is extended to well support the rules cross multiple protocol data units (PDUs) fortraffic identification.

Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit.

Lab., Berkeley, CA, USA","Security and Privacy (SP), 2010 IEEE Symposium on",20100708,2010,,,305,316,"In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational real world settings.

Accelerating DFA Construction by Hierarchical Merging,Yanbing Liu; Li Guo; Muyi Guo; Ping Liu,,"Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications (ISPA), 2011 IEEE 9th International Symposium on",20110714,2011,,,1,6,"Regular expression matching is widely used in many network applications to analyze suspicious traffic against predefined signatures, and to discover anomalous events. Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is the basic data structure to scan input traffic byte by byte. Though DFA meets the requirement of real-time processing of network traffic, constructing a combined DFA for a set of regular expression signatures is very time-consuming, especially when the signature set is large. To attack this problem, we propose new strategies to accelerate DFA construction.

DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones.

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed.

The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms.

Open Flow, a SDN standard, is currently the only standard that explicitly focuses on multi-vendor openness. Unfortunately, it only provides for traffic engineering on an integrated basis for L2-L4. The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice.

Classification of Disturbances and Cyber-Attacks in Power Systems Using Heterogeneous Time-Synchronized Data,"Shengyi Pan; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.","Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS, USA","Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on",20150602,2015,11,3,650,662,"Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults.

In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as 1 and the other is marked as 0. During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-2025-4,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612,,Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network,,9,,26,,,13-18 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls.

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time.

On Achieving Cost-Sensitive Anomaly Detection and Response in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Zonghua Zhang; Pin-han Ho; Nai&#x0308;t-Abdesselam, F.","SRC-TBN, NICT, Japan","Communications, 2009. ICC '09. IEEE International Conference on",20090811,2009,,,1,5,"In Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET), anomaly detection and response system (ADRS) plays a paramount role in diagnosing anomalous events, which are resulted by both accidental system errors and intentional attacks. While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern.

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds.

Helping TicketMaster: Changing the Economics of Ticket Robots with Geographic Proof-of-Work,"Kaiser, E.; Wu-chang Feng","Portland State Univ., Portland, OR, USA","INFOCOM IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops , 2010",20100520,2010,,,1,6,"When tickets for popular events such as Hannah Montana concerts go on sale online, they sell out almost instantly. Unfortunately, a significant number of them are purchased by world-wide networks of ticket purchasing robots run by scalpers looking to turn a quick profit. Ticket outlets currently employ CAPTCHAs to slow down fully automated purchasing robots. Since the profit associated with scalping tickets is several orders of magnitude larger than the cost associated with paying humans to solve the CAPTCHAs, this approach has been ineffective. CAPTCHAs have a fundamental flaw when used to protect online tickets: the cost to solve them using humans is fixed and small. To address this problem, this paper explores a novel alternative based on geographically-driven proof-of-work. The crux of the approach exploits the observation that most legitimate clients are located geographically close to the event. By requiring every client to solve a cryptographic puzzle whose difficulty is based on their distance to the event, ticket purchasing robots must be placed close to each event in order to monopolize the tickets. This requirement significantly increases the cost of operating such networks. Using emulation and simulation, we demonstrate the utility of our approach in tackling the online ticketing problem.",,978-1-4244-6739-6,978-1-4244-6739-6,10.1109/INFCOMW.2010.5466663,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466663,,Communications Society;Costs;Cryptography;Databases;Emulation;Humans;Marketing and sales;Protection;Robotics and automation;Robots,Internet;marketing data processing;security of data,CAPTCHA;TicketMaster;cryptographic puzzle;geographic proof-of-work;online ticket protection;scalping tickets;ticket purchasing robots,,1,,23,,,15-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM.

A number of computerized systems-including ATM networks, web servers, and intrusion detection systems-systematically track every atomic action we perform, thus generating massive streams of timestamped observation data, possibly from multiple concurrent activities. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently detecting occurrences of high-level activities from such interleaved data streams. A solution to this important problem would greatly benefit a broad range of applications, including fraud detection, video surveillance, and cyber security. There has been extensive work in the last few years on modeling activities using probabilistic models. In this paper, we propose a temporal probabilistic graph so that the elapsed time between observations also plays a role in defining whether a sequence of observations constitutes an activity. We first propose a data structure called temporal multiactivity graph to store multiple activities that need to be concurrently monitored. We then define an index called Temporal Multiactivity Graph Index Creation (tMAGIC) that, based on this data structure, examines and links observations as they occur. We define algorithms for insertion and bulk insertion into the tMAGIC index and show that this can be efficiently accomplished. We also define algorithms to solve two problems: the evidence problem that tries to find all occurrences of an activity (with probability over a threshold) within a given sequence of observations, and the identification problem that tries to find the activity that best matches a sequence of observations. We introduce complexity reducing restrictions and pruning strategies to make the problem-which is intrinsically exponential-linear to the number of observations. Our experiments confirm that tMAGI- has time and space complexity linear to the size of the input, and can efficiently retrieve instances of the monitored activities.",1041-4347,,,10.1109/TKDE.2011.246,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095553,Activity detection;indexing;stochastic automata;timestamped data,Automata;Context awareness;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Monitoring;Stochastic processes,computational complexity;computerised monitoring;data structures;graph theory;probabilistic automata;probability;stochastic automata,concurrent activity monitoring;data structure;evidence problem;high-level activity occurrence detection;identification problem;interleaved data streams;intrinsically exponential problem;space complexity;tMAGIC index;tMAGIC insertion algorithm;temporal multiactivity graph index creation;temporal multiactivity probabilistic graph;temporal stochastic automaton-based activity model indexing;time complexity;timestamped observation data streams,,3,,16,,12/6/2011,Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

Thus, in a SSO based system, robust persistent authentications and secure session termination management are vital for ensuring secure operations. In this paper we propose a novel persistent authentication technique using multiplicative attribute graph model. We use multiple attribute based persistent authentication model using facial biometrics, location and activity specific information.

Usually, the network security policy is defined as the collection of service access rules between various network zones. The specification of the security policy is often incomplete since all possible service access paths may not be explicitly covered. This policy is implemented in the network interfaces in a distributed fashion through sets of access control (ACL) rules. Formally verifying whether the distributed ACL implementation conforms to the security policy is a major requirement. The complexity of the problem is compounded as some combination of network services may lead to inconsistent hidden access paths. Further, failure of network link(s) may result in the formation of alternative routing paths and thus the existing security implementation may defy the policy. In this study, an integrated formal verification and fault analysis framework has been proposed which derives a correct ACL implementation with respect to given policy specification and also ensures that the implementation is fault tolerant to certain number of link failures. The verification incorporates boolean modelling of the security policies and ACL implementations and then formulates a satisfiability checking problem.",1751-8709,,,10.1049/iet-ifs.2009.0174,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672444,,,Boolean functions;authorisation;business communication;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;formal verification;network routing;telecommunication network topology,access control rules;alternative routing paths;boolean modelling;enterprise network;fault analysis;fault tolerant;formal approach;formal verification;hidden access paths;integrated security analysis;network interfaces;network link failure;network security policy;network topology;service access rules,,3,,,,,Dec-10,,IET,IET Journals & Magazines,

This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's many worlds theory that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services",,0-7695-2788-4,,10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882,,Checkpointing;Humans;Internet;Mission critical systems;Network servers;Telecommunications;Timing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server,Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines,Internet;VoIP;Xen based middleware;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;human intervention;many worlds theory;mission-critical telecom servers;nonvirtual state elements;reincarnation security,,0,1,10,,,19-23 March 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Research on DDoS Filtering Algorithm Based on Bloom Filter WhiteList,Dan Peng; Guiran Chang; Rui Guo; Yanjun Tang,,"MultiMedia and Information Technology, 2008. MMIT '08.

The scheme establishes the source and destination IP address database by observing the normal traffic and storages it in a Bloom Filter table. The Netflow statistics is mainly used to allocate the weights for traffic routing by routers. A new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput by the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in real network circumstances. The algorithm shows its advantages that it just occupies a small part of resources. Moreover, it can optimize the network traffic simultaneously with defending against DDoS attack, thus eliminating efficiently the global burst of traffic arising from normal traffic so as to improve greatly the efficiency of servers.",,978-0-7695-3556-2,,10.1109/MMIT.2008.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089117,DDoS attack;Genetic algorithm;Netflow;Worm,Bandwidth;Computer crime;Databases;Filtering algorithms;Filters;High-speed networks;Routing;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,filtering theory;genetic algorithms;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic,Bloom filter table;DDoS filtering algorithm;IP address database;Netflow statistics;bloom filter white list;depleted bandwidth;distributed-denial-of-service traffic;genetic algorithm;high speed network;routers;traffic flows;traffic routing,,0,,12,,,30-31 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406,amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network,Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services,,,,4,,,,,Feb. 2013,,TUP,TUP Journals & Magazines,

Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems.

This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks.

Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks).

In this paper, we show that there is a rich set of covert communication channels available to attackers for use in coordinating large scale attacks against power grids. Specifically, we present PhyCo, a novel covert channel that leverages physical substrates, e.g., line loads, within a power system, to transmit information between compromised device controllers. Using PhyCo, two compromised controllers that are miles apart can coordinate their efforts by manipulating relays to modify the power network's topology. This can be done without requiring the use of any explicit communication channels, e.g., power line communications, and can evade intrusion detection sensors aimed at overt traffic.

The Design of a Generic Intrusion-Tolerant Architecture for Web Servers,"Saidane, Ayda; Nicomette, V.; Deswarte, Y.","Dept. of Inf. & Commun. Technol., Univ. of Trento, Trento","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20090210,2009,6,1,45,58,"Nowadays, more and more information systems are connected to the Internet and offer Web interfaces to the general public or to a restricted set of users. Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2008.1,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182,Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity,,Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data,Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability,,12,,27,,2/2/2008,Jan.-March 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme.

Sleep-based Topology Control for Wakeup Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Yuanyuan Zhou; Medidi, M.","Washington State Univ., Pullman","Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2007. SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,304,313,"Wireless sensor network applications require both energy-efficiency and low latency for reporting urgent but rare events. Various wakeup scheduling schemes have been proposed to save energy by employing duty cycles and to reduce end-to-end delay by synchronizing nodes' wakeup times and shortening setup latencies. Most sensor applications incur a predominant convergecast traffic pattern in which several close-by sensor nodes simultaneously send reports to the base station, which generates spatially-correlated contention. This contention, specific to sensor networks, can significantly prolong delay, degrade throughput, and impair energy-efficiency. However, most wakeup scheduling and MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks did not address this contention and can be adversely affected. We propose a distributed topology control technique to schedule nodes' wakeup time slots, and design a MAC protocol to benefit from this topology control for improving energy-efficiency and delay, and efficiently handling spatially-correlated contention. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our topology control and MAC can either reduce the end- to-end delay by roughly half or extend the network lifetime by three times, when compared against the nearest competing approach, and achieves twice the throughput under spatially-correlated contention.",,1-4244-1268-4,1-4244-1268-4,10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292842,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292842,,Base stations;Degradation;Delay;Distributed control;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;wireless sensor networks,MAC protocol;distributed topology control;end- to-end delay;sleep-based topology control;wakeup scheduling;wireless sensor networks,,7,,28,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied.

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates.

Various techniques for passive testing on Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) exist such as by invariants and by interval determination, which are not very costy in terms of complexity but that also dont detect every errors. To improve the fault detection capabilities a backward checking method was proposed. It analyzes in a backward fashion the input/output trace from passive testing and its past. It effectively checks both the control and data portion of a protocol system and is able to detect every errors, but with a higher complexity. The purpose of the present paper is then to propose possible parallel algorithms and architectures to improve the backward passive testing approach by narrowing down its maximal time complexity and transforming it into the first real-time exhaustive passive testing approach. We present the backward algorithm and its parallel versions, study their complexity, and report results on various communication and routing protocols.",,0-7695-2552-0,,10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.167,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1628288,,Automata;Concurrent computing;Control systems;Error correction;Fault detection;Parallel algorithms;Performance evaluation;Real time systems;Routing protocols;System testing,,,,0,,14,,,23-29 April 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry, UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal-processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is near continuous wave (CW) performance in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The response from two parallel receive cables is fed to a full synchronous detection receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second.",,0-7803-8506-3,,10.1109/CCST.2004.1405387,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405387,,Coaxial cables;Communication industry;Correlators;Field programmable gate arrays;Monitoring;Radar signal processing;Sampling methods;Spread spectrum radar;Target tracking;Ultra wideband radar,alarm systems;coaxial cables;radar signal processing;safety systems;spread spectrum radar;target tracking;ultra wideband radar,100 to 200 m;11.6 m;CCTV assessment;CW leaky cable sensors;FPGA;GUIDAR technology;Golay codes;Homeland Security;amplitude response;burial depth;cable length;cable spacing;calibrated threshold;chip rate;commercial requirements;communications industry;complementary orthogonal codes;composite coded pulse response;field programmable gate array;governmental requirements;guided radar;in-phase response;industrial requirements;leaky coaxial cable technology;leaky coaxial cables;medium homogeneity;military operations;multiple range bin accumulators;multiple range bins;multiple simultaneous targets;near continuous wave;nuisance alarms;orthogonal complementary codes;parallel receive cables;pinpoint location;prisons;quadrature-phase response;radar signal processing;residential requirements;sensor sensitivity;signal-processing techniques;spread spectrum technology;synchronous detection receiver;synchronous sampling;target capture;thumbtack correlation functions;ultra high-speed digital correlator;ultra wide band radar;ultra-high speed correlation;video motion sensors,,2,,6,,,11-14 Oct. 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification.

Stealthy Attacks in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks: Detection and Countermeasure,"Khalil, I.; Bagchi, S.","Coll. of Inf. Technol., United Arab Emirates Univ., Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110620,2011,10,8,1096,1112,"Stealthy packet dropping is a suite of four attacks-misrouting, power control, identity delegation, and colluding collision-that can be easily launched against multihop wireless ad hoc networks. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.249,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538,KeywordsLocal monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.,Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication,,6,,39,,12/30/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,
Vulnerability assessment of intrusion recovery countermeasures in wireless sensor networks,"Stavrou, E.; Pitsillides, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2011 IEEE Symposium on",20110818,2011,,,706,712,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become a hot research topic in recent years and are considered to be one of the building blocks of pervasive computing. Many diverse, mission-critical applications are deployed, including military, rescue, healthcare, factory floor, and smart homes. Security is a fundamental requirement in such sensitive applications in order to ensure their reliable and stable operation. However, security is a fairly difficult task to achieve. The open nature of the wireless communication, the unrestricted deployment and limitations of WSNs and the existence of a variety of attacks threaten the security of a sensor network. Currently, research efforts have mainly focused on developing prevention and intrusion detection mechanisms in WSNs. Intrusion recovery is also an important aspect of security provisioning that is not given the same attention. Researchers have proposed intrusion recovery protocols to restore the network's operation when an attack is detected. Their designs are mostly based on simplified threat models, making the intrusion recovery countermeasures vulnerable to advanced threat models. Although the network may recover its operation after an attack is detected, it does not mean that the threat is eliminated. For example, a persistent adversary can adapt his intrusion strategy to compromise the deployed recovery countermeasure. This research work evaluates the robustness and reliability of well-known recovery countermeasures in WSNs against persistent adversaries. Evaluation results have shown that existing intrusion recovery solutions are vulnerable and can be exploited under different attack strategies in order to compromise the applied recovery countermeasures, and thus the network.

HPCC '09. 11th IEEE International Conference on",20090717,2009,,,347,353,"In recent years, worm signatures suffer from difficulties to detect polymorphic worms because these worms can change their patterns dynamically. In this paper, a class of neighborhood-relation signatures (NRS) are proposed, including 1-NRS, 2-NRS and (1,2)-NRS. NRS can be used for detecting polymorphic worms since these worms often remain the same relationship between bytes in changing their patterns. Two signature generation algorithm based on expectation-maximization (EM) and Gibbs Sampling are designed to generate NRS. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of NRS and the correctness of the process of signatures generation.

Scalable matching and ranking for network search,"Uddin, M.; Stadler, R.; Clemm, A.","ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH R.

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan.

Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based.

This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks.

By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the big-dataism. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.",,,,10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166057,,Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;XML,Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data mining;public domain software;software engineering,Amazon EC2;Big-Dataism;Eclipse;Firefox;Novell;Open Office;RedHat;cloud based computation systems;cost analysis;data processing;denial of service attacks;open source bug tracking systems;polynomial time problem;software engineering;time analysis;very large open source repository mining,,0,,24,,,23-23 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Zebu: A Language-Based Approach for Network Protocol Message Processing,"Burgy, L.; Reveillere, L.; Lawall, J.; Muller, G.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20110728,2011,37,4,575,591,"A network application communicates with other applications according to a set of rules known as a protocol. This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.",0098-5589,,,10.1109/TSE.2010.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528,Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing,Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server,Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing,ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols,,5,,34,,6/17/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

In the existing literature, the analysis of the cyber security impacts has been primarily focused from the computer science perspectives investigating potential attacking scenarios and counter-measures through network security strategies. In this paper, we investigate traffic impacts of cyber attacks considering real-world driver behavior, especially the built-in safety redundancy of the visual verification by drivers or autonomous driving system. More specifically, we study the impact of false-accident attacks on the stability of traffic flow. In the false-accident attack, a vehicle sends out a false accident alert to its surrounding vehicle through CV-enabled network and has considered an attacking scenario that has catastrophic effects. Traffic flow stability is based on widely-used numerical linear stability analysis methods, the ring road test. In such a test, vehicles are restricted within a ring road so that traffic congestion and perturbations appear in cyclic patterns indicating the stability of traffic flow. The study indicates that false-accident attacks do not necessarily yield significant impact on the stability of traffic flow.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning.

Assurance & Security, Virginia Polytech. Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, VA","Global Telecommunications Conference, 2006. GLOBECOM '06.

Unlike many existing solutions, TUF does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes an approach that is fundamentally more general. TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route.

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected.

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols.

In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family, if the machines were found to be compromised. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities. Subsequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.",,,,10.1109/ICC.2014.6883391,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883391,,Correlation;Entropy;Internet;Malware;Unsolicited electronic mail,Internet;computer network security;cryptography;entropy;fuzzy reasoning;invasive software,Internet scale infections;darknet Internet;entropy based techniques;fuzzy hashing;inference;malware infection detection;network security operators;probing activities,,0,,27,,,10-14 June 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy.

A Co-operative Approach to Thwart Selfish and Black-Hole Attacks in DTN for Post Disaster Scenario,"Gupta, A.K.; Bhattacharya, I.; Banerjee, P.S.; Mandal, J.K.","Dept. of Comput.

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.",,,,10.1109/EAIT.2014.24,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032,Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node,Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV,data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing,CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack,,0,,18,,,19-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module.

Analyzing these data, four addresses (source IP/port and destination IP/port) were abstracted to form information entropy, which was extended from thermodynamic. Based on information entropy, risk coefficient was defined to describe the whole condition of network security. To forecast the change of risk coefficient, a model was set up according to grey theory. Using a few data, the model can forecast risk coefficient accurately. Simulation and experiments were completed by MATLAB and in LAN. The experiments in LAN prove that information entropy can reflect anomaly traffic caused by DDoS attacks and Internet worms in time and effectively. The simulation by MATLAB shows that by GM(1,1) information entropy and risk coefficient can be forecasted accurately.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2.

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors.

Consequently, it is difficult to promptly select an appropriate clustering technique for investigating computer attacks and to concurrently handle the tradeoffs between interpretations and clustering of low level alerts effectively. Accordingly, alerts, attacks and corresponding countermeasures are frequently mismatched. Hence, several realistic attacks easily circumvent early detections.

Detecting attacks that exploit application-logic errors through application-level auditing,"Jingyu Zhou; Vigna, Giovanni","Dept. of Comput. Sci., California Univ., Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2004. 20th Annual",20050117,2004,,,168,178,"Host security is achieved by securing both the operating system kernel and the privileged applications that run on top of it. Application-level bugs are more frequent than kernel-level bugs, and, therefore, applications are often the means to compromise the security of a system. Detecting these attacks can be difficult, especially in the case of attacks that exploit application-logic errors. These attacks seldom exhibit characterizing patterns as in the case of buffer overflows and format string attacks. In addition, the data used by intrusion detection systems is either too low-level, as in the case of system calls, or incomplete, as in the case of syslog entries. This paper presents a technique to enforce nonbypassable, application-level auditing that does not require the recompilation of legacy systems. The technique is implemented as a kernel-level component, a privileged daemon, and an offline language tool. The technique uses binary rewriting to instrument applications so that meaningful and complete audit information can be extracted. This information is then matched against application-specific signatures to detect attacks that exploit application-logic errors.

Lightweight mobile core networks for machine type communications,"Taleb, T.; Ksentini, A.; Kobbane, A.","Aalto Univ., Espoo, Finland","Access, IEEE",20141003,2014,2,,1128,1137,"Machine type communications (MTCs) enable the communications of machines (devices) to machines over mobile networks. Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks.

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks.

They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker.

Instead, the mobile nodes forward packets to each others, allowing communication among nodes outside wireless transmission range. In this dynamic network, each node is considered as a mobile router but in an energy-conserving manner. This fact makes node an active element in the network which is able of the best and of the worst. Actually, a malicious node can easily disrupt the proper functioning of the routing by simply refusing to forward routing message (misbehavior node), inject the wrong routing packets, modifying others, etc. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol for wireless ad-hoc network based on multi-agent systems and particularly on ant behavior.

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets.

Anomaly Detection via Online Oversampling Principal Component Analysis,"Lee, Yuh-Jye; Yeh, Yi-Ren; Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank","National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei","Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20130521,2013,25,7,1460,1470,"Anomaly detection has been an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",1041-4347,,,10.1109/TKDE.2012.99,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273,Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis,Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis,,,,4,,26,,5/15/2012,Jul-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true).

Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves the chance of a transaction meeting its deadline when its progress is hampered by conflicts.",1530-0889,978-1-4244-9232-9,978-1-4244-9231-2,10.1109/DSN.2011.5958224,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958224,Contention Management;Scheduling;Transactional Memory,Games;Instruction sets;Linux;Optimized production technology;Rendering (computer graphics);Reservoirs;Runtime,Linux;concurrency control;multi-threading;scheduling;shared memory systems;transaction processing,Deadline-Aware Scheduling;Linux scheduler;Software Transactional Memory;concurrency control;conservative execution;parallel programs;thread migration;transaction execution strategy,,1,,25,,,27-30 June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

The infrastructure implements services for the transfer, execution, and protection of mobile agents. Security services are usually provided by implementing new security mechanisms that are explicitly tailored to mobile components. Unfortunately, developing sound, reliable security mechanisms is a non-trivial task, and a history of vulnerable and/or incomplete implementations of these mechanisms led to the idea that mobile code systems are inherently insecure, too complex, and very difficult to deploy. To overcome these problems, we developed a mobile code system that relies as much as possible on the security mechanisms already provided by the underlying operating system. By doing this, it is possible to develop, with reduced effort, security services that rely on well-known, well-understood, and well-tested security mechanisms. Also, by describing the security of the mobile code system in terms of the OS security mechanisms, system administrators can better evaluate the security implications of deploying the system.

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.",,,,10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694,,Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security,Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers),DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism,,0,,19,,,14-16 Oct. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

We argue that for the smart grid a more restrictive approach, that cannot be circumvented by customized malware, will increase the security level tremendously. Therefore, in this paper we present a smart white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behavior over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. The application of such a system is promising in a smart grid environment which mostly implements well-specified processes, resulting in rather predictable and static behavior.

Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed approach that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing events for early cyber attack warning and notification.",,,,10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849283,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849283,,Conferences;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Probes,IP networks;Internet;computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;information theory;invasive software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic,Internet traffic;coordination pattern;cyber attack;cyber threat intelligence;cyberspace;data mining methods;early cyber attack notification;early cyber attack warning;emergency response teams;fuzzy approaches;information theoretical metrics;large-scale orchestrated probing events;malicious activities;malicious real darknet data;malware traffic;network security analysts;orchestration pattern;routable unallocated IP addresses;signal techniques;statistical techniques,,0,,15,,,April 27 2014-May 2 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Enhancing security in CAN systems using a star coupling router,"Kammerer, R.; Fromel, B.; Wasicek, A.","Inst. for Comput.

Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based CAN are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based CAN, but are detected and contained on router-based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems.",,978-1-4673-2685-8,978-1-4673-2683-4,10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356590,,Automotive engineering;Multicast communication;Routing;Security;Software;Topology,computer network security;controller area networks;software maintenance,CAN router;CAN systems security;automotive applications;automotive domain;bus-based CAN;controller area network;denial-of-service attacks;eavesdropping;failure propagation;legacy CAN based systems;message fabrication;power train;router-based CAN;safety domain;safety-critical subsystems;star coupling router;trust model,,2,,24,,,20-22 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound.

Most of the applications in this family need to search for predefined signatures in the packet payload. Hence an important building block of these processors is string matching infrastructure. Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform.

However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient.

As to the on-line part of intrusion behavior forecast system, it employs inference engine developed in this paper to forecast intrusion behavior based on intrusion preludes and to discover forecast rules.

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding).

Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.",,978-1-4673-2433-5,,10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514,,Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors,decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks,base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary,,2,,,,,8-11 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Enhanced security scheme against Jamming attack in Mobile Ad hoc Network,"Sharma, P.; Suryawanshi, A.","Dept. of Inf. Technol., Samrat Ashok Technol.

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced. Simulation results and PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) values of each node clearly shows better network performance in case of security scheme in presence of Jamming attack.",2347-9337,,,10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012891,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012891,AOMDV;Attack;MANET;Routing;Security,Bandwidth;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security,jamming;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security,MANET;PDR;enhanced security scheme;jamming attack;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing protocol AOMDV;network topology;packet delivery ratio;security design;unauthorized packets,,0,,8,,,1-2 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

A Memory Efficient Multiple Pattern Matching Architecture for Network Security,Tian Song; Wei Zhang; Dongsheng Wang; Yibo Xue,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters.

Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must port over a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain. Finally, we also propose and evaluate a hypothesis testing approach to detect port spoofing by exploiting confusion matrix statistics.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2011.110810,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963163,domain adaptation;flow-based classification,Accuracy;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Payloads;Protocols;Servers;Training,cryptography;pattern classification;transport protocols,confusion matrix statistics;data encryption;feature based pattern recognition method;flow classification;offline network planning;online anomaly detection;private-enterprise network;tamper-resistant feature,,4,,29,,,Aug-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naive Bayes classification scheme. Experimental evaluation using the Greenberg data set yields encouraging results consisting of a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 11.78% and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 1.33%, with an average command sequence length (i.e., detection delay) of 37 commands.

In this work, we attempt to quantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key characteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the number of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree. Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. Through both mathematical analysis and simulation, we find that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98% of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with the total number of infected hosts. Next, we study the infection structure of localized-scanning and permutation-scanning worms through simulation and surprisingly find that the above observations also apply to these worms.

Using a Trust Model to Reduce False Positives of SIP Flooding Attack Detection in IMS,"Chaisamran, N.; Okuda, T.; Yamaguchi, S.","Grad. Sch. of Inf.

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.",,,,10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798,False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust,Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training,IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing,Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value,,1,,21,,,22-26 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming.

CARE: Enhancing Denial-of-Service Resilience in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Ruiliang Chen; Jung-Min Park; Snow, M.","Bradley Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Virginia Polytech. Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, VA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2006. ICCCN 2006. Proceedings.15th International Conference on",20070122,2006,,,5,10,"This paper proposes an attack-resilient routing architecture, called cross-layer active re-routing (CARE), for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and dysfunctional network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.",1095-2055,1-4244-0572-6,,10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617,,Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing,attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures,,0,,12,,,9-11 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall network behavior of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic.

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.",1083-4419,,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163,Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs),Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors,cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence),SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms,"Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated",2,,49,,2/14/2012,Jun-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

To meet the computing demands of everyday operations like Nonfunctional requirements, here we have introduced OCSA to achieve that first security, the misuse case and Attack Tree analysis posed threat and Attack Surface of any Cloud, Second scalability to overcome network traffic congestion and Denial of Service (DoS) because of rapid growth of customers and Third, Storage and Service providing consequences arise and mitigated to achieve Mobility and Virtualization.

Designing a two-level monitoring method to detect network abnormal behaviors,Soo-Yeon Ji; Seonho Choi; Dong Hyun Jeong,"Bowie State Univ., Bowie, MD, USA","Information Reuse and Integration (IRI), 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on",20150302,2014,,,703,709,"Monitoring network traffic behavior is very critical for securing computing infrastructures. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.",,,,10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958,,Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training,computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics),CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method,,0,,30,,,13-15 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

One such solution to overcome selfishly behaving nodes in wireless network is to detect and exclude them .There are several secure routing protocols to detect routing misbehavior in the direct neighborhood. In this paper, we presented an improved version of Leak detector mechanism and iterative probing mechanism to detect colluding malicious nodes, manipulations of route in wireless multi hop networks. Leak detector enables the calculation of the packet-loss ratio for the individual nodes. Iterative probing enables reliable detection of selfish nodes that drop packets in a MANET.

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns.

Security vulnerabilities and solutions for packet sampling,"Goldberg, S.; Rexford, J.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ","Sarnoff Symposium, 2007 IEEE",20080716,2007,,,1,7,"Packet sampling supports a range of Internet measurement applications including characterizing the spatial flow of traffic through a network for traffic engineering purposes, identifying the flows utilizing a link for billing purposes or for intrusion detection, and monitoring end-to-end data-path quality. However, packet-sampling mechanisms must be robust to adversarial hosts that craft packet streams that are disproportionately selected by a packet sampler. For example, a botnet flooding a network with packets in a denial-of-service attack, or a greedy customer trying to avoid being billed for network utilization, each have a strong incentive to craft packet streams that evade selection by the packet sampler. In this paper, we focus on securing the passive packet sampling mechanisms recommended by PSAMP (the IETF Packet Sampling working group [1]) against adversarial hosts. We show that (1) some of the packet sampling techniques suggested in current drafts of the PSAMP charter have security vulnerabilities, (2) secure uncoordinated sampling can be achieved using random sampling with a cryptographic random number generator, and (3) secure coordinated sampling requires a cryptographic pseudorandom function, keyed with a secret key that should be changed each time the sampler leaks information to the hosts.",,978-1-4244-2483-2,,10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567339,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567339,,Cryptography;Data engineering;Data security;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;cryptography;random processes;sampling methods;telecommunication traffic,Internet measurement application;cryptographic pseudorandom function;cryptographic random number generator;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end data-path quality;intrusion detection;packet sampling;security vulnerability;telecommunication traffic,,0,3,9,,,April 30 2007-May 2 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Impact of Sanitized Message Flows in a Cooperative Intrusion Warning System,"Tolle, J.; Jahnke, M.; Felde, N.G.; Martini, P.","Res. Establ. for Appl. Sci., Wachtberg","Military Communications Conference, 2006. MILCOM 2006. IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,7,"This paper discusses the side effects of sanitizing IT security event messages in a cooperative multi-domain intrusion warning system (IWS). To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow",,1-4244-0617-X,1-4244-0618-8,10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733,,Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology,Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security,IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities,,1,1,17,,,23-25 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
Effective Statistical Detection of Smart Confidentiality Attacks in Multi-Domain Networks,"Gharbaoui, M.; Paolucci, F.; Giorgetti, A.; Martini, B.; Castoldi, P.","TeCIP Inst., Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy","Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions on",20131211,2013,10,4,383,397,"The need to preserve information confidentiality among network providers has prevented the actual deployment of effective Traffic Engineering (TE) solutions for QoS-enabled end-to-end connectivity services in multi-domain multi-provider networks. The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions.

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet.

Towards Intelligent Cross Protocol Intrusion Detection in the Next Generation Networks based on Protocol Anomaly Detection,"Barry, B.I.A.; Chan, H.A.","Dept. of Electr.

Detecting attacks based on information taken from a single protocol or a group of protocols at a certain layer results in a high rate of false positives or false negatives. In this paper, we introduce a new cross protocol design for IDSs in the NGNs based on protocol anomaly detection. Our design aims at correlating various detection results from the protocols involved in a session, both, horizontally and vertically. By horizontal correlation we aim at monitoring sessions taking place within a single layer of the protocol stack, whereas, vertical correlation addresses sessions taking place across multiple protocol layers. In addition, our design is supported by intelligent mechanism based on fuzzy logic to help the system reduce the rate of false alarms which is relatively high in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems.

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed.

This paper presents a stat- based approach to measuring intrusion impacts on the basis of IDS reports, and analyzing costs and benefits of response polices supposed to be taken. Specifically, assuming the system evolves as a Markov process conditioned upon the current system state, imperfect observation and action, a partially observable Markov decision process to model the efficacy of IDSs (as well as alert correlation technology) as providing a probabilistic assessment of the state of system assets, and to maximize rewards (cost and benefit) by taking appropriate actions in response to the estimated states.

Topology adaptation for robust ad hoc cyberphysical networks under puncture-style attacks,"Liu, Y.; Trappe, W.","Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA",Tsinghua Science and Technology,20150803,2015,20,4,364,375,"Many cyber physical networks will involve ad hoc deployments utilizing peer-to-peer communications. Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452,Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation,Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology,,,,0,,,,,Aug-15,,TUP,TUP Journals & Magazines,

However, the remote sensing image data's usage rate still remains very low. To solve this problem, we propose a new Service model: Anytime-Anywhere Service (AAService) model, under which users can get remote sensing images anytime and anywhere. Then we implemented and tested our AA-Service System based on this Service model. First of all, we introduced the framework of the AA-Service System. The AAService System includes three units: Data Center, Communication Unit, and User Unit; and provides three kinds of Services: image Service, plotting Service, and update Service. The features of the AA-Service are seamless coverage, all online Service, and efficient distribution. Secondly, we also described the three key technologies of the AA-Service System in this paper: distributing data according to the users' needs, updating remote sensing image partially and transmitting data in an efficient way. In the AA-Service System, the remote sensing image is organized by the global subdivision compression pyramid which enables the System to distribute remote sensing images of different resolution to users according to the users' requests. When the remote sensing image is changing, the System only updates the changed area rather than the whole image. This is different from other image Service models which distribute remote sensing images by scene or map sheet. In addition, this System ensures reliable and efficient data transmission by integrating three communication methods: BeiDou communication, CDMA communication and Internet communication, and using a new packet loss retransmission mechanism. Thirdly, we listed the statistics data of the System test. In the System test, we measured the Qos and consumed time of image Service, plotting Service and update Service respectively. The results show that this AA-Service System can provide the remote sen- - sing images Service anytime and anywhere in a short time and in a good Qos. By using this AA-Service System, the remote sensing image data's usage rate will be increased and users can experience more convenient remote sensing images Service in their daily life.",,978-1-4244-7301-4,,10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567681,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567681,AA-Service;Global Subdivision Compression Pyramid;Packet loss retransmission Mechanism;Partial-Image Updates;remote sensing images,Computational modeling;Data models;Databases;Image resolution;Internet;Receivers;Remote sensing,Internet;code division multiple access;data communication;geographic information systems;image processing;quality of service;remote sensing;statistical analysis,AA-Service system;AAService model;BeiDou communication;CDMA communication;Internet communication;QoS;all online service;anytime-anywhere-service system;communication unit;data center;data transmission;global subdivision compression pyramid;image service;packet loss retransmission mechanism;plotting service;remote sensing image data;remote sensing technology;seamless coverage;statistics data;update service;user unit,,0,,12,,,18-20 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes.

Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on",20041101,2004,,,206,215,"Future distributed systems may include large self-organizing networks of locally communicating sensor nodes, any small number of which may be subvened by an adversary. Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust.

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels.

Third International Conference on",20050801,2005,2,,214,219,This paper presents a model for real-time network monitoring and anomaly detection that provides a holistic view of network conversation exchanges. We argue that monitoring and anomaly detection are necessary mechanisms for ensuring secure and dependable network computing infrastructure. The model for network traffic exchange is based on a modified Ehrenfest urn model and combines statistical physics and queuing theory to provide macrostate descriptions of complex networked systems when the exact microstate parameters of each element in the system precludes global understanding from first principles.

In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor). The proposed covert channel, for which we coin the term OverCovert, is based on the common return-to-libc stack-overflow attack and the address space layout randomization defense.

RAD: a compile-time solution to buffer overflow attacks,Tzi-cker Chiueh; Fu-Hau Hsu,"Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents a compiler-based solution to the notorious buffer overflow attack problem. Using this solution, users can prevent attackers from compromising their systems by changing the return address to execute injected code, which is the most common method used in buffer overflow attacks. Return address defender (RAD) is a simple compiler patch that automatically creates a safe area to store a copy of return addresses and automatically adds protection code into applications that it compiles to defend programs against buffer overflow attacks. Using it to protect a program does not need to modify the source code of the protected programs. Moreover, RAD does not change the layout of stack frames, so binary code it generated is compatible with existing libraries and other object files. Empirical performance measurements on a fully operational RAD prototype show that programs protected by RAD only experience a factor of between 1.01 to 1.31 slow-down. In this paper we present the principle of buffer overflow attacks, a taxonomy of defense methods, the implementation details of RAD, and the performance analysis of the RAD prototype",,0-7695-1077-9,,10.1109/ICDSC.2001.918971,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918971,,Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Libraries;Measurement;Program processors;Protection;Prototypes;Taxonomy,program compilers;security of data,RAD;arbitrary programs;binary code;buffer overflow attacks;compile-time solution;compiler patch;network-attached computer system;return address defender;security;stack frames,,37,6,26,,,Apr-01,16 Apr 2001-19 Apr 2001,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on traditional graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-4148-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781,,Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic,cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic,,1,,21,,,Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

In this position paper, we aim to investigate the general handoff problem in face of multiple heterogeneous wireless interfaces and non-trivial node mobility. This becomes ever important, since wireless heterogeneity will persist and nodes in military ad hoc networks are bound to move beyond rare-and-slow scenarios.

Traditional layout methods create the network graph with overwhelming visual clutter, which hinders the network understanding and traffic analysis tasks. The existing graph simplification algorithms (e.g. community-based clustering) can effectively reduce the visual complexity, but lead to less meaningful traffic representations. In this paper, we introduce a new method to the traffic monitoring and anomaly analysis of large networks, namely Structural Equivalence Grouping (SEG). Based on the intrinsic nature of the computer network traffic, SEG condenses the graph by more than 20 times while preserving the critical connectivity information.

Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods.

Amber: A zero-interaction honeypot and network enforcer with modular intelligence,"Schoeman, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Rhodes Univ., Grahamstown, South Africa","Information Security for South Africa, 2013",20131021,2013,,,1,7,"For the greater part, security controls are based around the principle of Decision through Detection (DtD). The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer. Empirical testing has been done proving the usefulness of this alternative and low cost approach in defending networks.

Anomaly detection in networks is of interest from two perspectives: an organization's perspective and an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) perspective. Protection of its computer network infrastructure is an important task for all organizations. Organizations desire that their networks are robust and resilient to any kind of attack. Anomaly detection forms an important part of this network resiliency. Also the ISPs want to maximize the utilization of their resources. Hence an ISP would be interested to know any resource failure immediately so as to correct the problem. ISPs would also be interested in safeguarding their network from malicious activities. We describe here a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based traffic verification system as a paradigm for network anomaly detection. The traffic characteristics aggregated over a period of time is given to the model to verify the validity of the traffic.

Stream-Oriented Network Traffic Capture and Analysis for High-Speed Networks,"Papadogiannakis, A.; Polychronakis, M.; Markatos, E.P.","Inst. of Comput.

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries.

Curve-based planar graph routing with guaranteed delivery in multihop wireless networks,"Frey, H.; Hollick, M.; Loch, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints such as network congestion, limited node energy levels, or non-cooperation of nodes might severely impact the performance and the robustness of existing planar graph routing variants. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We investigate basic schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network, and derive algorithms for routing and forwarding along these curves. We analytically prove that our scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery in arbitrary planar connected graphs. We implement curve-based routing and show its feasibility by means of a simulation study. As a proof-of-concept scenario, we investigate the case of non-cooperating nodes.

However, malicious nodes in a wireless and mobile ad hoc environment can jeopardize the security of the network if the issues of secure data exchange are not properly handled. Encryption cannot fully protect the data communicated between nodes, as routing information may expose the identities of the communicating nodes and put their relationships at risk. In this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous routing protocol that uses a mobile agent paradigm for wireless and mobile ad hoc networks. In our protocol, only trustworthy nodes are allowed to participate in communications and the misbehavior of malicious nodes is thus prevented effectively.

Recent safety norms (for example, ISO 26262) thus prescribe the use of safety models for both hardware and software. However, failure rates or probabilities for software are difficult to justify. Only if developers take good design decisions from the outset will they achieve safety goals efficiently. To support safety-oriented navigation of the design space and to bridge the existing gap between qualitative analyses for software and quantitative ones for hardware, we propose a fault-tree-based approach to the safety analysis of software-controlled systems. Assigning intervals instead of fixed values to events and using Monte-Carlo sampling, probability mass functions of failure probabilities are derived.

Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected.

We have been exploring deliberate deception in defensive tactics by information systems under cyber-attack as during information warfare. We have developed a tool to systematically counterplan or find ways to foil a particular attack plan. Our approach is to first find all possible atomic ploys that can interfere with the plan. Ploys are simple deceits the operating system can do such as lying about the status of a file. We analyze ploys as to the degree of difficulty they cause to the plan wherever they can be applied. We then formulate a counterplan by selecting the most cost-effective set of ploys and assign appropriate presentation methods for them, taking into account the likelihood that, if we are not careful, the attacker will realize they are being deceived and will terminate our game with them. The counterplan can be effected by a modified operating system. We have implemented our counterplanner in a tool MECOUNTER that uses multiagent planning coupled with some novel inference methods to efficiently find a best counterplan.

PSCE '06. 2006 IEEE PES",20070205,2006,,,641,649,"Ethernet-based local area networks (LANs) have become an indispensable tool that promises to revolutionize power system communications. Recent advances in Ethernet-based technology have taken this industry from shared 10 Mbps LAN segments to switched 100 Mbps LANs followed by 1 Gbps backbones for metropolitan area networks (MANs) and more recently 10 Gbps Ethernet technology for use in wide-area networks (WANs). Up until now, intersubstation communications typically have been provided by a SONET/SDH communication infrastructure. Although well understood and widely deployed, this legacy approach is not optimized for data traffic and requires protocol mapping and/or translation at both ends of the interface. The more recent trend of migrating towards voice over IP services combined with the advent of low-cost gigabit Ethernet switches and low-cost long-haul fiber optics has made it possible to deploy native Ethernet networks in wide-area applications. This paper looks at the new capabilities in substation automation, protection, and control made possible by native intersubstation Ethernet. Analysis is made of the current capabilities of this technology and state of the art tools available for Ethernet network management.

The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism.

International Symposium on",20081014,2008,,,49,54,"Wireless sensor networks, applied for monitoring physical environments, have recently emerged as an important application of the ad hoc networks paradigm. Low processing power and wireless connectivity make such networks vulnerable to various types of attacks. The dense deployment of sensors along with the protocol deficiencies, make broadcast attacks feasible. The current solutions for these types of attacks are mainly cryptographic and suffer from either heavy computational complexity or lack of mobility support. In this paper we propose an energy efficient method to fortify sensor networks against broadcast attacks using some key features of such networks like small transmission range and low reception-sensitivity. The main idea relies on modifying the reply timings of current MAC sub-layer protocols and embedding a two or three-way handshake protocol in broadcast scenarios so that the adversary receives a negative feedback from the network in response to his greediness in infecting nodes.

Tested systems included the BlueView ProViewer P450E-15, BlueView ProViewer P900E-20, and RESON SeaBat 7128, which were chosen for the good balance of resolution and range provided by their frequency of operation (450 kHz, 900 kHz, and 400 kHz, respectively) revealed during a prior study. Video clips were recorded from these systems while observing swimmers, open-circuit scuba divers, and closed-circuit rebreather divers in a marine harbor in St. Petersburg, FL. Clips were randomized and presented to 18 volunteer evaluators who were asked to identify which clips contained divers and which did not. The highest scoring system also had the highest operating frequency. However, the same high-scoring sonar in a different configuration scored similar to the system with the lowest frequency. This indicates that signal frequency, and therefore image resolution, is not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. After noticing many evaluators performed poorly with cluttered clips or clips with low acoustic target strength, results were recalculated to remove swimmers and surface swim routes such that only uncluttered, clearly-reflecting targets were included. Some sonar scores were moderately improved by this change, while others significantly decreased. This indicated that target clarity is also not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. Further analysis is recommended to reveal all major factors affecting assessment to maximize quality and eventually bring underwater security assessment to a high level.",,978-1-4244-4332-1,,10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664320,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664320,,Acoustic beams;Acoustics;Book reviews;Humans;Imaging;Security;Sonar,sonar imaging;underwater acoustic communication,high security underwater assessment;human recognizable images;imaging sonars;preliminary evaluation;surface swim routes,,0,,1,,,20-23 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them.

A property oriented fault detection approach for link state routing protocol,"Feiyi Wang; Fengmin Gong; Wu, F.S.","MCNC, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2000. Proceedings. Ninth International Conference on",20020806,2000,,,114,119,"This paper proposes a new approach to fault detection for a link state routing system-property oriented analysis and detection (POD). A routing system is modeled as a set of distributed processes. A property is defined as state predicate(s) over system variables. For the link state routing protocol, the high-level overall converging property P is defined as the synchronization among routing information bases maintained by all processes. We decompose the routing protocol into different computation phases. For each phase, we use invariant state predicates (safety property) and the liveness property as our guide for observation and analysis. The goal of the detection algorithm is to construct a validation path based on the history to determine if the fault is natural or malicious once the stable property P is rendered invalid by faults. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, a new detection approach is proposed that differs from traditional signature-based or profile-based intrusion detection paradigms in the sense that it utilizes the stable property as a starting point, and correlates the history and future to validate changes in the system; second, by exploring the primary concerned system properties, we show that detection effort can be conducted in a more focused and systematic fashion",1095-2055,0-7803-6494-5,,10.1109/ICCCN.2000.885479,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885479,,ARPANET;Computer science;Costs;Detection algorithms;Fault detection;History;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Safety;Topology,authorisation;computer network management;computer network reliability;protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication network routing,distributed processes;fault detection;intrusion detection;invariant state predicates;link state routing protocol;liveness property;malicious fault;natural fault;property oriented analysis;safety property;synchronization;system variables;validation path,,1,,17,,,2000,16 Oct 2000-18 Oct 2000,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers.

Network-based and Attack-resilient Length Signature Generation for Zero-day Polymorphic Worms,Zhichun Li; Lanjia Wang; Yan Chen; Zhi Fu,"Northwestern Univ., Evanston","Network Protocols, 2007.

IEEE International Conference on",20071105,2007,,,164,173,"It is crucial to detect zero-day polymorphic worms and to generate signatures at the edge network gateways or honeynets so that we can prevent the worms from propagating at their early phase. However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.",,978-1-4244-1588-5,978-1-4244-1588-5,10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847,,Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic,invasive software;telecommunication security,attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature,,12,,40,,,16-19 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

This attacker-driven anti-malware testing is something defenders would ideally want to limit. Given that anti-malware products must be widely distributed to be commercially viable, it is not feasible to prevent attackers from running them. Here we examine whether it may be possible to instead limit the effectiveness of attacker tests. Specifically, we present a game-theoretic model of anti-malware testing where detection timeliness and coverage are parameters that can be adjusted by anti-malware providers. The less coverage and the slower the response, the harder it is for attackers to determine whether their malware will be detected-and the less protection the software provides to hosts running the anti-malware software. While our results are preliminary, they suggest that it is clearly non-optimal for anti-malware vendors to simply maximize coverage and detection time. As we explain, this result has significant implications for product design and (non-malicious) anti-malware testing methodologies.",,,,10.1109/WATeR.2014.7015755,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015755,,Computers;Game theory;Games;Malware;Software;Testing,invasive software;product design,antimalware products;antimalware software;attacker-driven antimalware testing;detection coverage;detection timeliness;game-theoretic model;malware author testing challenge;product design,,0,,16,,,23-23 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Proceedings IEEE,20050822,2005,4,,2372,2382 vol. 4,"Client puzzles have been proposed in a number of protocols as a mechanism for mitigating the effects of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.",0743-166X,0-7803-8968-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523,,Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services,IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic,DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols,,14,28,56,,,13-17 March 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives.

Signature Tree Generation for Polymorphic Worms,Yong Tang; Bin Xiao; Xicheng Lu,"Coll. of Comput., Nat.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined more specific relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2010.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493,Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation,,digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures,NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering,,7,,36,,6/17/2010,Apr-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,

The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one. The scheme protects AS from DoS as hash calculations for detection of DoS are done once only.

In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients.

Data forensic techniques using Benford's law and Zipf's law for keystroke dynamics,"Iorliam, A.; Ho, A.T.S.; Poh, N.; Tirunagari, S.; Bours, P.","Dept. of Comput., Univ. of Surrey, Guildford, UK","Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF), 2015 International Workshop on",20150521,2015,,,1,6,"The selection and application of biometrics traits for authentication and identification have recently attracted a significant amount of research interest. In this paper we investigate the use of keystroke data to distinguish between humans using keystroke biometric systems and non-humans for auditing application. Recently, Benford's Law and Zipf's Law, which are both discrete Power law probability distributions, have been effectively used to detect fraud and discriminate between genuine data and fake/tampered data. As such, our motivation is to apply the Benford's Law and Zipf's Law on keystroke data and to determine whether they follow these laws and discriminate between humans using keystroke biometric systems from non-humans. From the results, we observe that, the latency values of the keystroke data from humans actually follow the Benford's law and Zipf's law, but not the duration values. This implies that, latency values from humans would follow the two laws, whereas the latency values from non-humans would deviate from the Benford's law and Zipf's law. Even though, the duration values from humans deviates from the Benford's law, they do follow a pattern that we can develop an accurate model for the duration values. We perform experiments using the benchmark data set developed by Killourhy and Maxion, CMU [1] and obtain divergences of 0.0008, 0.029 and 0.05 for the keyup-keydown (latency), keydown-keydown, and duration of the keystroke data, respectively. Moreover, P-value's of 0.7770, 0.6230 and 0.0160 are obtained for the keyup-keydown (latency), keydown-keydown, and duration of the keystroke data, respectively.

Unfortunately, many applications of visualization technology fall short of expectations because the technology is used inappropriately - the wrong tool applied in the wrong way. A study of visualization techniques as applied to one particularly demanding area, information assurance, leads to the conclusion that there is a proper and formal way to approach designing visualization techniques for maintaining situational awareness in complex domains. Visualization techniques should be specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three identified stages of situational awareness - perception, comprehension, or projection -and with one of five standard uses of visualization - monitoring, inspecting, exploring, forecasting, or communicating. Greater value can be realized by selecting the right visualization technique to focus on each operational task, rather than searching for a single all-encompassing solution to fit every need.

When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable.

An attacker can use any SIP request to launch a flooding attack, leading to severe consequences at either client or server side SIP elements or both of them. In this context, end user's devices are considered more vulnerable to flooding attacks due to their limited capabilities. In this paper, we focus on INVITE flooding attack for which we propose a simple and robust detection scheme. This scheme prevents an attacker from launching an INVITE flood through a transition state table used by the proxy to analyse the incoming INVITE requests and exclude the suspicious ones. Our scheme requires also that the end-user keeps track of the time and IP addresses of each incoming request. Furthermore, we modify the header of the REGISTER request by adding a new field named Critical number which holds the value of maximum number of users or callers that could easily be handled by the end user. Unlike the existing solutions, our scheme does not require any special detection device or firewall at the SIP server. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in SIP Express Router (SER) and the obtained results have confirmed its effectiveness.",,978-1-4673-5615-2,978-1-4673-5614-5,10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549057,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549057,Denial of Service;INVITE Flooding Attack;Security;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),Computer crime;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers;Time factors,IP networks;Internet telephony;computer network security;network servers;routing protocols;signalling protocols;video communication,INVITE flooding attack;IP address;Internet;REGISTER request header;SER;SIP express router;SIP server;critical number;firewall;incoming INVITE request analysis;lightweight countermeasure;robust detection scheme;robust security mechanism;session initiation protocol;transition state table;video communication;voice communication,,0,,13,,,23-25 April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Consequently, there are growing rate of computer attacks despite the inclusion of network detectors on the networks. Therefore, this paper presents a model to investigate these problems.

The OLD is similar to an identifying code, but for an open neighborhood instead of closed. The OLD was introduced by Peter Slater and Suk J. Seo in 2010 as a method by which one could identify the location of an event at a node where a node in the set can detect events at adjacent nodes, but cannot detect an event at itself. This is perhaps more clear as a series of factories such that those with intrusion detection devices form an identifying code, but an intruder will disable the system at the factory into which she breaks, if so equipped. There are also applications in other areas such as router networks. This paper continues work by Alison Oldham at the College of William and Mary on the development and implementation of an ILP to identify such OLDs on finite graphs. We demonstrate and compare the results on 100 node randomly generated graphs of various constructions; Erdos-Renyi, Geometric and Scale-Free. We find that most graphs have a density near 1/3. We also explore the use of the ILP to generate OLDs for infinite grids, looking specifically at the hexagonal-triangular grid where we discover a new upper bound of 5/12 on the minimum density OLD for this grid.

In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed.

We propose a parallel clustering technique followed by usage of evolutionary computing comprising of genetic algorithm and Hill climbing to optimize the clusters formed. Rules are generated by analyzing each individual clusters formed. The proposed system was specifically developed with a view to generate rule set for Snort based IDS efficiently.

To this end, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed to detect these attacks. In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network.

However, sophisticated attackers attempt to disable the IDS before they launch a thorough attack. Therefore, to accomplish its function, an IDS should have some mechanism to guarantee uninterrupted detection service even in the face of IDS component failures due to attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion-tolerant mechanism for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) that employ multiple independent components. The mechanism monitors the detection units and the hosts on which the units reside and enables the IDS to survive component failure due to intrusions. As soon as a failed IDS component is discovered, a copy of the component is installed to replace it and the detection service continues.

Di-Sec: A distributed security framework for heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Valero, M.; Sang Shin Jung; Uluagac, A.S.; Yingshu Li; Beyah, R.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Georgia State Univ., Atlanta, GA, USA","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,585,593,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are deployed for monitoring in a range of critical domains (e.g., health care, military, critical infrastructure). Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801,Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security,Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks,encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks,,6,,17,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

Application-level survivability, the ability to reconfigure an application to transparently maintain services when part of a system becomes unavailable, is the most flexible and comprehensive approach to supporting mission fulfillment since it can provide assurance over all lower layers within a networked system. We have developed resumable FTP, an application based on RFC 959, which has the ability to resume the download of a file after the download has been interrupted by users or by lower layers (loss of connection). FTP continues to be the most common method for bulk data transfer across networks and as high-performance network infrastructures have become established, default implementations of FTP have not kept pace.

The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to automated response called the Response and Recovery Engine (RRE). Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.",,978-1-4244-4422-9,978-1-4244-4421-2,10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307,,Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty,Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics),Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game,,21,2,28,,,June 29 2009-July 2 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

It is hard to find an IP packet that has not passed over an Ethernet segment. One important reason for this is Ethernet's simplicity and ease of configuration. However, Ethernet has always been known to be an insecure technology. Recent successful malware attacks and the move towards cloud computing in data centers demand that attention be paid to the security aspects of Ethernet. In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities.

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly).

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths.

State-of-the-art IDS produce voluminous alerts, most false alarms, and function mainly by recognizing the signatures of known attacks so that novel attacks slip past them. Attempts have been made to create systems that recognize the signature of normal, in the hope that they will then detect attacks, known or novel. These systems are often confounded by the extreme variability of nominal behavior. The paper describes an experiment with an IDS composed of a hierarchy of neural networks (NN) that functions as a true anomaly detector. This result is achieved by monitoring selected areas of network behavior, such as protocols, that are predictable in advance. While this does not cover the entire attack space, a considerable number of attacks are carried out by violating the expectations of the protocol/operating system designer. Within this focus, the NNs are trained using data that spans the entire normal space. These detectors are able to recognize attacks that were not specifically presented during training.

However, the deployment scenarios, the functionality requirements, and the limited capabilities of these networks expose them to a wide-range of attacks against control traffic (such as wormholes, Sybil attacks, rushing attacks, etc). In this paper we propose a lightweight protocol called DICAS that mitigates these attacks by detecting, diagnosing, and isolating the malicious nodes. DICAS uses as a fundamental building block the ability of a node to oversee its neighboring nodes communication. On top of DICAS, we build a secure routing protocol, LSR, which in addition supports multiple node-disjoint paths. We analyze the security guarantees of DICAS and use ns-2 simulations to show its effectiveness against three representative attacks.

The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes.

Ploys are simple deceits the operating system can do such as lying about the status of a file. We analyze ploys as to the degree of difficulty they cause to the plan wherever they can be applied. We then formulate a counterplan by selecting the most cost-effective set of ploys and assign appropriate presentation methods for them, taking into account the likelihood that, if we are not careful, the attacker will realize they are being deceived and terminate our game with them. The counterplan can be effected by a modified operating system.

The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain.

A Novel Method for Network Anomaly Detection Using Superstatistics,Dong Chen; Hanping Hu; Zuxi Wang; Jianghang Chen,"Inst. for Pattern Recognition & Artificial Intell., Huazhong Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Wuhan","Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems, 2008. CISIS 2008. International Conference on",20080822,2008,,,595,598,"To detect the anomalous events in the time series we propose a new idea that we can view the time series of traffic flows as a nonstationary Poisson process associated with superstatistics theory. According to the superstatistics theory, the complex dynamic system may have a large fluctuationary of intensive quantities on large time scales which causes the system to behave as nonstationarity and nonlinearity which are also the characteristics of network traffic flows. This new idea provides us a novel way to partition the nonstationary traffic time series into small stationary segments which can be modeled by Poisson distribution in sub-second time scales. Different segments follow Poisson distribution with different distribution parameters which are named slow changing parameter compared to the fast changing traffic flows and the series of distribution parameter follows certain distribution too.

A lightweight hybrid security framework for wireless sensor networks,"Sedjelmaci, H.; Senouci, S.M.","DRIVE Lab., Univ. of Bourgogne, Nevers, France","Communications (ICC), 2014 IEEE International Conference on",20140828,2014,,,3636,3641,"On the one hand, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have shown their ability to detect internal and external attacks with a high accuracy. On the other hand, cryptography techniques have proved their ability to assure the privacy of communication, i.e. data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected.

Detection of Bot Infected PCs Using Destination-Based IP and Domain Whitelists During a Non-Operating Term,"Takemori, K.; Nishigaki, M.; Takami, T.; Miyake, Y.","KDDI R&D Labs.

These attacks are considered to be sent from bot infected PCs. As a bot communicates with a malicious controller over an encrypted channel and updates its code frequently, it becomes difficult to detect infected personal computers (PCs) using pattern-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and antivirus systems (AVs). As sending attack and control packets from the bot process are independent of the user operation, a behavior monitor is effective to detect an anomaly communication. In this paper, we propose a bot detection technique that checks outbound packets with destination-based whitelists. If any outbound packets during the non-operating term do not match the whitelists, the PC is considered to be infected by the bot. The whitelists are a set of a destination IP address and/or domain names (DNs) that are listed by monitoring outbound packets from an un-infected PC. Because the many IPs and DNs are grouped into a few sub-networks and superior DNs, it is easier to maintain the destination-based whitelists than the pattern-based IDS/AV.

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host.

VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination.

Extended thymus action for improving response of AIS based NID system against malicious traffic,"Shafiq, M.Z.; Kiani, M.; Hashmi, B.; Farooq, M.","Nat.

IEEE Congress on",20080107,2007,,,3369,3376,"Artificial immune systems (AISs) are being increasingly utilized to develop network intrusion detection (NID) systems. The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives.

Detection of Resource-Drained Attacks on SIP-Based Wireless VoIP Networks,Jin Tang; Yong Hao; Yu Cheng; Chi Zhou,"Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Illinois Inst. of Technol., Chicago, IL, USA","Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010), 2010 IEEE",20110110,2010,,,1,5,"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been widely used in VoIP for session control and management. As the basic SIP specifications do not require the proxy servers to track the states of established sessions, an extension header field Session-Expires has been proposed for SIP to allow the proxy server to hold resources for established sessions just within the specified periods. In this paper, we identify a novel denial of service (DoS) attack utilizing this SIP extension to drain resources of the proxy servers in wireless VoIP. In particular, by deliberately setting a large value of the Session-Expires'' header and then physically disconnecting from the wireless network, attackers can repeatedly hold resources of the proxy server as long as they want. Also, the low-volume nature of the attack allows it to avoid being detected by existing volume-based intrusion detection systems. As a counter-measure, we propose a robust detection scheme based on the statistical Anderson-Darling test. The key insight that leads to the scheme is the changed statistical property of the header values induced by the attack. We validate the performance through computer simulation. The scheme shows its ability to detect the attack and is even more effective when applied against the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684028,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684028,,Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Robustness;Servers;Wireless networks,Internet telephony;signalling protocols;statistical testing;telecommunication security,DDoS attack;SIP-based wireless VoIP network;Session Initiation Protocol;attack detection;distributed denial of service attack;proxy server;resource-drained attack;session control;session management;session-expires;statistical Anderson-Darling test;statistical property;volume-based intrusion detection system,,2,,12,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,
A novel scaleable architecture for intrusion detection and mitigation in switched networks,"Witzke, E.L.; Tarman, T.D.; Ghosh, S.; Woodard, G.","Adv. Networking Integration Dept., Sandia Nat. Labs., Albuquerque, NM, USA",MILCOM 2002. Proceedings,20030225,2002,1,,395,399 vol.1,"High-speed, switched networks present scalability challenges to a network intrusion detection system, both in terms of the volume of data that must be analyzed, and the extent to which sensors must be inserted into the switched network to achieve comprehensive visibility. An architecture that uses a single point for intrusion assessment would quickly become overwhelmed with incoming event data from intrusion sensors that are deployed on even a moderate number of high-speed links. This is particularly true if an earnest attack (generating many events in a short period of time) is underway. The authors propose a novel architecture that hierarchically distributes the assessment function into two assessment categories - tactical assessment, and strategic assessment. The tactical assessment function provides low-level event correlation and decision making for a small sub-network (e.g., a department LAN, an ATM switch peer group, etc.), and is capable of providing fast, real-time response when millisecond response times are required due to network attacks. The strategic assessment function, on the other hand, implements high-level event correlation, which is useful when a larger view of the network is required (e.g., for low intensity or distributed attacks). The tactical assessment engines interface to the strategic assessment engine by, filtering and summarizing low-level events, ensuring that the strategic assessment engine's workload remains manageable. This paper describes the distributed intrusion assessment architecture in more detail, presents a few application scenarios that benefit from hierarchical attack assessment, and summarizes ongoing work in developing prototype components for this architecture.",,0-7803-7625-0,,10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1180474,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180474,,Asynchronous transfer mode;Decision making;Delay;Engines;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Scalability;Sensor systems;Switches,asynchronous transfer mode;correlation methods;local area networks;packet switching;security of data;telecommunication security,ATM networks;ATM switch peer group;decision making;department LAN;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion assessment architecture;event data;filtering;high-level event correlation;high-speed links;high-speed switched networks;intrusion mitigation;intrusion sensors;low intensity attacks;low-level event correlation;network architecture;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;real-time response;scaleable architecture;strategic assessment engine;sub-network;tactical assessment engines,,3,,6,,,7-10 Oct. 2002,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,

However, this approach works only if there is a stable base profile representing the legitimate network traffic. Although there has been some preliminary research, the details of profiling, such as the profile format, its size and the traffic stability by site or time, have not been widely available. In this study, we analyze actual traffic traces from two Internet traffic archives and verify the traffic stability by various aspects. The analysis shows that there are significant differences in the traffic patterns among different sites. In addition, there are some differences between different time of day or different days, even within a site, suggesting that different profiles are needed for different times.

There is a need to automate their detection by observing their malicious footprints over network streams. In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets.

One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)).

We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory.
