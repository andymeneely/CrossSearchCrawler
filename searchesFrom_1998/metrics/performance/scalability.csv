While using SDN, enterprises and the research sector have encountered many challenges related to security and exposed weaknesses in heavy load management systems. In this paper, three architectures are proposed which are designed to work with all existing OpenFlow, OpenStack and OpenDaylight platforms. These architectures improve the controller framework without any interruption to network operation. At the same time, some of the key issues related to load balancing and security in a nSDN framework will be addressed. This work will support the IT community not only by reducing the cost of SDN network architecture but also by reducing the cost of load balancing and security that are very important in the networking world.","","","10.1109/IHTC.2015.7238045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238045","Software-Defined Networks;controller;load balancing;security","Computer architecture;Conferences;Control systems;Load management;Monitoring;Security;Software","computer network security;protocols;resource allocation;software defined networking","OpenDaylight;OpenFlow;OpenStack;SDN network architecture;load balancing;role-based multiple controller;software defined network;system security","","0","","15","","","May 31 2015-June 4 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, we analyze and compare different detection algorithms with reference to the worm characteristics by identifying the type of worms that can and cannot be detected by these schemes. After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms.

A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers. We define this mapping for a) various types of tree structures that have been proposed previously for dynamic wireless systems and b) a hypercube structure that presents promising resiliency characteristics.

Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules.

Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture.

In the literature, watchdog model was proposed to detect network related attacks. However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.","2376-6492;23766492","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469","Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward","Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection","","0","","19","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we proposed malicious node detection protocol using authentication technique for ad hoc as well as internet networks. As the protocol depends on one-way hash operation and does not consider any high computation such as exponentiation or pairing computation, so it achieves high performance. Besides, the number of message passes is also reduced to authenticate a node within the network. The proposed protocol is simulated using AVISPA software, and the simulation results make certain that the protocol is SAFE under OFMC and CL-AtSe models.

A perfect compensation of the drift caused by the fault on the objective function is shown to be achievable using time varying gains; the set of such time-varying gains is computed and it is shown that it satisfies a suitable autoregressive equation. Further, we estimate the convergence region of the state vector when the proposed compensation technique is used in the presence of persistent unknown but bounded disturbances.

This attacker-driven anti-malware testing is something defenders would ideally want to limit. Given that anti-malware products must be widely distributed to be commercially viable, it is not feasible to prevent attackers from running them. Here we examine whether it may be possible to instead limit the effectiveness of attacker tests. Specifically, we present a game-theoretic model of anti-malware testing where detection timeliness and coverage are parameters that can be adjusted by anti-malware providers. The less coverage and the slower the response, the harder it is for attackers to determine whether their malware will be detected-and the less protection the software provides to hosts running the anti-malware software. While our results are preliminary, they suggest that it is clearly non-optimal for anti-malware vendors to simply maximize coverage and detection time. As we explain, this result has significant implications for product design and (non-malicious) anti-malware testing methodologies.","","","10.1109/WATeR.2014.7015755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015755","","Computers;Game theory;Games;Malware;Software;Testing","invasive software;product design","antimalware products;antimalware software;attacker-driven antimalware testing;detection coverage;detection timeliness;game-theoretic model;malware author testing challenge;product design","","0","","16","","","23-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, regular expressions are used, due to their high expressive power, and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) are adopted to match them. Many works have been proposed to improve DFAs, especially in terms of memory consumption and speed. Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers. The result is that speed scales as the number of processing units.","1930-529X;1930529X","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134010","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Instruction sets;Memory management;Multicore processing;Synchronization","buffer storage;deterministic automata;finite automata;inspection;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;pattern matching;performance evaluation;sampling methods;security of data","DFA parallelization;buffer reordering;buffer requirements;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;multicore systems;packet processing time reduction;parallel systems;regular expression matching performance;sampling technique;text expression","","0","","14","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.","2379-5352;23795352","","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360","SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification","Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory","SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures","NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution","","1","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt different conservative stances toward data uncertainty. It is also shown, by numerical results, that the robust approach in the presence of uncertainty reduces the sensitivity of the solution with respect to data perturbations, and thus improves design stability.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2332816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6842601","NET-ATTP-INT;NET-MONT;SECOTHS","Games;Optimization;Robustness;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks","","","","7","","37","","20140624","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","2154-0217;21540217","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","1","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mitigation process itself is distributed, initiated by the domain of the victim, and involving all domains in the path of an attack (transit domains). We emphasize on filtering malicious flows as close to the attack sources as possible. We propose a modular and scalable approach that leverages on the SDNi (SDN interface) protocol, as the enabler for information exchange between adjacent SDN domains. We extend this protocol by publishing and exchanging pointers to incident reports, formatted according to the IETF IODEF standards and exposed through domain SDN Controllers. Thus, an SDN domain hosting the victim of the attack is able to notify the recipients about the malicious flows that they forward, requesting their filtering until the attack ceases. In order to motivate close cooperation of SDN domains governed by diverse authorities, we implemented and evaluated a reputation mechanism, whereby domains historically assess the behavior of their neighbors, discouraging assistance in case the domain of the victim has a poor cooperation track record.","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502849","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502849","Attack Mitigation;DDoS;OpenFlow;SDN;SDNi","Bandwidth;Collaboration;Computer crime;Filtering;IP networks;Protocols;Publishing","computer network security;protocols;software defined networking","IETF IODEF standards;SDN interface protocol;SDNi protocol;distributed attacks mitigation;distributed denial of service attacks;information exchange;multidomain software defined networks;reputation based collaborative schemes","","","","26","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS): a framework for accurate and efficient IDS","Yu-Sung Wu; B. Foo; Y. Mei; S. Bagchi","Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","11","1","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an alternative, we propose a scalable and efficient zero-configuration enterprise (SEIZE) networking architecture. SEIZE provides plug-and-play capability via globally unique flat addressing, while ensuring scalability and efficiency through shortest-path routing and hash-based location resolution.

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X;0743166X","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of lightweight IDS. The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility. To design the proposed system, several experiments have been conducted, and they indicate that the proposed lightweight IDS can deliver satisfactory system performance.","","","10.1109/CSE.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283334","Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Decision Function;features classification.;features ranking;features selection","Data engineering;Fuzzy sets;IP networks;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Scalability;System performance;System testing;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP/IP network model;application layer IDS;feature selection;fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function algorithm;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS classification scheme;link layer IDS;network layer IDS;network security;transport layer IDS","","3","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From a law enforcement and forensic investigation perspective, cloud computing can be thought of as a double edged sword. While on one hand, the gathering of digital evidence from cloud sources can bring with it complicated technical and cross-jurisdictional legal challenges. On the other, the employment of cloud storage and processing capabilities can expedite the forensics process and focus the investigation onto pertinent data earlier in an investigation.

"OpenSec: Policy-Based Security Using Software-Defined Networking","A. Lara; B. Ramamurthy","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA","IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","","2016","13","1","30","42","As the popularity of software-defined networks (SDN) and OpenFlow increases, policy-driven network management has received more attention. Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc.) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. In this paper, we first provide a more detailed explanation of how OpenSec converts security policies into a series of OpenFlow messages needed to implement such a policy. Second, we describe how the framework automatically reacts to security alerts as specified by the policies. Third, we perform additional experiments on the GENI testbed to evaluate the scalability of the proposed framework using existing datasets of campus networks. Our results show that up to 95% of attacks in an existing data set can be detected and 99% of malicious source nodes can be blocked automatically. Furthermore, we show that our policy specification language is simpler while offering fast translation times compared to existing solutions.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2016.2517407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378982","Network Security;OpenFlow;Software Defined Networking;Software-defined networking;network security;policy specification;policy-based network management","Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Software;Switches","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","GENI testbed;OpenFlow matching fields;OpenFlow messages;OpenFlow-based security framework;OpenSec;SDN;campus networks;human-readable language;intrusion detection;network devices;network security operator;network-aware controller;packet inspection;policy-based security;policy-driven network management;security policies;security services;software-based controller;software-defined networking;source nodes;spam detection","","","","35","","20160112","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator.

The mAIS presented in this paper incorporates feature selection along with a negative selection technique known as the split detector method (SDM). This new mAIS has been compared with a variety of conventional AISs and mAISs using a dataset of information flows captured from malicious and benign Android applications. Our preliminary results show that the newly designed mAIS outperforms the conventional AISs and mAISs in terms of accuracy and false positive rate of malware detection.

The international research shows that network security is on the way to trustworthy network. Apart from current security mechanism, the future trustworthy network adds network behaviour trust and user behaviour trust, so user behaviour prediction is important and significant for realization of the trustworthy network. The paper discusses how to based on past user behaviour to predict future user behaviour, including Bayesian network modeling, prediction grading, computation of prior probabilities of user behaviour, computation of prior probabilities of user behavior attribute and prediction of future user behaviour. In order to meet needs of different prediction of user behaviour for different purpose, we also discuss that how to get and store user's past assorted behaviour statistical data.

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).","","","10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705192","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Cloud computing;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing","AdjointVM approach;capex;capital expenditure;circular chain intrusion detection;cloud computing;confidentiality;data centers;information security;protection architecture defenselessness;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees","","1","","17","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security. However, there is not an effective intrusion detection and self-recovery system to eliminate the harm of DoS attacks. To solve the problem, an agent-based intrusion detection and self-recovery system for WSNs is proposed, which adopts the distributed architecture to monitor intrusion activities and realize abnormal events processing in local nodes.

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members. Using this technique, the overhead on centralized server is reduced. Moreover, the need of each node storing all public keys are diminished thus minimizing the storage overhead on each node.

"The impacts of internal threats towards Routing Protocol for Low power and lossy network performance","A. Le; J. Loo; Y. Luo; A. Lasebae","Sch. of Eng. & Inf. Sci., Middlesex Univ., London, UK","2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","","2013","","","000789","000794","Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy network (RPL) is the underlying routing protocol of 6LoWPAN standard to enable the integration of Wireless Sensor Network on the Internet. Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","1530-1346;15301346","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","1","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","1","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the last few years a number of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed as network security tools. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.","1530-2075;15302075","","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching","","3","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","2166-5710;21665710","","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","4","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These sensors generate large volumes of data which can reveal useful information for enhancing the sustainable development (through improved utilization of resources), as well as the safety and functionality of the system. In this context, a key challenge is to reduce the large data streams into manageable sets of valuable information in a real-time, reliable and cost-affordable fashion. Due to the data volume size and velocity, relying exclusively on traditional data processing systems, such as databases and batch processing, is no longer a suitable option, since it is not feasible to store the data to later process it. Moreover, careful decisions should be made to leverage the existing computing capacity, from embedded devices found in the IVSs to cloud infrastructures. In this paper we study trade-offs of possible options for data-stream processing models and computing infrastructures. Through building an experimental platform that emulates realistic components of a future deployable IVS and validating two different data-stream processing systems with a wellknown benchmark for IVSs, we study options and trade-offs in real-time data stream processing in IVS infrastructures.

We propose an alternative hybrid-NIDS that couples an FPGA with a network adapter to provide hardware support for pattern matching and software support for post processing. The proposed system, SFAOENIDS, offers an extensible open-source NIDS for Solarflare AOE devices. The pattern matching engine-the primary component of the hardware architecture was designed based on the requirements of typical NIDS implementations.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","3","","40","","20120529","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","1573-0077;15730077","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class.

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net. WSNs are particularly vulnerable to failure under such attacks because of their limited energy, processing capacity, and storage. An effective DoS attack merely has to deplete the resources of the nodes to render them unavailable.

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","2325-1271;23251271","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","21","2","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations. Evaluation results show that the anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector is effective in detecting network faults in IP networks, but it has two problems.

IEEE","","2009","","","1","6","Local monitoring has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for mitigating security attacks in multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node.

We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality.

The BIND9 DNS server and its DNS update utilities are enhanced to support new DNS entries with indirect routing information. Protocol software for supporting the establishment of indirect routes based on the new DNS entries is developed for Linux systems.

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks.

To address this issue, we present the design, analysis, and evaluation of opportunistic piggyback marking (OPM) for IP traceback in this paper. The OPM distinguishes itself from the existing works by decoupling the traceback message content encoding and delivery functions in MBT, and efficiently achieves expedited and robust traceback message delivery by exploiting piggyback marking opportunities. Based on the proposed OPM scheme, we then present the flexible marking-based traceback framework, which is a novel design paradigm for IP traceback and has several favorable features for practical deployment of IP traceback.

Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”","1089-7089;10897089","","10.1002/bltj.20371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781206","","","","","","2","5","","","","Summer 2009","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

In the proposed algorithm, the mobility pattern of a specific node is characterized by a multi-leaf tree structure, second-level nodes stands for the possible starting points and leaf nodes stand for the destination node of each possible path. Since our algorithm is using statistical method, a normal profile for each node is generated through extensive experiments, where the specific tree generated may have several starting points and ending with several destination points. For each path between any two nodes (parent and children), we can get the distribution of every different mobility pattern. By comparing the mobility patterns with the training data, we can distinguish abnormal nodes from normal behavior nodes in mobile Ad Hoc networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed detection algorithm can achieve good performance in terms of false alarm rate and detection rate for nodes with regular mobility patterns.","1930-529X;1930529X","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150901","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Scalability;Security;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;pattern recognition;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics)","MANET;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility patterns;mobility profile;multi-leaf tree structure;pattern recognition","","3","","13","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, most intrusion analysts often find it difficult to establish hidden correlations between these two categories of probes and their associated objectives. This paper uses time series analysis to reconstruct workloads using baselines in the range of t<sub>1</sub> = 1s to t<sub>60</sub> = 60s for each intrusion log. Comparisons of the results obtained across different range of datasets demonstrate that alerts triggered by Snort can be used to reconstruct admissible evidence for litigation purposes.

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected. To maintain data integrity and for prevention of black / gray hole attack hash function is used.","","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014732","AODV;Black hole;Cooperative Black hole;MANET;gray hole","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;AODV protocol;MANET;ad hoc on demand distance vector;black hole attack prevention;black-gray hole attack hash function;dynamic topology;geographical position;hash function;malevolent node;mobile ad hoc networks;physical security;wireless connectivity;wireless network","","1","","13","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe the design and an evaluation of Stellar and its Security Assessment Declarative Language (SADL), a fast, stateful, simple-to-use language for assessing the priority of scenarios, on a high traffic network under constant attack. The evaluation of the Stellar system deployed on a large, operational enterprise network demonstrated its ability to scale to high alert volumes while accurately forming and prioritizing scenarios. Stellar not only produced high priority scenarios matching all incidents reported by human analysts, but also discovered additional scenarios of concern that had initially gone unnoticed. Furthermore, by following the simple formalism embedded in example SADL rules, system administrators quickly develop a correct understanding of the network they are protecting.","","","10.1109/IWIA.2005.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410706","","Aggregates;Buildings;Data security;Engines;Information security;Information systems;Laboratories;Protection;Risk management;Space technology","computer networks;real-time systems;risk management;security of data;sensor fusion;specification languages;system monitoring","Stellar;alert aggregation;alert correlation;fusion system;heterogeneous network defense systems;high traffic network;network protection;network risk assessment;operational enterprise network;real-time system;scenario building;scenario construction;security assessment declarative language;security risk assessment;security risk estimation;system administration","","4","1","23","","","23-24 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service.

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole.

Meanwhile, due to the unstable wireless channel in WSNs, the packet loss rate during the communication of sensor nodes may be high and vary from time to time. It poses a great challenge to distinguish the malicious drop and normal packet loss. In this paper, we propose a channel-aware reputation system with adaptive detection threshold (CRS-A) to detect selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. The CRS-A evaluates the data forwarding behaviors of sensor nodes, according to the deviation of the monitored packet loss and the estimated normal loss. To optimize the detection accuracy of CRS-A, we theoretically derive the optimal threshold for forwarding evaluation, which is adaptive to the time-varied channel condition and the estimated attack probabilities of compromised nodes. Furthermore, an attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme is developed to collaborate with CRS-A for stimulating the forwarding cooperation of compromised nodes and improving the data delivery ratio of the network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CRS-A can accurately detect selective forwarding attacks and identify the compromised sensor nodes, while the attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme can significantly improve the data delivery ratio of the network.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2526601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7401098","Wireless sensor network;channel-aware;packet dropping;reputation system;routing;selective forwarding attack;wireless sensor network","Adaptive systems;Monitoring;Packet loss;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","CRS-A;WSN;adaptive aware detection;adaptive detection threshold;attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme;channel aware detection;forwarding packets;information integrity;monitored packet loss;selective forwarding attacks;sensor nodes;time-varied channel condition;wireless channel;wireless sensor networks","","2","","35","","20160208","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

Its major challenge comes from malicious attacks, which cannot be handled by traditional security mechanisms, such as authorization, access control, encryption, etc. Although there existed some intrusion detection systems, current researches on intrusion detection are still insufficient in accuracy and efficiency for two reasons: firstly, most of them implement malicious transaction detection only by matching samples with predefined patterns; secondly, most current researches mainly resort to semantic analyzing or even only manual interventions to judge the malicious attacks. Inspired by the replication technique, we propose and implement a novel logical replication-based intrusion detection solution for CSCW system in this paper. It provides an additional layer of defense against application attacks, especially program attacks.

It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study.

Open Flow, a SDN standard, is currently the only standard that explicitly focuses on multi-vendor openness. Unfortunately, it only provides for traffic engineering on an integrated basis for L2-L4. The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice. Retention of multi-vendor openness for such an approach has not been previously reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.

Different solutions have been proposed to optimize Live video streaming (e.g., Multicast) and to optimize VOD streaming (e.g., Cache). Implementation of these solutions at an Internet service provider (ISP) network or at Content Data Network (CDN) can use on-line classification capability of video streaming flows (or sources) into Live streaming type and VOD streaming type to allow proper optimization. Since all streaming applications use the same streaming protocols, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technologies are practically useless in classifying such applications. In this paper we formulate the problem of on-line video-streaming flow classification. Then, we propose and evaluate two statistical on-line streaming flow classifiers. These classifiers are based on the statistical characterization of the flow packets length. Afterward, we study a slightly different video streaming classification problem, in which we can assume that there are at least X concurrent flows from the same video source, X>1. We propose and evaluate an on-line classifier that decides whether these X flows are Live or VOD. This classifier is based on a simple observation that live streaming flows from the same source transfer the same information almost at the same time, while VOD flows from the same source have larger information offset. The classifiers performance evaluation is based on real traffic dataset. Our single flow best classifier tags 96% of the streams correctly, while our multi-flow classifier successfully tags 96.53% of streams for X=2. We also demonstrate a more complex multi-streaming comparing function that improves the success rate of our algorithm to 97.53% for X>2, but it clearly decreases the algorithm scalability. Finally, additional contribution of this paper includes statistical cha- acterization of live video streaming traffic vs. VOD streaming traffic.","","","10.1109/NCA.2015.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371733","On-line application classification;Statistic application classification;Streaming applications","Classification algorithms;Downlink;IP networks;Internet;Performance evaluation;Streaming media;Uplink","Internet;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication traffic;video on demand;video streaming","CDN;DPI technologies;ISP network;Internet service provider network;VOD streaming;content data network;deep packet inspection technologies;live streaming;on-line flow classification;streaming protocols;time-varying bandwidth;video streaming","","","","11","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","2164-7054;21647054","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"MapReduce intrusion detection system based on a particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm","I. Aljarah; S. A. Ludwig","Department of Computer Science, North Dakota State University, Fargo, USA","2013 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","","2013","","","955","962","The increasing volume of data in large networks to be analyzed imposes new challenges to an intrusion detection system. Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence.

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. Our starting point in this paper is an overall strategy for network resilience, which draws on existing or under development mechanisms, that can be used to maintain acceptable levels of operation in the event of challenges. A crucial part of this strategy is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a new approach to challenge identification that goes beyond current techniques for attack, anomaly or fault detection.

However, individual sensor nodes are vulnerable to some types of attacks because they are usually deployed in open and unprotected environments. Once sensor nodes are compromised, malicious nodes can send erroneous data to the base station, and possibly mislead monitoring results and influence the whole networks' effectiveness. We need to find new mechanisms to protect the wireless networks from attacks. In this paper we develop a scheme for malicious node detection based on weighted-trust evaluation. A weight value is assigned to each sensor node initially. It updates every cycle if the node sends different report from the others. A malicious node will be detected when its weight value is lower than a threshold value. The simulation results show that our approach is more effective in detecting malicious nodes with lower misdetection ratio compared with existing schemes.","1976-0035;19760035","","10.1109/ICUT.2010.5677764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677764","","Base stations;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Simulation;Time factors;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","improved intrusion detection;malicious node detection;weighted trust evaluation;wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","","","16-18 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, MANET is venerable to attacks due to its mobile and ad hoc natures. The security issue is becoming a main concern in the applications of MANET. We consider the problem of decreasing the number of false positives generated by cooperative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, lightweight mobile agent as alternative to the client server distribution model and nonoverlapping zone framework. So it can effectively detect complicated attacks. The data collection, data analysis, alert message and alarm message can be achieved by using mobile agents, which may reduce the data transmission to save the bandwidth resource in the MANET. The model can adjust itself dynamically to adapt to the change of the external environmental. Also the model is robust and scalable.","","","10.1109/CANET.2008.4655310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4655310","","Communication system security;Data analysis;Data communication;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Network servers;Packet radio networks;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;security of data","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile agent intrusion detection system;multi-hop packet radio network","","3","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We need to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly.

Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol.

Consequently, based on the filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence of selection constructs dynamically captured at run-time, a selection-early strategy establishes the efficient evaluation sequence adaptively. For this purpose, the overall filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence is periodically monitored and the sequence is rearranged when its filtering capability is varied higher than a specific threshold. Accordingly, this strategy keeps the current evaluation sequence to be as efficient as possible by coping with a dynamic variation of its filtering capability.

Live network traffic is collected that consists of real normal traffic and both real and penetration testing attack data. Attack data is then inspected and labeled by means of manual analysis. While network attacks and anomaly features vary widely, they share some commonalities that are examined here. Among these are: self-similarity convergence, periodicity, and repetition. Further, the knowledge inherent in the definition of network boundaries and advertised services can provide crucial context that allows the network analyst to consider self-aware attributes when examining network traffic sessions. To these ends the Session Aggregation for Network Traffic Analysis (SANTA) dataset is proposed.

In this follow-up article we introduce the communication framework for the microgrid scenario under investigation. In all communication networks, scholastic delays and performance are inherent.

UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems. This paper describes the UnC architecture in detail, including the actions of each different kind of participant. It describes how UnC deals with well-known attack models, which are readily available on the Internet.The major contribution of this work is to open up a new door for the research community to exploit the predominance of good nodes over malicious ones in order to enhance the security of the PKI ecosystem and the Internet.","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750195","Internet architecture;PKI infrastructure;geographic clusters;notary nodes;security;self-certifying addresses","Artificial neural networks;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Public key;Publishing","Internet;public key cryptography","DNSSEC protocols;Internet unite-and-conquer architecture;PKI model;S-BGP protocol;UnC architecture;public key infrastructure ecosystem;secure BGP protocol;secure DNS protocols;self-certifying mechanism","","0","","41","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","93","","33","","20120323","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level.

However, organizations are looking to design usable and optimal security configurations that can harden the network security within enterprise budget constraints. This requires analyzing various alternative security architectures in order to find a security design that satisfies the organizational security requirements as well as the business constraints. In this paper, we present ConfigSynth, an automated framework for synthesizing network security configurations by exploring various security design alternatives to provide an optimal solution. The main design alternatives include different kinds of isolation patterns for traffic flows in different segments of the network. ConfigSynth takes security requirements and business constraints along with the network topology as inputs. Then it synthesizes optimal and cost-effective security configurations satisfying the constraints. ConfigSynth also provides optimal placements of different security devices in the network according to the given network topology.

To meet the computing demands of everyday operations like Nonfunctional requirements, here we have introduced OCSA to achieve that first security, the misuse case and Attack Tree analysis posed threat and Attack Surface of any Cloud, Second scalability to overcome network traffic congestion and Denial of Service (DoS) because of rapid growth of customers and Third, Storage and Service providing consequences arise and mitigated to achieve Mobility and Virtualization.

In many application cases it is sufficient to provide message authentication at the sink. To implement this requirement using symmetric ciphers, keys shared between each sensor node and the sink have to be established and kept fresh during network operation. This paper presents a key distribution scheme based on the well known elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism that allows us to fulfil the previously outlined requirements efficiently. The DHB-KEY scheme requires only the distribution of a single sink-initiated broadcast message to set individual keys on all sensor nodes. Thus, DHB-KEY has a low complexity and preserves scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy. In the paper we present a protocol specification based on the DHB-KEY scheme and its implementation for the well known TinyOS platform. A physical intrusion detection system in an office building is used to evaluate the protocol implementation.

Intruders can misuse the cloud resources to achieve their malicious goals.

We have used mobile agents to carry intrusion alerts from consumer virtual machines to the management server where correlation takes place. Our system can detect the intrusions on virtual machines, identify the vulnerable ports, and can correlate malicious events to detect distributed intrusions in a cloud based network. Mobile agents are also used to update the signature database at virtual machines being monitored. Mobile agents, being lightweight and flexible software programs, reduce the network load by carrying intrusion-related data and code. DIDMACC provides a scalable and robust intrusion detection system which is a key requirement for cloud networks. We have validated the security of our system using Ptybull 2.0. The results show that use of mobile agents and correlation has improved the detection of DoS attacks.

The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability. In this article we present a classification of key management schemes in sensor networks delineating their similarities and differences. We also describe a novel dynamic key management scheme, localized combinatorial keying (LOCK), and compare its security and performance with a representative static key management scheme.

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET.

Proceedings","","2002","1","","395","399 vol.1","High-speed, switched networks present scalability challenges to a network intrusion detection system, both in terms of the volume of data that must be analyzed, and the extent to which sensors must be inserted into the switched network to achieve comprehensive visibility. An architecture that uses a single point for intrusion assessment would quickly become overwhelmed with incoming event data from intrusion sensors that are deployed on even a moderate number of high-speed links. This is particularly true if an earnest attack (generating many events in a short period of time) is underway. The authors propose a novel architecture that hierarchically distributes the assessment function into two assessment categories - tactical assessment, and strategic assessment. The tactical assessment function provides low-level event correlation and decision making for a small sub-network (e.g., a department LAN, an ATM switch peer group, etc.), and is capable of providing fast, real-time response when millisecond response times are required due to network attacks. The strategic assessment function, on the other hand, implements high-level event correlation, which is useful when a larger view of the network is required (e.g., for low intensity or distributed attacks). The tactical assessment engines interface to the strategic assessment engine by, filtering and summarizing low-level events, ensuring that the strategic assessment engine's workload remains manageable. This paper describes the distributed intrusion assessment architecture in more detail, presents a few application scenarios that benefit from hierarchical attack assessment, and summarizes ongoing work in developing prototype components for this architecture.","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1180474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180474","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Decision making;Delay;Engines;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Scalability;Sensor systems;Switches","asynchronous transfer mode;correlation methods;local area networks;packet switching;security of data;telecommunication security","ATM networks;ATM switch peer group;decision making;department LAN;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion assessment architecture;event data;filtering;high-level event correlation;high-speed links;high-speed switched networks;intrusion mitigation;intrusion sensors;low intensity attacks;low-level event correlation;network architecture;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;real-time response;scaleable architecture;strategic assessment engine;sub-network;tactical assessment engines","","3","","6","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel approach has been proposed, where the communication in a network works on set of random keys called KEY<sub>1</sub>=X+KEY<sub>0</sub>, KEY<sub>2</sub>=X+KEY<sub>1</sub>, KEY<sub>3</sub>=X+KEY<sub>2</sub>...KEY<sub>N</sub>=X+KEY<sub>N-1</sub> to establish the connection between devices and to validate the packets. Since the validation is based on the keys i.e, KEY<sub>1</sub>=X+KEY<sub>0</sub>, KEY<sub>2</sub>=X+KEY<sub>1</sub>, KEY<sub>3</sub>=X+KEY<sub>2</sub>...KEY<sub>N</sub>=X+KEY<sub>N-1</sub> which is delivered by the previous threshold/source node via an alternative path. This ensures that, there is a packet integrity. This technique can trigger a issue of keys length, therefore we can enforce the number of hops to be added for the key generation, after reaching a threshold limit, then keys generation starts from the beginning. Here all nodes in the network would generate a X-key and appends to the flowing/ongoing key. When a source node initiates communication towards a target node, the source node will send a packet to a target via a recognised path. The destination node and threshold node would be holding a expected key which is delivered from the alternative path, when a packet reaches to a destination/threshold node, the packet's key and key of target/threshold node is compared, if both keys are matched then accept the packet as genuine one else discard it or deny the communication. This MANET enforces two level of security validation, first one is, key checking at each threshold node, another is, ensuring key integrity via true node's path to validate the packet.","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324085","AODV;Alternative path;DSR;Flowing-key;MANET;Random-Key;Threshold;X-Key","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Mobile computing;Routing;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;X-key;destination node;flowing-ongoing key;mobile ad hoc network;mobile devices;packet integrity;random keys;robust security;source node;target node;threshold based path oriented network;threshold node","","","","12","","","5-7 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These Networks are used in many applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information therefore security is important in WSNs. Routing attacks can have devastating effect on wireless Sensor Network and present a major challenge when designing security mechanisms. Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack.

Trend detection is the task of finding some unexpected change in some quantity, such as the occurrence of certain topics in a textual data stream. Many established outlier detection methods are designed to search for low-density objects in a static data set of vectors in Euclidean space. For trend detection, high volume events are of interest and the data set is constantly changing. These two problems appear to be very different at first. However, they also have obvious similarities. For example, trends and outliers likewise are supposed to be rare occurrences. In this paper, we discuss the close relationship of these tasks.

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478","Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation","Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations","distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations","DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation","","2","","43","","20141110","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing host based intrusion detection systems detects the intrusion using complete feature set and it is not fast enough to detect the attacks. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient HIDS - Correlation based Partial Decision Tree Algorithm (CPDT).

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented. NS-3 simulation platform has been used to carry out performance analysis of these hierarchical routing protocols. The performance analysis shows that the hierarchical routing protocols, TL-LEACH, 3L-LEACH and 4L-LEACH fare better than the LEACH protocol.","","","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779352","LEACH;WSN;energy efficiency;network lifetime","Monitoring;Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","NS-3;WSN;clock speed;computational power;energy efficiency;finite battery energy;load balancing;multilevel LEACH protocol model;network lifetime;routing protocol;sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","6","","17","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inst. of New York Univ., New York, NY, USA","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2014","22","3","982","995","The emergence of new network applications, such as the network intrusion detection system and packet-level accounting, requires packet classification to report all matched rules instead of only the best matched rule. Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","1","","37","","20130722","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

Network topology authentication, and hybrid key cryptography are the building blocks for this proposal: the former means that a cryptographic key can be generated if and only if the current network topology is compliant to the ldquoplanned network topologyrdquo, which acts as the authenticated reference; the latter means that the proposed scheme is a combination of features from symmetric (for the ciphering and authentication model) and asymmetric cryptography (for the key generation model).

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set).

However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first.

Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods. The obtained results show that the new AACK scheme outperforms both of the TWOACK and Watchdog methods in terms of network packet delivery ratio and routing overhead.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/AINA.2010.136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474764","AACK;DSR;IDS;MANET;Misbehaving;TWOACK;Watchdog;packet dropping","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Power system protection;Protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing","MANET;adaptive acknowledgment intrusion detection;authentication solutions;encryption;forward packets;mobile ad-hoc network;network packet delivery ratio;node detection enhancement;routing overhead;wireless links","","8","","20","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed.

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","3","","39","","20121130","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We believe SDN provides new research opportunities to security, and it can greatly impact network security research in many different ways. However, till today, SDN has not been well recognized by the security community yet.

In Mobile computing, mobility and scalability should be possible in many applications. Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. In MANET infrastructure does not need a fixed network. Every node act as a transmitter and receiver. Communication occurs within their same communication range only, and communicate directly each other. Otherwise, they should relay on their neighbors to send relay messages. In open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. A new instruction-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. In existing system RSA and Digital Signature are used. In this paper to reduce the network overhead caused by digital signature by using AES public key cryptography system and AODV routing protocol. To develop efficient instruction-detection mechanisms, protect MANET from attacks. It detects malicious misbehavior nodes more efficiently.","","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033917","Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV);Advanced Encryption Standard (AES);Digital Signature;Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA);Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);Routing Overhead (RO)","Digital signatures;Encryption;Mobile ad hoc networks;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","digital signatures;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;public key cryptography;routing protocols","AES public key cryptography system;AODV routing protocol;EAACK;MANET;RSA;digital signature;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attackers;malicious misbehaviour nodes;mobile ad hoc network;mobile computing;network overhead","","0","","24","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recognizing that the smart objects in IoT are most likely human-carried or human-operated devices, we propose a scalable trust management protocol for IoT, with the emphasis on social relationships. We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application. Our results indicate that trust-based service composition significantly outperforms non-trust-based (random) service composition and its performance approaches the maximum achievable performance with global knowledge.","","","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263792","Internet of things;Trust management;performance analysis;social networks","Accuracy;Communities;Convergence;Internet;Protocols;Quality of service;Security","Internet;computer network reliability;computer network security;protocols;trusted computing","Internet of Things;IoT;community-interest;cooperativeness;direct observations;false recommendation attacks;global knowledge;heterogeneous network environments;honesty;human-carried devices;human-operated devices;indirect recommendations;malicious nodes;maximum achievable performance;reliability management;scalable trust management protocol;smart objects;social encounter event;social interaction event;social relationships;trust aggregation;trust assessment accuracy;trust convergence time;trust evaluation;trust parameters;trust properties;trust-based service composition application","","1","","20","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For applications using resource-restricted RFID tags and mobile hand-held readers, however, various risks could threaten their abilities to provide essential services to users. High mobility of the RFID system components and the open nature make an RFID system vulnerable to various attacks. Currently, although some techniques exist that might help improve survivability; there is still no complete proposal on survivability of an RFID system despite its growing popularity and importance in many applications. In this paper, we study survivability issues related to RFID systems and survey existing techniques whose usability and adaptability toward survivability would be beneficial.

VisFlowConnect-IP allows an operator to visually assess the connectivity of large and complex networks on a single screen. It provides an overall view of the entire network and filter/drill-down features that allow operators to request more detailed information. Preliminary reports from several organizations using this tool report increased responsiveness to security events as well as new insights into understanding the security dynamics of their networks. In this paper we focus specifically on the design decisions made during the VisFlowConnect development process so that others may learn from our experience. The current VisFlowConnect architecture - the result of these design decisions - is extensible to processing other high-volume multi-dimensional data streams where link connectivity/activity is a focus of study.

Since each device in the network has measurement and estimation limitations, more than one device needs to be chosen, and observations can be fused to increase observation accuracy using Dempster-Shafer theory for data fusion. The system decides whether user authentication (or IDS input) is required and which biosensors (or IDSs) should be chosen, depending on the security posture.

MYSEA seeks to meet two compelling requirements, often assumed to be at odds: enforcing critical, mandatory security policies, and allowing access and collaboration in a familiar work environment. Recent additions to the MYSEA design expand the architecture to support a cloud of cross-domain services, hosted within a federation of multilevel secure (MLS) MYSEA servers. The MYSEA cloud supports single-sign on, service replication, and network-layer quality of security service. This new cross-domain, distributed architecture follows the consumption and delivery model for cloud services, while maintaining the federated control model necessary to support and protect cross-domain collaboration within the enterprise. The resulting architecture shows the feasibility of high-assurance, cross-domain services hosted within a community cloud suitable for inter-agency, or joint, collaboration.

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the soft decision based on the neural network, the robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved.

MANET nodes operate in a decentralized ""trust no peer"" mode that complicates and inhibits security services, thus creating a formidable security challenge. Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a ""neighborhood watch"" concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X;1062922X","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","6","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

The ACMS algorithm also provides high flexibility that it can be tuned to fit specific performance requirement and resource constraints.

Therefore, the introduction of mobile agents to provide computational security by constantly moving around within the internal infoways of an organization is presented as a natural solution to prevent both external and internal sources of intrusion. This work presents an evaluation of the use of mobile agent mechanisms to add mobility features to the process of monitoring intrusion in computational systems.

It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","2376-6492;23766492","","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004","","Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy","","1","","18","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.

Many clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, most of them implicitly assume that nodes behave honestly in the clustering process. In practice, there might be some malicious nodes trying to manipulate the clustering process to make them serve as clusterheads, which can obtain some special power, e.g., eavesdropping more messages. In this paper we present a secure weighted clustering algorithm (SWCA). SWCA uses the weighted clustering algorithm (WCA) for clustering and TELSA for efficiently authenticating packets. We propose a novel neighbor verification scheme to check whether the values of election-related features (e.g., node degree) are forged by malicious nodes. Also, we theoretically analyze the probability for a malicious node to tamper node degree without being detected and derive a lower bound on the probability. Finally, simulation results show that SWCA is secure but still has comparable performance with WCA. To the best of our knowledge, SWCA is the first algorithm considering the security of 1-hop type clustering (in this type only the clusterhead can communicate with ordinary members directly) in ad hoc networks.","1525-3511;15253511","","10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4917979","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Clustering algorithms;Communications Society;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Security;Software algorithms","ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","QoS;ad hoc networks;broadcasting;malicious node probability;packet authentication;routing;secure weighted clustering algorithm;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","26","","","5-8 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our scheme, each node keeps track of three categories of behavior defined and classified by an external trusted authority, and updates its knowledge about other nodespsila behavior with 3-dimension Dirichlet distribution. Differentiating between suspicious behavior and malicious behavior enables nodes to make multilevel response by either revoking keys of malicious nodes or ceasing the communication with suspicious nodes for some time to gather more information for making further decision.

As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer.

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement with respect to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632412","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","data-dependent decision fusion;feature vector;intrusion detection systems;neural network supervised learner unit;performance enhancement;sensor fusion","","3","","30","","","June 30 2008-July 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most tested and reliable technologies to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks. It is critical to implement network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic and high-speed connectivity. Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped. We suggest a parallel NIDS technology to reduce dropping packets as a solution.","","","10.1109/ICEBE.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686259","IDS;network security;open source","Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DoS/DDoS;HTTP;ICMP;Snort NIDSs;Snort performance analysis;TCP;UDP;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;flood attacks;high-speed traffic;incoming network traffic monitoring;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection systems;outgoing network traffic monitoring;security tools;unauthorized usage identification;wireless systems","","3","","23","","","11-13 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite these benefits, service chaining graphs can be further improved through the use of techniques that have not been satisfactorily explored yet, such as Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM). In PBNM, policies can be written and triggered during runtime, thus supporting the dynamic (re)configuration of service graphs with minimal disruption. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically design NFV service chaining graphs based on policies. These policies rule the forwarding of traffic and the construction of service chaining graphs. In our approach, service chaining graphs are enforced dynamically in the network during runtime.

In this paper, we present efficient schemes for analyzing and optimizing the time duration for which the intrusion detection systems need to remain active in a mobile ad hoc network. A probabilistic model is proposed that makes use of cooperation between IDSs among neighborhood nodes to reduce their individual active time. Usually, an IDS has to run all the time on every node to oversee the network behavior. This can turn out to be a costly overhead for a battery-powered mobile device in terms of power and computational resources. Hence, in this work our aim is to reduce the duration of active time of the IDSs without compromising on their effectiveness. To validate our proposed approach, we model the interactions between IDSs as a multi-player cooperative game in which the players have partially cooperative and partially conflicting goals. We theoretically analyze this game and support it with simulation results.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2557808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458182","Ad hoc networks;energy efficiency;intrusion detection","Games;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless networks","","","","","","","","20160422","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","J. T. L. Ho; G. G. F. Lemieux","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on","","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.","","","10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368","","Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic","computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases","Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler","","7","","22","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This creates challenges regarding traffic management and requires traffic-aware intelligent network management to deliver sustained quality of experience (QoE) for subscribers. Deep Packet Inspection and Analysis (DPIA) provides base platform for development of traffic-aware intelligent network management and security systems. However, computationally complex DPIA related packet processing for high speed data traffic makes these systems expensive. Furthermore, conventionally these traffic-aware network management and security systems are deployed in enterprise networks with independent and dedicated DPIA related processing resources and require multiple copies of passively provisioned high speed data from network, while performing similar DPIA operations over same data again and again. This duplicate deployment of expensive software and hardware resources for DPIA processing eventually results in higher capital expenditures (CAPEX) as well as operational expenditures (OPEX) for network operators. We have proposed a novel Service-Oriented framework for heterogeneous Deep Packet Inspection and Analysis (SoDPI) that simultaneously provides diversified DPIA services to multiple client applications for network management and security operations in high speed networks. Proposed framework provides flexible and comprehensive API based service interface for client applications to register required DPIA services. SoDPI framework implementation is based on commodity hardware and deploys shared set of DPIA related packet processing components, requiring only single copy of passive data provisioned from network. Experimental evaluations show that novel SoDPI framework requires considerably reduced amount of software and hardware resources to f- lfill heterogeneous DPIA packet processing requirements for multiple client applications in comparison to conventional network management and security applications with dedicated DPIA components. This results in lower cost impacts for network operators with more network manageability.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2609398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7567523","Cost effective;Deep Packet Inspection;Network Monitoring;Service Oriented;Traffic-Aware Network Management","Cost benefit analysis;Monitoring;Service-oriented architecture;Telecommunication network management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","","","","","","","","20160914","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To provide this desired service guarantee to high priority flows, we build dynamic network flow model, propose multi-layered network flow-rate constrain algorithms and define a series of malicious-based packet discarding policies.

As an extension of Grid Computing and Distributed Computing, CC aims to provide users with flexible services in a transparent manner. The distributed implementation of CC creates a suitable environment for easy targets, vulnerable and prone to sophisticated attacks. Commonly virtualization is the most utilized technology to implement a Cloud environment with a massive multi-tenancy usage, opening a door to a whole other level of security issues. This creates new targets for intrusion due to the complexity of access and difficulty in monitoring all interconnection points between systems, applications, and data sets. This raises many questions about the appropriate infrastructure, processes, and strategy for enacting detection and response to intrusion in a Cloud environment. This article discusses the security and the visibility issues of an inter-VM traffic and solutions for it within a Cloud environment context, by proposing an approach relying on distributed intrusion detection technique and packet inspection.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516788","","","cloud computing;grid computing;security of data;virtual machines","CC;cloud computing;cloud environment;distributed computing;distributed intrusion detection technique;grid computing;inter-VM packet inspection;inter-VM traffic;interconnection points;virtual machines","","1","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Detecting Malicious Javascript in PDF through Document Instrumentation","D. Liu; H. Wang; A. Stavrou","","2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","","2014","","","100","111","An emerging threat vector, embedded malware inside popular document formats, has become rampant since 2008. Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect and confine malicious Javascript in PDF with minor performance overhead.","1530-0889;15300889","","10.1109/DSN.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903571","Malcode bearing PDF;document instrumentation;malicious Javascript;malware detection and confinement","Context;Feature extraction;Instruments;Malware;Monitoring;Portable document format;Runtime","Java;document handling;feature extraction;invasive software;ubiquitous computing","Javascript execution;Javascript support;PDF;context monitoring code;context-aware approach;document format;document instrumentation;embedded malware;emerging threat vector;evasion attempt;malicious Javascript confinement;malicious Javascript detection;malicious document identification;online protection system;potential infection attempt detection;runtime feature;runtime monitoring;security analysis;sophisticated adversaries;static feature extraction","","2","","47","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think","R. D. Graham; P. C. Johnson","","Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE","","2014","","","185","190","A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed procedure a 2D mesh topology is selected first while PCA algorithm is represented in form of a task graph, which can be divided into 2 levels. In the higher level, tasks are matrix-based algorithms, such as mean computation, which in turn will be mapped onto the NoC topology. Since the NoC is scalable, an appropriate size of 2D mesh will be selected so that the timing of each task in the task chain is matched resulting in an effective pipeline in the higher level. The simulation using SystemC with NoC modeled as Cycle-Accurate showed that an average throughput of 2.20 Gbps and latency of 0.025 cycle/flit were achieved while computing the matrix multiplication of size 112×92 with 81 Processing Element (PE) organize as 9×9 while running with clock speed of 100 MHz.","","","10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6381018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381018","2D Principal Component Analysis (2D-PCA);Homogeneous Processor;Networks-on-Chip (NoC);Parallel Matrix Multiplication;System-on-Chip (SoC);SystemC","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms","matrix multiplication;network-on-chip;principal component analysis;topology","2D mesh topology;NoC topology;PCA algorithm;SystemC;hardware implementation;matrix based algorithm;matrix manipulation;matrix multiplication;mean computation;networks on chip paradigm;principal component analysis;processing element;task chain;task graph","","0","","9","","","2-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT.

Renault","Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs., Nozay, France","IFIP Networking Conference, 2013","","2013","","","1","9","Guaranteeing a high availability of communication services to customers is a day-to-day challenge for Carrier networks. In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We demonstrate that an active-probing-based network intrusion detection system (AP-NIDS) is practical for WMNs. The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS. We validate our model by means of testbed experimentation. We integrate it to our open source AP-NIDS DogoIDS and run it in an indoor wireless mesh testbed utilizing the IEEE 802.11s protocol. For the example of a selective packet dropping attack, we develop the detection states for our Bayes model, and show its feasibility.

In this paper, we study pipeline sharing, such that a single pipeline can be used to serve several packet types. Pipeline sharing decreases the needed total number of cores, but typically increases pipeline lengths and therefore packet delays. We consider two novel optimization problems of allocating cores between different packet types such that the average or the worst-case delay is minimized. We study the two problems and suggest optimal algorithms that apply under different assumptions on the input. We also present greedy algorithms for the general case.

Sci., Tohoku Univ., Sendai","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","","2009","58","5","2471","2481","Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are usually formed without any major infrastructure. As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","37","","45","","20081125","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence there is an utmost necessity of a mechanism to identify the attack and protect the system from the attackers. In this paper we present a method on providing security in MANET during route maintenance phase using Attacker Detection System (ADS) with the help of Honeypot (HP) and Attack History Database (AHD). The HP interacts with the attackers in order to know their motives and respond accordingly. The use of AHD helps HP in quick attack/attacker identification and crafting replies to attacker. We have simulated MANET with ADS and implemented it in sizes varying from 20 to 200 nodes in NS2. The results presented in paper conform to our claim on the efficiency of ADS in protecting MANET.

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load ""hot-spot"", which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), a crucial component of the Smart Grid is increasingly vulnerable compared to traditional mechanical meters. In this paper, by adopting data fusion, an AMI intrusion Detection System (AMIDS) algorithm is carried out that merges the sensors and data from a smart meter to disclose any attack or energy theft precisely. To have information and system control from Smart Grid, smart meters are deployed at user's premises. When the attacker tries to steal energy from the grid, AMI (smart meter) detects the energy (packet) drop and thus we also implemented the cryptographic algorithm called Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), to secure our system. Our experimental results show improvement in throughput, having low latency, less energy consumption and higher efficiency of the systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0044-9; POD:978-1-5090-0045-6","10.1109/IOTA.2016.7562709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562709","AMIDS;ECDSA;Smart Meters;Smart Microgrid","Cryptography;Electronic mail;Home appliances;Microgrids;Smart grids;Smart meters;Standards","","","","","","","","","22-24 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, the IDSs can perform other functions like intrusion prevention (IPS), including proactive functions. A recurrent problem in intrusion detection systems is the difficulty to distinguish legitimate access from attacks. A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time. The paper also makes an analysis of the features used to classify data in order to define which of them are really relevant for each class of attack defined in our experiments.","1530-1346;15301346","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546735","Artifitial Neural Network;Internet Security;Intrusion Detection System;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probes;Support vector machines;Training","","","","14","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RADAR is designed to detect and divert suspicious/malicious traffic (within an enterprise network) to safe locations for further analysis. Current practice requires the manual redirection of malicious traffic, incurs a significant amount of human effort, and results in major delay in response. The RADAR system includes network monitoring and traffic filtering/diversion with threat detection, ruleset generation, rule dissemination (similar to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Flowspec) and threat analysis capabilities. RADAR decouples Flowspec features from BGP routing and provides the flexibility to use any standard routing protocol such as BGP and OSPF to divert the traffic. BGP is used for the purpose of demonstration. A scalable and hybrid network testbed is developed to emulate an enterprise network, where normal and malicious traffic flows, i.e., denial of service (DoS) attacks, are generated. A NetFlow based network monitoring tool is used to provide near real-time traffic specification feedback and a flow based intrusion detection system is used to detect DoS TCP SYN attacks. Ruleset generation and diversion mechanisms are developed to construct BGP updates for the redirection of malicious flows. The successful diversion of malicious traffic is demonstrated with Cisco and Linux routers for testing different scenarios in the network testbed.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0770-7; POD:978-1-5090-0771-4","10.1109/THS.2016.7568889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568889","attack detection;cyber security;network resilience;network testbed;traffic diversion","","","","","","","","","","10-11 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Twenty-third AnnualJoint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","","2004","4","","2404","2413 vol.4","Security is a critical issue in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security. Finally, we present the simulation results to justify the feasibility and evaluate the effectiveness of SPREAD.","0743-166X;0743166X","","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354662","","Application software;Computer network reliability;Computer security;Cryptography;Data security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;SPREAD scheme;data confidentiality service;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing technique;multiple independent path;path set optimization algorithm;secret message protection;secret sharing scheme;security protocol for reliable data delivery","","60","","26","","","7-11 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge.

In behavior-based approaches to anomaly detection, the model of normal behavior is constructed from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns. Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure. Permutations of the representation can be used to achieve more precise discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Quantitative results are given for the recognition ability of contiguous-bits matching together with permutations.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.817026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262509","","Artificial immune systems;Biological systems;Computer science;Detectors;Distributed processing;Intrusion detection;Iron;Object detection;Pattern matching;Random variables","evolutionary computation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis;string matching","anomalous pattern detection;anomaly detection;partial matching rule;pattern recognition;positive pattern detection;r-chunk rule","","69","1","69","","","Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The fundamental mechanisms employed in this approach includes: (1) The separation of execution and state management, which enables the use of a single process to manage application requests, thereby reducing runtime overhead and enables highly concurrent executions. (2) The append-only logging policy, which protects the state of the system against an intrusion attack and ensures a clean state for the system to fallback on during recovery. (3) The use of acceptance testing as a way of verifying the integrity of the execution of application requests.","","","10.1049/cp.2013.0063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617506","Acceptance Test;Fault and Intrusion Tolerance;Logging and Checkpointing;Replication","","fault tolerance;security of data","acceptance testing;append-only logging policy;building mission-critical systems;intrusion attack;intrusion tolerant systems;state management","","0","","","","","27-29 April 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

This analysis can either be done on real system or by developing analytic models. First approach is less desirable, since such an analysis is typically done in a post-facto manner after any problem has occurred. The modeling approach on the other hand, can be done in an a-prior manner and is also much less costly. In this paper an architecture for internet voting system based on dependable web services is described as our case study. Dependability attributes are applied to this system as one of the most important specifications of critical systems. On the other hand voting requirements is considered in this architecture. After explaining the architecture it is modeled with RBD and Petri nets. Then these models are evaluated and reliability, availability and system failure is calculated quantitatively. By using these quantitative results, we can understand whether the system which is going to be created based on this model, will address our requirements or not.","","","10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6271332","Availability;Dependability;Modeling;Petri net;RBD;Reliability;Web Services","Availability;Fires;Portals;Security;Web services","Internet;Petri nets;Web services;public administration","Petri nets;RBD;availability;computer systems;dependable WebServices;internet voting system;modeling evaluation;post-facto manner;quantitative evaluation;reliability;system failure","","1","","9","","","3-5 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper concerns using Computational intelligence based learning machines for intrusion detection in hierarchical order of attacking scenarios, which is a problem of general interest to transportation infrastructure protection since a necessary task thereof is to protect the computers responsible for the infrastructure's operational control, and an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To squeeze the best out of network capabilities, there is need for algorithms for optimal placement of the security functionality in the cloud infrastructure. However, due to the large number of flows to be considered and complexity of interactions in these networks, the classical placement algorithms are not scalable. To address this issue, we elaborate an optimization framework, namely OCDO, that provides adequate and scalable network security provisioning and deployment in the cloud. Our approach is based on an innovative multistage approach that combines together decomposition and segmentation techniques to the problem of security functions placement while coping with the complexity and the scalability of such an optimization problem.

Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection.

But many attacks can only be recognized if logs and events of different security components are combined and correlated with each other.

Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Thus the nodes find a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network. Since the data packets do not reach the destination node on account of this attack, data loss will occur. Simulated the sinking behaviour and collision behaviour attack in various wireless ad-hoc network scenarios and have tried to find a response system in simulations.

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack. Furthermore, the approach includes reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability.","","","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160207","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Base stations;Computer science;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Watermarking;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SFD;WSN;data transmission;security attacks;selective forwarding detection;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster.

The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility.

In this paper, we propose an autonomous mobile agent based intrusion detection architecture to address security in wireless body area networks.

Traditionally, the approach taken to find attacks is to inspect the contents of every packet. However, packet inspection cannot easily be performed at high-speeds. Therefore, researchers and operators started investigating alternative approaches, such as flow-based intrusion detection. In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed. The concept of flows is explained, and relevant standards are identified. The paper provides a classification of attacks and defense techniques and shows how flow-based techniques can be used to detect scans, worms, Botnets and (DoS) attacks.","1553-877X;1553877X","","10.1109/SURV.2010.032210.00054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5455789","Botnets;DoS;Network flows;attacks;intrusion detection;scan;worms","","IP networks;computer network security;data flow analysis;invasive software","Botnets;DoS attacks;IP flow based intrusion detection;data flow;packet inspection;worms","","75","","82","","20100426","Third Quarter 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For instance, MANET is riddled by issues like unreliability of wireless media, uncertain connectivity, host mobility and lack of infrastructure. However, perhaps, a most important aspect of such networks is the problem of security. The computational load and complexity involved in this environment are strongly subject to the dynamic nature of network topology, especially the restriction by the node's available resources. Therefore, key management and authentication are a central aspect for security in MANET and thus they should not be weak. For such small-scale networks, we propose here a security architecture utilizing a seniority-based trust model and PGP type certification service by building a specific PKI. Related algorithms are also presented. The performance of this new model is evaluated through simulation. The model should find wide applicability because it is simple, easy to deploy, efficient, and more secure and reliable than other existing solutions in the literature.","","","10.1109/ISBAST.2008.4547670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4547670","MANET;PGP;PKI","Authentication;Buildings;Certification;Communication system security;Computer networks;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Telecommunication computing;Telecommunication network topology","ad hoc networks;computational complexity;cryptography;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET dynamic topology;certification service;computational complexity;computational load;hybrid cryptography model;key authentication;key management;security management;seniority-based trust model;small-scale networks;trust model;uncertain connectivity;wireless media","","1","","12","","","23-24 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method enhances the centralized management mechanism, where a controller reactively installs rules based on receiving the first packet of each flow, to reduce the load in the controller by decreasing the packets transmitted to the controller for packet inspection. The main feature of this method is that the gateway function redirects unknown packets to another gateway function instead of the controller, and the matched rules are installed in every gateway function on the redirection path using reverse-path forwarding. Using a simulation system, we showed that the enhanced method can reduce the number of packets arriving at the controller per unit time by ~ 62% under our use case assumption.","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414122","","Inspection;Logic gates;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Servers;Virtualization","internetworking;mobile radio;network servers;telecommunication network management;virtualisation","gateway function;gateways scalable management;mobile network virtualization;packet inspection;redirection-based rules sharing;reverse-path forwarding;simulation system","","","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attack graph is commonly used for analyzing network security level for its capability in reflecting all network vulnerabilities and their inter relationships. However, attack graph assumes an over pessimistic situation by giving the attacker unlimited power of exploiting each chain of vulnerabilities in the network, leading the complexity of analyzing to grow exponentially with the size of network. Therefore, the weakest paths suggested by such analysis could be inaccurate for adversary with limited computation power. In this paper, we investigate how attackers are planning to exploit vulnerabilities towards their targets and present the idea of a goal-oriented analysis of attack graph to address this problem.

The cognitive nodes in the network can dynamically adapt to changing network environments by adjusting their design parameter settings over time to establish an acceptable trust level with other nodes.

Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","2","1","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The requirement for high throughput and high level of reconfiguration together put Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology into the focus of high performance networking. In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture.

Among them, a threat caused by black hole attack is more prominent. A trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes while a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing to inner attacks. The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks. On the other hand, the proposed method tries to balance the trust values from different neighbour nodes to mitigate the damage by their deceiving. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attack.","1738-9445;17389445","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174693","Black hole attack;Direct trust value;Grey hole attack;Historical evidence;Indirect trust value;MANET;Trust management strategy","Bismuth;Cryptography;Digital TV;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nickel;Relays","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;trusted computing","MANET;cooperative black hole attack;gray hole attack;historical evidence based trust management strategy;indirect trust value;inner attack;neighbour observing model;neighbour recommendation model;watchdog concept","","4","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents.

This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns.

However, with the advent of collaborative computing and data sharing, more and more new modes of interaction have evolved resulting in the need and use of distributed resources. Work within this community has led to the development of Grid technologies, which address precisely these problems. In grid computing, heterogeneous resources distributed geographically are virtualized as a unified whole. Grid computing, as a result, provides enormous opportunities in terms of resource sharing, maximization of resource utilization and virtualization of resources. Because of its immense potential, not only the scientific community, but also the IT enterprise communities are excited about its prospect. A recent survey ranked grid computing as sixth on priority lists for IT spending among industry professionals. With this much interest, security becomes necessary to provide authentication, authorization, resource protection, secure communication, data confidentiality, data integrity, trust policies management, user key and credential management, service protection, and network security. This paper provides an insight classification of the different mechanisms and methods of security in grid computing environment, and also discusses the solutions for each category and its limitation in order to define the real problems in grid computing security.

The scheme is based on Exclusion Basis System (EBS) for scalability and simple symmetric cryptographic primitives with low computational requirements. It provides periodic or on demand key refreshment and node authentication to improve the security of the network. In addition, it is highly efficient in terms of key refreshment and node revocation.

To cope with such interference, the paper introduces throughput connectivity and weighted throughput connectivity. Throughput connectivity reflects the possibility of establishing communication between nodes for given a signal power level, while weighted throughput connectivity associates the throughput as a weight in the associated network graph. Throughput connectivity is less sensitive to network's parameters than the one based on weighted throughput connectivity. It makes maintaining throughput connectivity protocol less resource consuming (say, by sending less frequently channel state information (CSI)). Whereas, weighted throughput protocol is more efficient in power allocation due to employing a continuous scale in Laplacian matrix. To illustrate these notions, two approaches to maximize connectivity were considered: (a) an adaptive transmission protocol that re-allocates transmission power between nodes, and (b) detecting and eliminating a malicious threat to maintain accumulated connectivity over time slots. The first problem was modeled by a maxmin problem, and solved by Semi-Definite Programming.

Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints such as network congestion, limited node energy levels, or non-cooperation of nodes might severely impact the performance and the robustness of existing planar graph routing variants. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We investigate basic schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network, and derive algorithms for routing and forwarding along these curves. We analytically prove that our scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery in arbitrary planar connected graphs. We implement curve-based routing and show its feasibility by means of a simulation study. As a proof-of-concept scenario, we investigate the case of non-cooperating nodes.

First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols.

Keane","School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K.","IEEE Access","","2016","4","","4183","4206","Node compromise attacks pose a serious threat to wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To launch an attack, an adversary physically captures a node and access data or software stored on the node. Even worse, the adversary may redeploy the captured node back into the network and use it to launch further attacks. To reduce the impact of a node compromise attack on network operations, the network should detect a node compromise as early as possible, ideally soon after a node is being captured, and then isolate the node from future network communications. Solutions for early node compromise detection are based on distributed monitoring of neighboring nodes' aliveness. Nodes regularly send notification (Heartbeat) messages to their one-hop neighbors to indicate their aliveness. If no message is received from a node (i.e., if a node is not heard) for a certain period of time, then the unheard node is said to have been compromised. This approach may have a large number of false positive errors when the message loss ratio in the network is high, as missing messages could be caused by message loss during transmission, in addition to node compromises. This paper proposes a novel scheme, called an adaptive early node compromise detection scheme, to facilitate node compromise attack detection in a cluster-based WSN. The scheme is designed to achieve a low false positive ratio in the presence of various levels of message loss ratios. To achieve this feature, two ideas are used in the design. The first is to use cluster-based collective decision making to detect node compromises. The second is to dynamically adjust the rate of notification message transmissions in response to the message loss ratio in the sender's neighborhood. The performance of the scheme, in terms of false positive ratio, false negative ratio, and transmission overheads, is evaluated using simulation. The results are compared against those from the most relevant scheme in the literature. The comparison results s- ow that our scheme can detect all the node compromises in the network more effectively and efficiently, regardless of the message loss ratio in the underlying environment.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2594478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530851","Node compromise attack;adaptive;detection;wireless sensor networks","Adaptation models;Network security;Propagation losses;Telecommunication network management;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","adaptive early node compromise detection scheme;cluster based collective decision making;distributed monitoring;false negative ratio;false positive ratio;hierarchical WSN;transmission overheads;wireless sensor networks","","","","","","20160803","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall ""network behavior"" of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system. Results shows that the richness of the Network Connectivity Graph provides a much more detailed picture of malicious activities, considerably enhancing our understanding.","1095-2055;10952055","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288435","","IP networks;Itemsets;Malware;Monitoring;Protocols;Servers","Internet;graph theory;invasive software","Internet;Malware;malicious activities;malicious pattern;malicious traffic dissection;network behavior;network connectivity graph;network user privacy;network users security;research community;security practitioners","","","","18","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code.

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","27","5","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","2","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","20150710","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We use the bus nodes as the cluster-heads to gather the routing control messages and data packets transmitted among the vehicles. The bus nodes first transmit the original network behavior information to the access points deployed along the road sides. Then the access points can get a global view of the VANETs, and we can detect anomaly behaviors through analyzing the data. The anomaly detection method is based on the neural network which can build the normal network behavior model through learning process. After the trained neural network is stable, it can monitor the VANETs security by detecting the network control message and data packet in real time and alarm immediately if there is anomaly behavior. The experiments in NS2 show that the detection method can detect anomaly behavior with low false alarm rate.","","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497798","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Neural networks;Routing;Spine;Spread spectrum communication;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;neural nets;packet radio networks;security of data;system buses;telecommunication network routing;vehicles","BUSNet;NS2;VANET;data packet;dynamic topology;intrusion detection system;learning;multihop cooperative routing;neural network;routing control;vehicular ad hoc networks","","1","","25","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated.

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

The wide-open distributed nature of the network environment leaves it susceptible to stealthy and coordinated attacks designed to access sensitive data, disrupt network communication, or consume resources. Intrusion detection algorithms and approaches are well-known. However, it is uncertain if these approaches are effective in a mobile ad-hoc environment where resources such as bandwidth are limited. To address this problem the Tactical Environment Assurance Laboratory (TEALab) was established to provide an environment for characterizing tactical battlefield ad-hoc networks experiencing intrusive behaviors. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of intrusion detection in a tactical ad-hoc environment. The methodology includes generating representative network event data with and without network attacks, running attacks with widely available intrusion detection systems, and evaluating the behavior of the IDS in an ad-hoc environment.","1525-3511;15253511","","10.1109/WCNC.2004.1311618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311618","","Ad hoc networks;Benchmark testing;Collaboration;Data security;Government;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","TEALab;Tactical Environment Assurance Laboratory;intrusion detection;network communication;tactical mobile ad-hoc networks","","2","","13","","","21-25 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of individual rekeying, i.e., performing a rekey right after each join or leave request is received, periodic batch rekeying has been proposed to alleviate rekeying overhead in resource-constrained wireless networks. The issue of how often rekey operations should be performed, however, has not been addressed. In this paper, we develop a stochastic Petri net (SPN) model to identify the optimal batch rekey interval to minimize periodic rekey overhead while satisfying application-specific constraints in rekey delay and secrecy violation. We develop three new threshold-based schemes, demonstrate the optimal rekey intervals for these three schemes, and identify the best scheme that should be adopted for periodic batch rekeying to minimize rekey overhead, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational and environmental conditions.","","","10.1109/WIRLES.2005.1549463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1549463","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Collaborative work;Computer science;Cryptography;Delay;Security;Stochastic processes;Teleconferencing;Wireless networks","Petri nets;optimisation;radio networks;stochastic processes;telecommunication security","application-specific constraints;batch rekey interval;dynamic network;group communications security;group membership;periodic rekey overhead minimization;rekey delay;resource-constrained wireless networks;secrecy violation;stochastic Petri net model","","0","","13","","","13-16 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2005.","","2005","3","","6 pp.","","Fast virus scanning is becoming increasingly important in today's Internet. While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning ""booster"" technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of ""no-match"" cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of ""bad but cheap"" hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for ""on-access"" virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an ""on-access"" version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.","1930-529X;1930529X","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953","","Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical)","Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory","CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception","","14","7","25","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As per proposal of this paper, the communication in a MANET works on set of random keys called KEY<sub>1</sub>=X+KEY<sub>0</sub>, KEY<sub>2</sub>=X+KEY<sub>1</sub>, KEY<sub>3</sub>=X+KEY<sub>2</sub>...KEY<sub>N</sub>=X+KEY<sub>N-1</sub> to establish the connection between nodes and applies to validate the packets. Since there could be a issue of keys length, hence we can enforce the number of hops to be added for key generation after reaching threshold, then generation of keys starts from the beginning. Here all nodes in the network would generate a X-key and appends to the ongoing/flowing key. When a source node initiates communication towards a destination node, the source node will send a packet to a destination via a designated path. The target node and threshold node would be storing a expected key from all its neighbours, when a packet reaches to a target node or threshold node, key of packet and key of target node is compared, if a match is found, then accept the packet as valid one else discard it or deny the communication. This approach would be very helpful to deny the communication of malicious nodes in the MANET.","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324084","AODV;DSR;Flowing-Key;MANET;Random-Key;Threshold Node;X-Key","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET security;X-key generation;expected key;malicious node denial;packet validation;path oriented randomly generated keys;random key generation","","","","12","","","5-7 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions. In a real implementation/evaluation of our cooperative intrusion detection system, we demonstrate that it achieves a higher detection rate (93%) than state of art solutions (60%-73%).","1095-2055;10952055","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006035","","Biological cells;Delay;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optimization;Power demand","cooperative communication;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless sensor networks","cooperative IDS;cooperative intrusion detection functions;optimal monitoring;resource constrained wireless networks","","0","","15","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778","Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management","finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data","Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton","","0","","25","","20140919","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","2","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The judging rules of the aggressive behavior are summarized in this model according to the different offensive features in routing layer. Moreover, the log is established according to IP packets in routing layer, and the fuzzy evaluation to the data is carried on. On the base of this, a way to enhance the correct rate of the detection by joint detection mechanism of multi-point cooperation has been introduced in this paper. To distribute the network resource dynamically and reasonably, all nodes are treated dynamically with safety classification. Taking AODV routing protocol as an example, the working mechanism of the model is introduced, and the software NS2 is used to put up network simulation platform. The experimental results show that the detection model can guarantee the network security better.","2161-9646;21619646","","10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5301829","","Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Collaboration;Distributed computing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Safety","ad hoc networks;fuzzy set theory;optimisation;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols;vectors","AODV routing protocol;IP packet;ad hoc network;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;aggressive behavior judging rule;communication network security mechanism;distributed intrusion detection model;dynamic classification;fuzzy evaluation;fuzzy judgment model;multipoint cooperation;network resource distribution;network simulation platform;resource optimization;software NS2","","1","","6","","","24-26 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the objective is to provide evidence of the source of actions, especially to detect insiders and illegal connections, without the necessity of decrypting the network traffic. We propose a novel architecture to identify users of encrypted traffic in a network environment of a company. It is based on statistical evaluation of monitored network packets.

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","59","","35","","20120426","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition to simple matching techniques, sophisticated matching operations required by Snort can be implemented by levering an iterative approach that leverages a post processing action RAM.

By defining an overall security goal and a set of criteria with corresponding alternatives, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to select the most suitable, preferred (and thus, adequate) authentication level, which is demonstrated by a realistic case study.","","","10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1628430","","Authentication;Communications technology;Decision making;Energy consumption;Hardware;Mobile communication;National security;Operating systems;Risk management;Wireless networks","","","","3","","13","","","23-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.","","","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454499","Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network;eHealthcare","Computer crime;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;computer network security;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","DoS attacks;Internet of things;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;data packet delivery ratio;denial of service attacks;wireless mesh network;wireless mesh routing protocol","","","","21","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As underlying devices in SDN, SDN switches must maintain a large number of hardware counters. Implementation of these counters faces serious challenges for SDN switches, i.e., High memory consumption and inflexibility. Thus, we previously proposed Software Defined Hardware Counters (SDHC), which decouples definition and implementation of counters to overcome these challenges. However, like traditional hardware counters, SDHC only supports passive statistical mode (i.e., The values of the counters can be only read passively by the controller). Based on the passive mode, most of applications need to send request messages at some frequency to obtain statistics, which causes some critical problems for SDN: i) low statistical accuracy, ii) high network bandwidth consumption. Hyper Software Defined Hardware Counters (Hyper SDHC) is thus proposed by extending SDHC. Through introducing the timer-triggering and updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms, Hyper SDHC can naturally support active statistical mode, i.e., Counters actively report their values according to triggering condition. It can greatly enhance the statistical accuracy and reduce network bandwidth consumption between controller and switch. The demo of Hyper SDHC is implemented based on Net Magic platform. The demo will exhibit how Hyper SDHC works and how it supports a typical video quality monitor application.","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037744","Software Defined Networking (SDN);active statistical mode;counters","Bandwidth;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Software;Switches","software defined networking;statistical analysis","Net Magic platform;SDHC;SDN switches;hyper software defined hardware counters;low statistical accuracy;network bandwidth consumption;software defined networking;timer-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms;updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms","","0","","8","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial.

In fact, when an intrusion is detected by the IDS, it is already happened on the network and the time required to update security rules is usually short, which provide opportunity to the attacker to inflict damages that may paralyze the network. For this purpose we suggest a new approach of distributed intrusion detection system to wisely anticipate and predict intrusions before their first occurrence in the network to secure. Our approach is based on intelligent agents and using honeypot technology to gather a vast scope of information about attacks. Moreover it combines the two detection strategies “anomaly approach and misuse approach”.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518055","Agent;Anticipation and Prediction Strategy;Distributed Architecture;Intrusion Detection System","Computer architecture;Context;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents","","","","","","","","","20-22 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we ask the following question: How well can we classify malware according to network activity? We monitor the execution of a malware sample in a controlled environment and summarize the obtained high-level network information in a graph. We then analyze graphs similarity to determine whether such high-level behavioral profile is sufficient to provide accurate classification of malware samples.

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV. This mechanism is enhancement of Adaptive Acknowledgement (AACK) and TWO-ACK, here we have tried to show the efficiency increment by decreasing number of messages routed in the network.","","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968417","Ad-hoc network;Black Hole;MANET;Permutation;Security","Bandwidth;Decision support systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV;MANET;TWO-ACK;adaptive acknowledgement;black hole attack detection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc network;permutation based acknowledgement;reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;wireless links","","1","","15","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This security method is called as Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since from last two decades IDS becomes core area of many researchers and many methods are already presented for efficient intrusion detection and classification. Most of methods are out dated as many new attacks generated by hackers. In this project our main aim is to presented scalable and efficient method for intrusion detection and classifications. For intrusion detection, we are not using traditional methods, rather we are focusing on using distributed approach, which not only improves the scalability but also improves efficiency. Proposed method is divided into two parts, detection and classification. Attack graph is constructed followed by preprocessing. Attack graph approach is work on modeling the input flows by extracting their features. We have done classification on online data and found attacks.

Due to the distributed nature of the cloud environment, it has high intrusion prospects and suspect of security infringements because the intruders can exploit the large amount of resources in cloud for their attacks. Furthermore, most of current Intrusion Detection System (IDS) solutions do not offer features for cloud environments. This paper presents a hierarchical, autonomous, and forecasting cloud based IDS (HAF-CIDS) that continuously monitors and analyzes system events and computes the risk level. The proposed system improves the detection accuracy through the integration with a forecasting engine that runs the Holt-Winters (HW) algorithm.

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","15","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Netshuffle: Improving Traffic Trace Anonymization through Graph Distortion","V. C. Valgenti; R. R. Paul; M. S. Kim","Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","","2011","","","1","6","Traffic traces provide valuable data to researchers and organizations alike. However, organizations that provide this information do not wish to expose the internal workings of their networks to potential attack. Traffic trace anonymization attempts to mitigate this concern by hiding sensitive information while preserving most of the empirical value of the trace. Unfortunately, many attacks such as statistical fingerprinting, known-plaintext, and port evaluation can serve to identify communications within a trace which can lead an attacker to the real-world identities of anonymized devices. The inherent graph structure embedded in network traffic stands as a primary lever in achieving such de-anonymization. We propose Netshuffle, a method that distorts the graph structure in the anonymized trace such that an attacker cannot rely on the edges (communications) to identify a particular end-node (device). In essence, we shuffle the edges of the graph like a deck of cards so that even if an attacker can identify an edge, that edge does not necessarily connect to the intended target. Thus, inferences based on features of communications will either lead an attacker astray, or force the attacker to guess as to the identity of the targeted node from several indistinguishable candidates. Netshuffle provides a complimentary vector of protection to current anonymization techniques at limited cost in data utility.","1550-3607;15503607","","10.1109/icc.2011.5962451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962451","","Equations;IEEE Communications Society;IP networks;Image edge detection;Merging;Peer to peer computing;Topology","IP networks;computer network security","Netshuffle;anonymized devices;deanonymization;graph distortion;inherent graph structure;known-plaintext;network traffic;port evaluation;statistical fingerprinting;traffic trace anonymization","","1","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform.

An IDS audits UAVs in a distributed system to determine if the UAVs are functioning normally or are operating under malicious attacks. We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance. By adjusting the detection strength, BRUIDS can effectively trade higher false positives for lower false negatives to cope with more sophisticated random and opportunistic attackers to support ultrasafe and secure UAV applications.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2265083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573382","Intrusion detection;security;unmanned air vehicles (UAVs)","Actuators;Gears;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pricing;Sensors;Weapons","ant colony optimisation;autonomous aerial vehicles;multi-agent systems;security of data","BRUIDS;IDS;UAV;adaptive intrusion detection;airborne system;ant-colony clustering model;behavior rule specifications;distributed system;malicious attacks;malicious unmanned air vehicles;multiagent system;opportunistic attacker behaviors;random attacker behaviors;reckless attacker behaviors","","14","","30","","20130802","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This fundamental premise, which we term w<sup>3</sup>, provides a vehicle for comparing between seemingly disparate events. We propose a concise and scalable representation of these three attributes, that leads to a flexible visualization tool that is also clear and intuitive to use. Within our system, alerts can be grouped and viewed hierarchically with respect to both their type, i.e., the what, and to their where attributes. Further understanding is gained by displaying the temporal distribution of alerts to reveal complex attack trends. Finally, we propose a set of visual metaphor extensions that augment the proposed paradigm and enhance users' situational awareness. These metaphors direct the attention of users to many-to-one correlations within the current display helping them detect abnormal network activity.","","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495939","","Complex networks;Data visualization;Decision making;Displays;Humans;Intrusion detection;Moon;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicles","computer networks;data visualisation;security of data","abnormal network activity detection;alert temporal distribution;attack trend;attribute representation;data visualization;disparate logs;many-to-one correlation;network alert visual correlation;network intrusion detection;user situational awareness;visual metaphor","","14","","19","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We detail its characteristics and study its effects on the successful operation of a sensor network. We present state-of-the-art research for addressing wormhole related problems in wireless sensor networks and discuss the relative strengths and shortcomings of the proposed solutions. To date, most of the proposed defenses focus on preventive mechanisms that can be applied to protect sensor networks from this kind of attacks. However, no work has been published regarding the possibility of using more sophisticated methods, like intrusion detection systems, to achieve a more complete and autonomic defense mechanism against wormhole attackers. We present our work on intrusion detection and introduce a lightweight IDS framework, called LIDeA, designed for wireless sensor networks. LIDeA is based on a distributed architecture, in which nodes overhear their neighboring nodes and collaborate with each other in order to successfully detect an intrusion.

This study employs both support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to investigate the time-varying fraud problem. The performance of ANN is compared with that from SVM.

This means that strong cryptography techniques cannot be used and we need another layer of defence to protect the WSN. This makes intrusion detection systems (IDSs) an essential option in these networks.

Existing security schemes may be effective for certain types of attacks, but they lack a comprehensive mechanism to prevent attacks from different protocol layers. Similar problems exist in other networking protocols. Thus, existing communication protocols, ranging from routing, MAC, and physical layers, need to be revisited and enhanced.

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252;15502252","","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","6","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity. The results are valuable in both cyber and physical domains. From a physical perspective, SOCCA scores power system contingencies based on cyber network configuration, whereas from a cyber perspective, control network vulnerabilities are ranked according to the underlying power system topology.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2280399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687271","Contingency analysis;cyber-physical systems;security;situational awareness;state estimation","Algorithm design and analysis;Indexes;Mathematical model;Network topology;Power grids;Security","power grids;power system planning;power system security","SOCCA;accidental contingency;control network;cyber components;cyber network configuration;cyber perspective;cyber-physical security evaluation;grid operation;malicious compromises;physical components;power infrastructures;power system contingency;power system topology;security-oriented cyber-physical contingency analysis","","11","","44","","20131218","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET. The purpose of this paper is to present an improved version of EAACK called EAACK2 that performs better in the presence of false misbehavior and partial dropping.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/AINA.2011.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763422","DSA;Digital Signature;EAACK;MANET","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Encryption;Mobile computing;Public key;Receivers","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","DSA;EAACK scheme;MANET;digital signature algorithm;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;forged acknowledgement detection;mobile ad hoc network;wireless communication mechanisms","","7","1","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While migrating from conventional data centers to cloud computing paradigm, administrators have to consider costs. Security is one of the biggest problems for all information technologies and also in cloud computing. Some mechanisms are used such as antivirus software, firewall, guard systems or intrusion detection/prevention systems to increase the system security. The main handicap of these mechanisms is extensive usage of hardware, especially CPU and memory. In this paper, we examine the hardware usage of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) with different network architectures. Although the virtualization is preferred by the most of the providers, we chose a virtualized environment as our test bed because of its easier implementation structure from other cloud technologies such as grid and blade architectures.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","1","","28","","20150623","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075;15302075","","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture","","2","","21","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks.

In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678;15450678","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Motivated by the multiple conflicting requirements of data sharing, privacy preserving and knowledge discovery, and privacy preserving data mining has become a research hotspot in data mining and database security fields. Researchers have recently made efforts at hiding sensitive association rules. This paper presents a novel based approach that strategically modifies a few transactions in the database.

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities. Major issues, like insecurities related to Address Resolution Protocol and to self-configurability, are discussed. The solutions fall roughly into three categories: accepting Ethernet's insecurity and circling it with firewalls; creating a logical separation between the switches and end hosts; and centralized cryptography based schemes.

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination).

This paper presents a hierarchical and autonomous cloud based intrusion detection system, HA-CIDS. The framework continuously monitors and analyzes system events and computes the security and risk parameters. An autonomous controller receives security parameters computed by the framework and selects the most appropriate response to protect the cloud against detected attacks, as well as recover any corrupted data or affected services. Beside autonomous response to detected attacks, HA-CIDS has several autonomous capabilities to provide self-resilience and fault tolerance.

The proposed mechanism is based on identifying outlier measurements inside each cell, as well as corroboration among neighboring cells in a hierarchical structure to identify cells with significant number of malicious nodes. We provide a framework for taking into consideration inherent uncertainties, such as loss due to distance and shadowing, to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate classification of legitimate measurements as outliers. We use simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against attackers with varying degrees of sophistication.

In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called ant colony clustering model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution.

FPT 2009. International Conference on","","2009","","","1","10","The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification. The results affirm the FPGA as a natural packet processing technology that can be programmed in a high-level manner appropriate to a packe- t-oriented mindset.","","","10.1109/FPT.2009.5377604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377604","","Best practices;Concurrent computing;Data communication;Digital communication;IP networks;Network-on-a-chip;Programming profession;Scalability;Technological innovation;Testing","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based packet processing components;Internet;data communication;digital revolution;field programmable technology;high-level packet-centric language;high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities;natural packet processing technology;packet-oriented mindset;software engineering","","6","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first role of an agent is to perform the work of a local intrusion detection system (IDS). Periodically, it proceeds to exchange security data within its local neighbouring. The agent neighbouring consists of IDS agents of local neighbour nodes. The goal of such an approach is to consolidate the decision, regarding every suspected security event. Unlike previous works having proposed distributed systems for intrusion detection, our system is not restricted to data sharing. It proceeds in the case of a conflict to a negotiation between neighbouring agents in order to produce a consensual decision. So, the proposed system is fully distributed. It does not require any central or hierarchical control, which compromises its scalability, specially in wide area networks such as Internet. Indeed, in this kind of networks, some attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) require fully distributed defence.

Several solutions were proposed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). The main objective of the current work is first to take advantage of data mining techniques such as normalization, feature selection and eliminating redundancies in order to analyze the huge data like the KDDCUP'99. The second objective is the learning ability of neural networks and the third one is the fuzzy logic reasoning that realizes knowledge wave characters. The proposed model is the Neuro-Fuzzy model precisely the NEFCLASS (Neuro Fuzzy Classification) model of a generic fuzzy perceptron which is in the form of a combination of neuron and fuzzy system networks. This model is characterized by its powerfulness thanks to its large database and rapidity due to its parallel architecture. Moreover, it can be easily updated through the re-learning process following the scalability potential inherited in its architecture. As well as it is distinguished by an intuitive model presented by linguistic rules that are easily understood by the security operator. To test out the adaptability of our approach in detecting unknown attacks we use a test database , namely corrected test that contains new attacks that are not present in the training set and compare the results obtained by the model ANFIS. We prove that our approach based on NEFCLASS model is more powerful in classifying intrusions than the one based on ANFIS model. To highlight the motivation for using the Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier, a comparative study was conducted by using the full 10% KDD among the NEFCLASS model and other supervised classifiers which are ANN and C5.0.","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507112","Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;NEFCLASS;Supervised classifier;Uncertainty","Cognition;Computational modeling;Databases;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","computer network security;data mining;database management systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures;pattern classification;perceptrons;resource allocation","ANFIS;ANN;C5.0;IDS;KDDCUP99;NEFCLASS;computer network scability;computer security;data mining techniques;fuzzy logic reasoning;fuzzy system networks;generic fuzzy perceptron;intrusion detection system;intuitive model;knowledge wave characters;learning ability;linguistic rules;neural network;neuro-fuzzy classification;neuro-fuzzy classifier;parallel architecture;relearning process;resource availability;resource confidentiality;resource integrity;supervised classifiers;test database","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible.

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust.

This paper reviews ISP-level address sharing mechanisms, which allow Internet service providers to connect multiple customers who share a single IPv4 address. Some mechanisms come with severe and unpredicted consequences, and all of them come with tradeoffs. We propose a novel classification, which we apply to existing mechanisms such as NAT444 and DS-Lite and proposals such as 4rd, MAP, etc. Our tradeoff analysis reveals insights into many problems including: abuse attribution, performance degradation, address and port usage efficiency, direct intercustomer communication, and availability.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2256147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504560","Address family translation;IPv4 address sharing;IPv6 transition;address plus port (A+P);carrier grade NAT (CGN);network address translation (NAT)","","IP networks;Internet","DS-Lite;IANA-level IPv4 address exhaustion;IPv4 address sharing mechanism classification;IPv4 reachability;IPv6 deployment;IPv6-only Internet;ISP-level address sharing mechanisms;Internet service providers;NAT444;abuse attribution;address efficiency;direct intercustomer communication;performance degradation;port usage efficiency","","4","","62","","20130417","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However these policies may be not sufficient and effective any more when applied to the wireless local area networks (WLANs). WLANs are different from the traditional wired LANs in terms of their exposure to potential threats, vulnerability and security techniques. Intrusions to WLANs are facts of the everyday life and handling them becomes more and more difficult. Currently there is no standardised reference model which may help to design, compare and evaluate the existing or future intrusion handling systems (IHSs) for WLANs. Analysis of the commercial IHSs shows that they all are built as a proprietary systems which are neither taking into consideration existence of other IHSs nor they are trying to find the ways to establish inter-IHS collaboration which may help to achieve better security for the end- users. Hence this paper starts by an analysis of the features of existing IHSs for WLANs, follows with proposing the new ways to enhance their design, and then is discussing development of such a novel reference model for a scalable distributed IHS architecture.","","","10.1109/CANET.2006.279278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4055210","","Communication system security;Communications technology;Computer networks;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Terminology;Wireless LAN","telecommunication security;wireless LAN","intrusion handling systems;scalable distributed IHS architecture;standardised reference model;wired computer network security;wireless LAN;wireless local area networks","","1","","24","","","19-21 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The outside attackers can be prevented with the help of an efficient key management protocol and cryptography. However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism. The protocol is storage scalable and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/AINA.2014.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838720","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Key Management;Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET);Secure Routing","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Mobile computing;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","MANET;broadcast key distribution mechanism;integrated localized key management protocol;intrusion detection system;key management protocol;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor based handshaking and least common multiple;public key cryptography;routing protocol;routing security","","1","","18","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","11","","34","","20120118","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed. Finally, we implement this model on Linux Cent OS 6.3 and evaluate its speed.

However, the inherent nature of PCM technology does not align perfectly with either applications in terms of cost-per-bit, performance, power, endurance or retention. The missing killer applications for PCM have slowed down the technology development from becoming mainstream. From the systems perspective, the ever-growing big data problems call for a paradigm shift from traditional compute-centric system to data-centric system for better performance, efficiency and productivity. A data-centric system will demand new hardware features to support the efficient storage and manipulation of data in a wide range of data-intensive applications. Considering these factors, this paper will give an overview of recent research efforts to enable PCM for building a reliable and efficient ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). By leveraging multiple levels of computing stack - technology, circuit and architecture, we will show a holistic approach of tailoring PCM to meeting the new system requirements.

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection","","1","","28","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose a novel distributed node self-monitoring mechanism for wireless sensor networks. Assuming a sensor node can detect the communications (sending message) of its neighboring nodes, we design a one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, in which the selected nodes, named Monitor Nodes (MNs), can monitor their neighboring nodes. A distributed dominating set approximation algorithm is design to obtain the MN set. The cooperation among MNs guarantees all regular nodes (RNs) are monitored. However, the MNs may be compromised by external attackers and produces false alarms. To improve the one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, we design a many-to-one dynamical monitoring approach to take the MNs under surveillance. The neighboring nodes of a MN are dynamically selected to monitor their MN. In the proposed mechanism, a node produces an alert when it detects abnormal behaviors of the node under surveillance. The sink node collects the alert messages to make judgment to the potential abnormal nodes. The proposed self-monitoring mechanism can be used to detect and position multiple inter-network attacks, including selective forwarding, black-hole and DoS. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed node self-monitoring mechanism.","2160-1283;21601283","","10.1109/ICISE.2010.5691634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5691634","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Manganese;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","24","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives. Our scheme evaluates trustworthiness from three perspectives: collaboration trust, behavioral trust, and reference trust. Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions.

Foreseen applications include safety applications, traffic efficiency enhancements, and infotainment services. To make future deployment successful, it is imperative that all applications are matched with proper security mechanisms. Current proposals mostly focus on entity authorization by establishing a public key infrastructure. Such proactive security efficiently excludes nonauthorized entities from the network. However, in the face of insider attackers possessing valid key material, we need to consider data-centric methods to complement entity-centric trust. A promising approach for consistency checks, particularly in multihop scenarios, is to exploit redundant information dissemination. If information is received from both honest and malicious vehicles, chances are that attacks can be detected. In this paper, we propose three graph-based metrics to gauge the redundancy of dissemination protocols. We apply our metrics to a baseline protocol, a geocast protocol, and an aggregation protocol using extensive simulations. In addition, we point out open issues and applications of the metrics, such as colluding attackers and eviction of attacker nodes based on detected attacks. Results show that Advanced Adaptive Geocast behaves almost optimally from a routing efficiency point of view but fails to offer sufficient redundancy for data consistency mechanisms in many scenarios. The simulated aggregation protocol shows sufficient redundancy to facilitate data consistency checking.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2236117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392305","Data consistency;graph theory;protocol analysis;vehicular networks (VANETs)","Bandwidth;Measurement;Protocols;Redundancy;Safety;Sensors;Vehicles","data integrity;graph theory;information dissemination;protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET multihop data dissemination protocols;aggregation protocol;attacker node eviction;colluding attackers;consistency checks;data consistency checking;data-centric methods;entity authorization;entity-centric trust;geocast protocol;graph-based metrics;honest vehicles;infotainment services;insider attack detection;malicious vehicles;public key infrastructure;redundant information dissemination;safety applications;security mechanisms;traffic efficiency enhancements;vehicular networks","","8","","31","","20121221","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance.

However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach).

IEEE International Symposium on","","2008","","","32","43","This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).","","","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736","","Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn","computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion","","4","","22","","","20-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These technologies have support of one of famous technique known as Adhoc Network. Adhoc Networks are assortment of mobile nodes connected by wireless links and also receiving attention in the scientific community. In adhoc networks, routes may be disconnected due to dynamic movement of nodes. So, route selection and topology combination is very difficult and challenging issue. Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account. Proposed method optimizes the routing issues by using AODV. The result of this paper is an appropriate solution against neighbor attacks.","","","10.1109/EAIT.2011.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734955","AODV;MANETs;adhoc routing;flow capacity;ns2;relative position;signal strength","Ad hoc networks;Equations;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","Internet;mobile ad hoc networks;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology","GNDA;Internet technology;MANET;adhoc routing protocol;communication technology;flow capacity;good neighbor node detection;mobile node assortment;network topology;signal strength;wireless link;wireless technology","","0","","14","","","19-20 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable. Simulations with real Internet traffic show that the storage requirements of our proposed schemes are one to two orders of magnitude lower.","","","10.1109/ICC.2004.1312653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1312653","","Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication links;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bloom filters;IP traceback;Internet security;Internet traffic;destination addresses;distributed denial of service;link capacity;packet digesting schemes;packet sharing;packet streams;source addresses;transit packets","","8","1","17","","","20-24 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This relatively predictable working flow make it easy to build accurate node profiles and detect any violation of normal profiles. In this paper, traffic patterns observed are used to model node behavior in wireless sensor networks. Firstly, selected traffic related features are used to translate observed packets into different events. Following this, unique patterns based on the arriving order of different packet events are extracted to form the normal profile for each sensor node during the profile learning stage.

Based on the principle that networks should allow users to focus on data, rather than having a reference to a physical location where that data is, the adoption of new paradigms can be justified. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm that gives a potential improvement to content distribution, such as local content caching, which helps to reduce delay and increase delivery speed. From another point of view, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) defines a new Internet architecture where network devices are simple and the control plane is managed by a centralized controller, providing an inexpensive and reliable architecture. This paper presents ContentSDN, an architecture that integrates ICN and SDN, providing transparent in-network caching for content delivery. ContentSDN uses the concept of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), allowing network orchestration and high scalability at runtime. Content caching is driven by manageable policies that can be adjusted according to business needs. The proposed architecture has been evaluated on an emulated environment where multiple users request content through the HTTP protocol. Results show that ContentSDN improves the Quality of Experience and make a more efficient use of network resources.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/AINA.2016.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474135","Information-Centric Networking (ICN);Network Functions Virtualization (NFV);Software-Defined Networking (SDN)","Computer architecture;Control systems;IP networks;Internet;Proposals;Protocols","Internet;computer architecture;content management;quality of experience;software defined networking;transport protocols;virtualisation","ContentSDN;HTTP protocol;ICN;Internet paradigm;NFV;business needs;content distribution;content-based paradigm;content-based transparent proxy architecture;information-centric networking;location-based paradigm;network functions virtualization;quality of experience;software-defined networking","","","","25","","","23-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hellas, Heraklion, Greece","Network and System Security, 2009. NSS '09. Third International Conference on","","2009","","","107","114","Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX). We also evaluate OMP's performance by simulations and compare it with the minimum cost planning using Dijkstra algorithm to show its advantages.","0190-3918;01903918","","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599120","Disjoint Path;Maximum-Flow Minimum-Cost Planning;Smart Home;Wireless Sensor and Actor Network","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Planning;Smart homes;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","fault tolerance;home computing;path planning;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Dijkstra algorithm;Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm;Goldberg minimum cost flow algorithm;Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm;actor networks;actor nodes;expected transmission count;fault-tolerance;intrusion detection system;intrusion event notification;node-disjoint paths;optimal multipath planning;sensor nodes;smart homes;timeliness issues;wireless links;wireless sensor","","0","","18","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key benefit of a collaborative approach to intrusion detection is a better view of global network attack activity. Augmenting the information obtained at a single site with information gathered from across the network can provide a more precise model of an attacker's behavior and intent. While many organizations see value in adopting such a collaborative approach, some challenges must be addressed before intrusion detection can be performed on an inter-organizational scale.

"Effective Statistical Detection of Smart Confidentiality Attacks in Multi-Domain Networks","M. Gharbaoui; F. Paolucci; A. Giorgetti; B. Martini; P.

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions. Finally, intra-domain information exposition is evaluated, showing the PAD ability to preserve confidentiality.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.111113.130482","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6662354","BGP;Multi-domain networks;PCE;control plane security;sequential hypothesis testing;traffic engineering","Computer architecture;Network security;Network topology;Quality of service;Statistical analysis","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;message authentication;quality of service;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","PAD;PCE anomaly detector;PCE architecture;QoS-enabled end-to-end connectivity services;SHT;TE solutions;anomaly-based approach;attack patterns;authentication;authorization;bogus requests;encryption;end-to-end path computations;information confidentiality;inter-PCE path computation;intradomain information exposition;intradomain information exposure;malicious PCE;malicious utilization detection;multidomain multiprovider networks;network load conditions;network providers;path computation element;security leak;sequential hypothesis testing;smart confidentiality attacks;statistical classification procedure;statistical detection;traffic engineering","","1","","","","20131112","December 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

MobiQuitous '09. 6th Annual International","","2009","","","1","10","The increasingly deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) challenge traditional network management systems because of the shared open medium and the varying channel conditions. There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","2","1","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies and notifies other nodes in the network to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. Numerous schemes have been proposed for intrusion detection and response systems, for ad hoc networks. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. In this paper, we examine the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and argue that we must include intrusion detection in the security architecture for mobile computing environment. We propose a mIDS (mobile intrusion detection system) suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, which detects nodes misbehavior, anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. mIDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes. Simple rules are designed to identify the misbehavior nodes. Theproess of identyfing the misbehavior node is carried out by a special node called a monitor node.

Protected servers are hidden inside a secure overlay network only accessible through a set of access-nodes (AN) with rate limiting and access control functionalities. Protected servers are required to provide at least one dummy public server as an initial connection step point. An experimental prototype is implemented and tested. Results show; system compatibility with e-commerce websites needs, also, the AN impact on the protected server performance is less than 10% reduction in file transfer throughput, in addition, the public server could survive attack rates more than 10 times higher than an ordinary server.

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2008.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182","Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity","Application software;Availability;Computer architecture;Information systems;Internet;Open systems;Protection;Resilience;Service oriented architecture;Web server","Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data","Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability","","14","","27","","20080202","Jan.-March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, a new self-learning strategy for selecting target addresses during malware propagation was introduced in [1], which we refer to as importance scanning. Under the importance-scanning approach, malware employs an address sampling scheme to search for the underlying group distribution of (vulnerable) hosts in the address space through which it propagates. The malware utilizes this information to increase the rate at which it locates viable addresses during its search for infection targets. In this paper, we introduce a strategy to combat importance scanning propagation.We propose the use of white hole networks, which combine several existing components to dissuade, slow, and ultimately halt the propagation of importance scanning malware. Based on analytical reasoning and simulations using real trace and address distribution information, we demonstrate how the white hole approach can provide an effective defense, even when the deployment of this countermeasure represents a very small fraction of the address space population.","","","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550340","","Aggregates;Analytical models;Computer networks;Computer worms;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Routing;Sampling methods","","","","2","","38","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X;1553877X","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","8","","243","","20141231","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This leads to traffic overhead and wastage of bandwidth utilisation. In order to overcome these issues, ant-based DDoS detection technique using roaming virtual honeypots is proposed. In this technique, virtual roaming honeypot along with the multi-level secure architecture is used to collect the information about the various intruders at different levels in the network. Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot. This information is sent to the honeypot to make a defence system against the attackers. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it provides a full defence against DDoS at multi-level without creating any traffic overhead.","1751-8628;17518628","","10.1049/iet-com.2015.0497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470964","","","IP networks;ant colony optimisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","ant colony optimisation technique;ant-based DDoS detection technique;ant-based distributed denial-of-service detection technique;bandwidth utilisation wastage;defence system;intruder detection;multilevel IP log table;multilevel secure architecture;pheromone deposit;roaming virtual honeypots;traffic overhead","","","","","","","5 19 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Therefore it is important to find methods to reduce that amount of data for applications like long-term archiving or filtering in mediators to improve scalability. A fact that helps here is, that general internet traffic has power-law characteristics and that for many applications it is enough to only look at the large flows. In this work we introduce Mouse Trapping, a flow data reduction method that keeps the large flow records, while the small flow records are aggregated or even removed. We show based on theoretical simulation, that because of the heavy-tail nature of normal flow data, the main part of the traffic is represented by only a few large flow records, while the small flow records represent only a small part of the traffic. In an evaluation with real traffic data we can confirm that the traffic flows are in fact mostly power-law distributed. We can show that with this method, flow data can be reduced by up to 90% if all small flow records are just discarded, affecting only flow records of 5% of the traffic.","","","10.1109/ICIMP.2008.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561321","flows;network measurement;power-law;reduction","Computerized monitoring;Filtering;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Internet;Mice;Protection;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","data analysis;data reduction;traffic","flow based traffic measurement;flow data reduction method;flow records;mouse trapping;network management;power-law distributed","","2","1","15","","","June 29 2008-July 5 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various wakeup scheduling schemes have been proposed to save energy by employing duty cycles and to reduce end-to-end delay by synchronizing nodes' wakeup times and shortening setup latencies. Most sensor applications incur a predominant ""convergecast"" traffic pattern in which several close-by sensor nodes simultaneously send reports to the base station, which generates ""spatially-correlated contention."" This contention, specific to sensor networks, can significantly prolong delay, degrade throughput, and impair energy-efficiency. However, most wakeup scheduling and MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks did not address this contention and can be adversely affected. We propose a distributed topology control technique to schedule nodes' wakeup time slots, and design a MAC protocol to benefit from this topology control for improving energy-efficiency and delay, and efficiently handling spatially-correlated contention. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our topology control and MAC can either reduce the end- to-end delay by roughly half or extend the network lifetime by three times, when compared against the nearest competing approach, and achieves twice the throughput under spatially-correlated contention.","2155-5486;21555486","","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292842","","Base stations;Degradation;Delay;Distributed control;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;wireless sensor networks","MAC protocol;distributed topology control;end- to-end delay;sleep-based topology control;wakeup scheduling;wireless sensor networks","","11","","28","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, alert correlation techniques are used to provide a complementary analysis to link elementary alerts and provide a more global intrusion view. We propose an alert correlation and aggregation framework based on requires/provides model. The objective is to discover the logical relationships between atomic alerts potentially incorporated in multi-stage attacks.

In this work, we focus the exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.15.4 low rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) MAC layer. This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior.

Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","1530-0889;15300889","","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","39","3","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing works focus on actively detecting malicious nodes by verifying signal correlation or behavior consistency. It may not work well in large-scale social networks since the number of users is extremely large and the difference between normal users and malicious users is inconspicuous. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of users to perform the detection task. We design incentive mechanisms to encourage the participation of users under two scenarios: full information and partial information. In full information scenario, we design a specific incentive scheme for users according to their preferences, which can provide the desirable detection result and minimize overall cost. In partial information scenario, assuming that we only have statistical information about users, we first transform the incentive mechanism design to an optimization problem, and then design the optimal incentive scheme under different system parameters by solving the optimization problem. We perform extensive simulations to validate the analysis and demonstrate the impact of system factors on the overall cost.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2560518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462258","crowdsourcing;largescale networks.;malicious users detection","Correlation;Crowdsourcing;Incentive schemes;Internet of things;Optimization;Sensors;Social network services","","","","","","","","20160428","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We propose the deployment of ""distributed network security sensors (DNSS)"" distributed among the nodes of the internal network to monitor traffic of the internal network. We study the tradeoff between deployment cost and monitoring coverage to determine the locations and processing rates of security sensors. Because of the uncertain nature of flow rates, we build a fuzzy optimization model and develop a hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve the problem. Using an actual network topology, we check the relationships among the deployment cost, sensors deployment, and the monitoring coverage. The results demonstrate that a small number of low-speed sensors are sufficient to maintain high monitoring coverage in a high-speed network.","1531-2216;15312216","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635543","Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS);fuzzy optimization;network monitoring","Computer science;Computer security;Costs;High-speed networks;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","deployment strategy;distributed network security sensors;fuzzy optimization model;hybrid intelligent algorithm;network access aggregation;network intrusion detection systems","","1","","17","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has got so much of importance because of the high optimization of IT resources as a service to the consumers on demand with high availability, flexibility, reliability and scalability. Cloud computing basically converts the desktop computing into service level computing using remote servers or huge datacenter. The cloud computing has lended many user friendly features in terms of various services available through internet but the harsh reality about cloud computing is that they are prone to security threat attacks. One of the major concerning security threats is called Distributed Denial of service attack (DDOS). DDOS attack destroys the ability of the system to provide service by overwhelming the bandwidth of network device and saturating the computation resources of service provider. This paper describes experimental analysis of impact of flooding DDOS attack in cloud environment through simulation in cloudsim. In this experiment we will be defining Infrastructure as service (IaaS) in cloudsim and this IaaS will be deployed in Eucalyptus cloud suite.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","4","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This distributed security model adopts a bottom-up approach such that each cluster of end-user hosts is first secured using the CSG architecture. These different CSGs are then centrally managed by the Network Administrator. A file-based firewall update mechanism is used for dynamic real-time security. IPsec is used to secure the firewall policy update distribution while X.509 certificates cater for sender/receiver authentication. The major benefits of this approach to distributed security include tamper resistance, anti-spoofing, anti-sniffing, secure real-time firewall updating, low overall network load, high scalability and low firewall convergence times.","2155-2487;21552487","","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808875","Layer 2 per-packet load balancing;distributed cluster security;distributed firewall;stateful CSG architecture","Authentication;Convergence;Filtering;Load management;Protection;Prototypes;Robustness;Scalability;Security;Software prototyping","authorisation;distributed processing","cluster security gateway architecture;distributed firewall architecture;dynamic real-time security;file-based firewall update mechanism;firewall policy update distribution;network administrator;receiver authentication;robust distributed security;sender authentication","","2","","31","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes.

Among hardware approaches, memory-based architecture has attracted a lot of attention because of its easy reconfigurability and scalability. In order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful network intrusion detection system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement. For Snort rule sets, the new algorithm achieves 21% of memory reduction compared with the traditional Aho-Corasick algorithm.

The various personal information sharing practices that social network providers promote have led to their success as innovative social interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it. The proposed event collector framework can collect all posted information and store it in a relational database for further analysis. Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour. Since each event is stored with its corresponding timestamp, it is possible to perform an efficient analysis of all posted contents, compute statistics over collected data, infer/establish the so called ""normal"" or ""typical"" usage profile and, thus, be able to detect possible deviations that may correspond to a compromised user account.","","","10.1109/NETWKS.2014.6959218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6959218","Monitoring Framework;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Databases;Facebook;Privacy;Security;Servers;Web pages","graphical user interfaces;relational databases;social networking (online)","daily digital interactions;graphical user interface;innovative social interaction platforms;relational database;social network events collection;user behaviour analysis","","0","","11","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to lack of information, it can be quite difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems to identify such attacks in progress. Cooperative intrusion detection, on the basis of information sharing, is proved as a necessary measure to detect widespread attacks by other researcher D. Frincke (2000), Polla, D. et al., (1998). This paper presents a cooperative approach for intrusion detection that provides a method for individual ID components working cooperatively to perform concerted detections. Being constructed on the basis of ID components, CoIDS can adopt both existed (usually more mature) and new ID techniques. This makes CoIDS extensible and scalable. In addition, an ID component is essentially an autonomous agent, which makes CoIDS available with certain loss of functionality even when the intrusion detection manager does not work. Its reliability is also improved because failure of one ID component will not cause any other to stop working. Furthermore, it improved the accuracy of detection for conventional intrusions by validating analysis result with data from different ID components.","0840-7789;08407789","","10.1109/CCECE.2003.1226031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1226031","","Autonomous agents;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Data analysis;Decision making;Internetworking;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Prototypes;Wide area networks","Internet;cooperative systems;internetworking;safety systems","Internet;autonomous agent;computer system;concerted detection;cooperative intrusion detection system;individual ID component;information sharing;internetworking;multiple host;multiple network;widespread attack detection","","1","2","13","","","4-7 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The self configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among the critical situation such as military use and emergency recovery. But due to open medium and broad distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to different attacks. So to protect MANET from various attacks, it is important to develop an efficient and secure system for MANET. Intrusion means any set of actions that attempt to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a resource. Intrusion Prevention is the primary defense because it is the first step to make the systems secure from attacks by using passwords, biometrics etc. Even if intrusion prevention methods are used, the system may be subjected to some vulnerability. So we need a second wall of defense known as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), to detect and produce responses whenever necessary.

A modelbased thermal anomaly detection mechanism, which compares expected (obtained using heat-generation and -extraction models) and observed thermal maps (obtained using thermal cameras) of datacenters, is proposed. In addition, a novel Thermal Anomaly-aware Resource Allocation (TARA) is designed to induce a time-varying thermal fingerprint (thermal map) of the datacenter so to maximize the detection accuracy of the anomalies. As shown via experiments on a small-scale testbed as well as via trace-driven simulations, such model-based thermal anomaly detection solution in conjunction with TARA significantly improves the detection probability compared to anomaly detection when scheduling algorithms such as random, round robin, and best-fit-decreasing are employed.","2168-7161;21687161","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2481423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274707","Anomaly detection;green datacenters;heat imbalance;high-performance computing;virtualization","Cooling;Heating;Histograms;Servers;Temperature measurement;Thermal sensors","","","","","","","","20150923","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Modern ID techniques must cope with increasingly sophisticated attacks as well as rapidly rising network line speeds. Signature based ID is forced to sample sparsely, increasing the likelihood of malicious traffic entering the network without scrutiny. Con sequently, flow-based ID is gaining attention as an effective complement. ID systems are furthermore often characterized as either network-based or host-based. The autonomous multi agent design paradigm is a scalable, attractive alternative for its potential to leverage the strengths of both architectures: the broad perspective and visibility into distributed malicious activity provided by network-based ID, and the comprehensive view of the local node provided by host-based ID. This paper therefore develops an architecture for a new multi agent, flow-based intrusion detection sysem. The architecture is designed in two iterations of increasing complexity. These innovative ID designs use a ""repuation"" system to permit agents to dynamically find nodes that are most effective for classifying malicious network activity. Furthermore, each system design includes the development of an innovative classifier that uses multi objective evolutionary algorithms to aid in the search for effective operational parameter values. Evaluation using an extensive agent simulation framework highlights the conditions under which the reputation system provides a significant classification benefit.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949798","","Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Object oriented modeling;Pattern recognition;Peer to peer computing","computer network security;multi-agent systems;telecommunication traffic","autonomous multiagent design;computer network protection;flow-based ID;flow-based intrusion detection;malicious network activity classification;malicious traffic;network attack classification;signature-based ID","","3","2","17","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even with the recent emergence of cloud technology, most of cloud applications are accessed and controlled through web interfaces. Web security has therefore continued to be fundamentally important and extremely challenging. One major security issue of web applications is SQL-injection attacks. Most existing solutions for detecting these attacks use log analysis, and employ either pattern matching or machine learning methods. Pattern matching methods can be effective, dynamic, they however cannot detect new kinds of attacks. Supervised machine learning methods can detect new attacks, yet they need to rely on an off-line training phase. This work proposes a multi-stage log analysis architecture, which combines both pattern matching and supervised machine learning methods. It uses logs generated by the application during attacks to effectively detect attacks and to help preventing future attacks. The architecture is described in detail, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented and hosted on Amazon AWS, using Kibana for pattern matching and Bayes Net for machine learning. It is evaluated on 10,000 logs for detecting SQL injection attacks. Experiment results show that the two-stage system has combined the advantages of both systems, and has substantially improved the detection accuracy. The proposed work is significant in advancing web securities, while the multi-stage log analysis concept would be highly applicable to many intrusion detection applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8286-1; POD:978-1-4673-8287-8","10.1109/IACC.2016.141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544930","Log Analysis;Pattern Matching;SQL injection;Supervised Machine Learning;Text Classification;Web Security","Cloud computing;Data visualization;Databases;Learning systems;Pattern matching;Security;Training","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;security of data","Amazon AWS;Bayes net;Kibana;SQL injection attacks detection;Web attacks detection;Web interfaces;Web security;Web-based applications;academic communities;attacks prevention;cloud applications;cloud technology;commercial communities;government communities;intrusion detection;multistage log analysis architecture;pattern matching;proof-of-concept prototype;social communities;supervised machine learning","","","","","","","27-28 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One compelling example, proposed in this paper, is the case of whitelists for DDoS mitigation, where domains broadcast, for each possible DDoS target (!), the set of legitimate customers (client IP addresses) whose traffic should not be blocked while a DDoS attack is in progress. However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers. In a previous work, we proposed a cryptographic approach called “conditional data sharing”, devised to permit disclosure of cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets of network monitoring data, only when a threshold number of domains are ready to reveal their data. In this paper, we cast such technique to a realistic scenario of whitelist sharing for DDoS mitigation, and we significantly extend the underlying cryptographic approach so as to support disclosure not only for threshold-based policies, but for more general (monotone) access structures.","2166-0077;21660077","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824986","","Access control;Computer crime;Conferences;Cryptography;IP networks;Monitoring","computer network security;cryptography","DDoS mitigation;Internet-scale attacks;client IP addresses;competitor domains;conditional data sharing;cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets;cryptographic approach;defensive techniques;domains broadcast;legitimate customers;network monitoring data;network security data sharing;privacy concerns;threshold-based policies;whitelist sharing","","0","","39","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases.

In our approach we consider that a nervous system design and organization is a constructive process carried out by genetic information encoded in DNA. Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones. Our method was initially tested on a simple, but non-trivial, XOR problem. We also submit our method to two other problems of increasing complexity: Prediction of the effect of a new drug on Breast Cancer and KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Some advantages of the proposed methodology are that it increases the level of implicit parallelism of the GA and seems to be capable of generating minimal satisfactory neural architectures, resulting in a reduction of project costs and increasing the performance of the evolved ANN, suggesting a promising potential for future applications.","2161-4393;21614393","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280535","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Genomics;Legged locomotion;RNA","DNA;genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","ANN;DNA;KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset;L-system;Lindenmayer System;NEA;artificial neural networks;biologically inspired neuroevolutive algorithm;breast cancer drug;constructive process;evolutionary computation;evolutionary process;genetic algorithm;genetic information encoding;hierarchical neural structures;minimal satisfactory neural architectures;modular neural structures;nervous system design;neural codification;nontrivial XOR problem;project cost reduction;recurrent neural structures;recursive substructure composition","","","","29","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Critical challenges of these applications are the increasing level of inter-component dependencies and the customized growth, which make recurrent deployment of such applications, as the one required in private clouds, labor intensive and error prone. In this paper we investigate the type of issues faced when deploying a cloud computing management infrastructure and propose a solution to self-assist the deployment.

Actually, managing MANETspsila security is a hard challenge due to the inherent complexity and the tremendous number of parameters which should be considered. To provide efficient security management, we focus on three main parameters: the secured device capabilities, the associated network security and the secured applications. The solution we propose, named Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a scalable, flexible and application-oriented framework able to manage security depending on the application requirements and the network security conditions. ASMA is based on a structure called macrograph combining both dynamic trust management and multipath routing. The macrograph structure is capable to estimate transmission security in order to assure that communications are established only when they match applications security requirements. ASMA flexibility offers compliance with most on-demand routing protocols and security tools. In this paper we present simulation results for ASMA associated with AOMDV (a multipath declination of AODV) routing protocol and compare results with AOMDV.

Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published. In this study, we emphasize the importance, for the network research community, to use and contribute to the development of open source measurement tools. In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters.

Deployment and runtime cost due to the defensive systems will affect the normal function of smart grid system without careful planning and design. This paper is an effort to address this issue. In particular, we apply the set packing algorithm to optimize (minimize) the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a Dijkstra's based optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing between the communications of the nodes.

Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs.

Such applications typically comprise a complex pipeline of processing components that capture, transform and analyze the incoming data stream. In addition, applications must provide high throughput, be scalable and easily modifiable so that new analytical components can be added with minimum effort. In this paper we describe the MeDICi integration framework (MIF), which is a middleware platform we have created to address these challenges. The MIF extends an open source messaging platform with a component-based API for integrating components into analytical pipelines. We describe the features and capabilities of the MIF, and show how it has been used to build a production analytical application for detecting cyber security attacks. The application was composed from multiple independently developed components using several different programming languages. The resulting application was able to process network sensor traffic in real time and provide insightful feedback to network analysts as soon as potential attacks were recognized.","","","10.1109/WICSA.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459148","component model;integration;pipelines","Application software;Computer security;Data analysis;Independent component analysis;Middleware;Performance analysis;Pipelines;Production;Software engineering;Throughput","data analysis;middleware;object-oriented programming;pipeline processing;security of data","API;MeDICi integration framework;cyber security attack detection;high performance data streaming application;middleware;network sensor traffic;open source messaging platform;pipeline processing component;production analytical application;programming language;software engineering problem","","11","","22","","","18-21 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","","2008","","","321","327","Millions of users divulge their personal information on phishing web sites, which causes over a billion dollars loss every year. Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism. Our evaluation results show that our proposed decentralized CIDS is more effective than a fully centralized system.","","","10.1109/NOMSW.2007.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509966","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Gold;Government;Intrusion detection;Iron;Laboratories;Software engineering","Internet;Web sites;groupware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet service provider;Web sites;fast-flux network;peer-to-peer network;self-healing collaborative intrusion detection architecture;self-protecting collaborative intrusion detection architecture;trace-back fast-flux phishing domain","","4","","25","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously. Experimental results with the 1999 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation (IDEVAL) data confirm that ENNs are promising tools for intrusion detection.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.860136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634649","Anomaly detection;computer security;evolutionary algorithms;intrusion detection system (IDS);neural networks","Computer security;Data security;Evolutionary computation;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Pattern matching;Statistics","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;anomaly detection;evolutionary neural network;intrusion detection;machine learning techniques;program behavior;system-call audit data;system-call sequences","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Evolution;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","28","","25","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While combining our disparate devices to meet future needs is challenging, it will also allow for better exploitation of networked devices to provide obvious benefits to the consumer.

The proposed approach aims at reducing the operation and maintenance cost of the system by using a messaging network enhanced with the capability to store, inspect and analyze selected portions of the exchanged messages under the strict control of security and privacy. Complexity makes any information system vulnerable to design flaws, operation error, and security problems. The proposed approach facilitates analyzing these problems associated with complex SOA systems through the message-store analysis.

This system provides solution to identify anomalous activities like scan and flood attack by means of automatic behavior analysis of the network traffic and also give detailed information of attacker, victim, type and time of the attack which can be used for corresponding defense. Anomaly Detection capability of the proposed system is compared with SNORT Intrusion detection system and results prove the very high detection rate of the system over SNORT for different scan and flood attack. The proposed system detects different stealth scan and malformed packets scan. Since the probability of using stealth scan in real attack is very high, this system can identify the real attacks in the initial stage itself and preventive action can be taken.","","","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5422996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422996","Anomaly detection;chi-square;flow;scan detection","Computer networks;Floods;High-speed networks;IP networks;Information analysis;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","IDS;IPS;SNORT intrusion detection system;automatic behavior analysis;chi-square technique;firewall;flow based anomaly detection system;intrusion detection;malicious traffic;network traffic;security mechanisms","","0","","22","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

The intrusion features are represented as graph-ere nodes, with the edges between them denoting the adding of the next feature. Ants traverse through the graph to add nodes until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The fisher discrimination rate is adopted as the heuristic information for ants' traversal. In order to avoid training of a large number of SVM classifier, the least square based SVM estimation is adopted. Initially, the SVM is trained based on grid search method to obtain discrimination function using the training data based on all features available. Then the feature subset produced during the ACO search process is evaluated based on their abilities to reconstruct the reference discriminative function using linear least square estimation. Finally SVM is retrained using the train data based on the obtained optimal feature subset to obtain intrusion detection model. The MIT's KDD Cup 99 dataset is used to evaluate our present method, the results clearly demonstrate that the method can be an effective way for intrusion feature selection and detection.","2160-133X;2160133X","","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527615","Network intrusion detection;ant colony optimization;feature selection;machine learning;support vector machines","Ant colony optimization;Computer vision;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Least squares approximation;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;optimisation;search problems;security of data;support vector machines","SVM training;ant colony optimization;discrimination function;grid search method;least square based SVM estimation;machine learning;network intrusion feature detection;network intrusion feature selection;support vector machine","","5","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the capabilities of cloud computing environment create challenges concerning the security of data applications and its systems. In this respect, security issues are present on big data applications. By adopting the cloud computing environment, the provider has to incorporate security systems and policies in its infrastructure in order to mitigate the security threats. In this paper, multilayered security architecture is defined based on defense in depth. In this architecture the cloud infrastructure is divided into defense zones to achieve better security control. Additionally, intrusion detection system (IDS), honeypots and firewalls are incorporated alongside the defense mechanisms of the cloud infrastructure.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision. We conclude our paper with properties and recommendations for IDSs working for WSNs and some future works.","2324-898X;2324898X","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296068","Energy consumption;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Byzantine generals problem;IDS;WSN lifetime;attack detection;encryption;environmental data monitoring;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network lifetime;oral message algorithm;prevention measures;security challenges;spatial distributed autonomous sensors;wireless sensor network","","0","","42","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607;15503607","","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","3","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections.

According to the trust model in social networks, this paper proposes an efficient scheme which is resilient to both fault and intrusion based on trust relationship for IP networks. This scheme not only borrows the trust rating from the social links, but also qualitatively describes the relationships between the trust rating and the network behavior. Then, this paper analyses the scheme how to tolerate three known malicious behaviors, viz., self-faults, bad mouth attacks and conflict behavior attacks.

The proposed SSF algorithm uses a tiny data structure, and is light-computational and cache- resident. It can be implemented efficiently in a software-based platform. Experimental results show that with Snort's patterns, the computation time of the SSF with the AC algorithm to process the Defcon9 trace is only one-third to half of that of a pure AC algorithm.

Although CC promises to make life much easier for the user, it comes with significant security issues. Because on-demand service provisioning for applications and data will be used by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of users simultaneously, a successful intrusion would not only expose sensitive data, but it could also completely cut users off from both applications and/or data. This paper examines the underlying security risks inherent to the CC paradigm, compares approaches to mitigate known security risks, and offers a solution that leverages intelligent multi-agent systems and network data ontologies to provide automated defense for both known and unknown malware security risks.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms other well-known machine-learning models used in the same detection task, namely, sequential minimal optimization, deep neural network, C4.5, reduced error pruning tree, and randomTree.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2490802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312964","Botnet intrusion detection;efficient learning;ensembles;feature selection;machine-learning (ML)","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms","computer network security;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","PI-IDS;RDPLM;T-IDS;active attacks;active intrusion;attack signatures;benchmark botnet dataset;botnet intrusion detection;cluster-based partitioning;compact network feature set;critical detection-rate;distributed platform;feature selection techniques;intrusion detection system;multiple randomized meta-learning technique;network traffic;packet encryption;packet header analysis;payload-inspection-based IDS;randomized data partitioned learning model;remotely-controlled compromised machines;subspacing technique;traffic-based IDS;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol packet payload","","","","53","","20151030","Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application.

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores.

We propose a memory-efficient multiple-character-approaching architecture consisting of multiple parallel deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called TDP-DFA. By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity. We also present a novel scheme to share the storage of transition rules among multiple DFAs, substantially decreasing the total storage cost, and avoiding the cost increase being proportional to the number of DFAs.

International","","2004","","","48","52","Nowadays the importance of intrusion detection is amplified due to the incredible increase in the number of attacks on the networks. The ubiquity of the Internet and the easy perpetration of attacks will lead to more hostile traffic. With the advent of high-speed Internet connections, organizations today find it difficult to detect intrusions. So multi sensor intrusion detection systems are inevitable. The optimum distribution of traffic to the sensors is a challenging task. We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced.

In this paper, we advocate content parsing to empower SDN with finer grained control ability over traffic. Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","1","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can deliver satisfactory system performance with less network load.","2329-6267;23296267","","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356567","","Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis","security of data","DARPA dataset;attack tools;collaborative architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;network technologies;noncentral analyzer;one-level hierarchy dIDS;security","","1","","31","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced. Simulation results and PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) values of each node clearly shows better network performance in case of security scheme in presence of Jamming attack.","2347-9337;23479337","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012891","AOMDV;Attack;MANET;Routing;Security","Bandwidth;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","jamming;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDR;enhanced security scheme;jamming attack;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing protocol AOMDV;network topology;packet delivery ratio;security design;unauthorized packets","","1","","8","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are some challenges associated with the idea of collaborative detection, such as scalability and avoidance of a central point of failure.

However, the tremendous boom of these networks depends incontestably on their reliability in terms of security and quality of services (QoS). In this paper, we study the ad hoc security vulnerabilities for which cryptographic-based solutions are ineffective and which require IDS. Appropriate designed IDS services appear essential as countermeasures to those threats, where previous IDS proposals often seem to be too sophisticated in the ad hoc environment and merely ineffective. Our goal here is to provide an IDS mechanism dedicated to the OLSR protocol, fitting to its characteristics and operation, and designed to avoid its vulnerabilities.

The protocol specifies the behavior of concurrently executing processes. This concurrency creates a new class of subtle issues. One technique to address these issues is the finite state machine (FSM). SigSec captures the signaling protocol messages and forwards them to the appropriate protocol analyzer in addition to saving them to a database.

In this paper, a novel IP traceback approach based on packet logging and deterministic packet marking (LDPM) is proposed, that significantly improves IP traceback in several aspects: (1) LDPM is built on a distributed hierarchical IP traceback system, and is simple to deploy. (2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers.

"Hamming distance as a metric for the detection of CRC-based side-channel communications in 802.11 wireless networks","V. Chea; M. V. Martin; R.

However, like many technologies, there are ways that it can be exploited. One of these ways is through side-channel communication, whereby secret messages are passed along by the purposeful corruption of frames. These side channels can be established by intentionally corrupting the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field by using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) polynomial that is different from the standard CRC polynomial. Malicious nodes can exploit the fact that normal unsuspecting nodes will drop these frames since they appear as naturally corrupted frames. This paper presents a CRC Hamming distance metric as a feature for the detection of this type of side-channel communication. The proposed detection method applies the Hamming distance measure to compare CRC values that are generated by different CRC polynomials. The hypothesis is that the mean Hamming distance between two CRC values generated by two different CRC polynomials would be significantly far apart than the mean Hamming distance of a CRC value of a frame that was naturally corrupted but was generated by the same CRC polynomial. The results of our real data experiments show that the there is a consistent and significant difference between the mean Hamming values of naturally corrupted frames to those that use the Koopman polynomial to calculate the CRC for side-channel communications. The analysis of the results also demonstrate that the difference of the CRC values that have the the maximum F-Score vary between 10-14 under varying noisy conditions and side-channel throughput.","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346831","","Generators;Hamming distance;MATLAB;Noise measurement;Polynomials;Wireless communication","Hamming codes;cryptography;cyclic redundancy check codes;polynomials;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless network;CRC polynomial;CRC-based side-channel communication detection;F-score;FCS;Hamming distance;Koopman polynomial;cyclic redundancy check;frame check sequence;malicious node;mobility characteristic;noisy condition;secret message;side-channel throughput","","2","","12","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a large monitoring environment where targets are distributed over an entire monitored region, deploying static sensors leads to high hardware costs because a high number of sensors may be required to achieve network connectivity. This paper considers the target-patrol issue where a set of mobile data mules (DMs) are dispatched to efficiently patrol the given targets under a predefined time constraint. The targets are assigned weights indicating their importance, where more important targets should be visited more frequently by the DMs. Accordingly, this paper proposes a time-constrained weighted targets patrolling (TCWTP) algorithm for locally constructing efficient patrol paths, thereby ensuring globally stable intervals between visits to all target points. A performance analysis revealed that the proposed TCWTP mechanism outperforms existing works in terms of the average interval between visits, quality of monitoring satisfaction ratio, and monitoring fairness ratio.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2014.2378212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000577","Data collection;sweep coverage;target coverage;target {coverage};weighted target patrolling;wireless mobile sensor networks (WMSNs);wireless mobile sensor {networks} (WMSNs)","Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Time factors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile communication;wireless sensor networks","DM;TCWTP algorithm;deploying static sensors;mobile data mules;monitored region;monitoring environment;monitoring fairness ratio;monitoring satisfaction ratio;time constrained weighted targets patrolling;time constrained weighted targets patrolling mechanism;wireless mobile sensor networks","","0","","31","","20141231","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The security of data transfer via WSN is a challenging issue, especially with the existence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, experimental analysis of the impact of existing DoS attacks on the performance of LEACH protocol, including Flooding attack, Black hole attack and Gray Hole attack will be presented. Secondly, a new DoS attack on LEACH called Scheduling attack will be introduced.

However, while gaining all of the cost and performance benefits of IT, existing IT security challenges are acquired as well. The power grid automation network has inherent security risks due to the fact that the systems and applications in the network were not originally designed for the general IT environment. In this paper, we propose a conceptual layered framework for protecting power grid automation systems against cyber attacks. The following factors are taken into account: 1) integration with existing, legacy systems in a non-intrusive fashion; 2) desirable performance in terms of modularity, scalability, extendibility, and manageability; 3) alignment to the Â¿Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy SectorÂ¿ and the future intelligent power delivery systems.

In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times.

As previously argued, major threats (worms, insiders, and attackers with a toehold) come from inside the local network, rather than outside. Recently, two approaches have arisen to address this threat: ubiquitous deployment of end system monitors and custom hardware to replace switching infrastructure. This paper presents a third way: exploiting the VLAN capabilities of modern switches to enforce that all LAN communications must traverse and meet the approval of an intrusion detection monitor that operates separately from the switches. This architecture can realize two key benefits: (1) deployment and operation in today's enterprise networks without requiring replacement of existing network infrastructure, and (2) the use of highly flexible, commodity PCs for LAN monitoring, rather than algorithms embedded in difficult-to-reprogram custom hardware","","","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198828","","Communication switching;Communication system traffic control;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Monitoring;Personal communication networks;Protection;Switches","local area networks;security of data;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;telecommunication switching","Bro-LAN pervasive network inspection;LAN traffic control;VLAN capabilities;external access links;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system","","0","","3","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes are deployed randomly over an area in order to sense various physical phenomena related parameters. The nodes sense the data within their vicinity and forward the data to the neighboring nodes so as to forward the data towards the base station. However, there may be few malicious nodes present in the network and these nodes falsify the data while communicating. This results in false information gathered by the base station and also exhausting the energy of the nodes in the path. Due to the presence of these untrusted nodes the security of the WSN application is compromised as the false data results in distorted information. So it is necessary to study a trust model, various security threats and their effect on WSN. Trust is essential among the nodes in the WSN so that the data can be forwarded without being modified or distorted. This work examines malicious node attack in the WSN scenario and the energy consumption. In this work TRMsim-WSN simulator has been made use of to model the trust and various security attacks and energy consumption analysis with respective to client nodes, relay nodes and malicious nodes has been carried out.","","","10.1109/ICATCCT.2015.7457012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457012","WSN;malicious;security;trust","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","WSN application;base station;malicious nodes;neighboring nodes;security threats;tiny nodes;trust model;wireless sensor network","","","","18","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although this approach works well in some scenarios, some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due to the limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion and extend the network lifetime, trust-based security schemes need approaches to update the trust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time, a trade-off in terms of packet loss rate, false positives, detection rate, and energy of nodes is needed for network performance. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of trust update frequency on energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters, such as packet transmission rate, packet loss rate, remaining node energy, and rate of link changes, and leverage these parameters to design an Adaptive Trust Update Frequency scheme that takes into account runtime network conditions.

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner. Simulation result in NS-2 accurately predicts the performance of proposed scheme in terms of cluster energy level analysis, routing performance, system performance under varying network conditions.","","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993135","MANET;authentication;clustering;malicious node;services;trust","Artificial neural networks;Automata;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Routing protocols","data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DTV;IMTVCM;NS-2 simulation;ad hoc network;autonomous collection;cluster based MANET;cluster energy level analysis;cluster formation process;cluster head;counter table;data transmission time;dynamic topology;indirect trust value;malicious node;misbehaving node;mobile nodes;routing performance;trust value calculation;wireless links","","0","","12","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is one reason why over 40 proposals, addressing these problems, have been published. Regrettably, not many of these researchers have considered scalability, extensibility and other performance issues by testing their promising prevention techniques in a real network. We find that there are around eight practical frameworks and the aim of this paper is to revisit these countermeasures solutions. We propose a new way of evaluation criteria and a comparative study of the researchers' ideas are being addressed based on the models (if any) used, the network architectures and the results.

By using a dedicated malware for evading detection at the initial attack, an attacker quietly succeeds in setting up a front-line base in the target organization. Communication between the attacker and the base adopts popular protocols to hide its existence. Because conventional countermeasures deployed on the boundary between the Internet and the internal network will not work adequately, monitoring on the internal network becomes indispensable. In this paper, we propose an integrated sandbox system that deploys a secure and transparent proxy to analyze internal malicious network traffic. The adoption of software defined networking technology makes it possible to redirect any internal traffic from/to a suspicious host to the system for an examination of its insidiousness. When our system finds malicious activity, the traffic is blocked. If the malicious traffic is regarded as mandatory, e.g., For controlled delivery, the system works as a transparent proxy to bypass it. For benign traffic, the system works as a transparent proxy, as well. If binary programs are found in traffic, they are automatically extracted and submitted to a malware analysis module of the sandbox. In this way, we can safely identify the intention of the attackers without making them aware of our surveillance.","","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2014.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899231","dynamic analysis;malware;sandbox;targeted attack","Electronic mail;Indexes;Internet;Malware;Protocols;Servers","Internet;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;cyber attacks;integrated sandbox system;internal malicious network traffic analysis;internal networks;malware analysis module;mass infection malware;secure proxy;secure traffic analysis system;software defined networking technology;transparent proxy","","4","","9","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key management for SAN entities and allow scalable data sharing. We use strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities, thereby removing bottlenecks at disks and causing minimal inconvenience to hosts.

Trappe","Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA","Tsinghua Science and Technology","","2015","20","4","364","375","Many cyber physical networks will involve ad hoc deployments utilizing peer-to-peer communications. Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.","","","10.1109/TST.2015.7173452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452","Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation","Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","FVPATA;Fiedler nodes;Fiedler value;Fiedler value power adjustment topology adaption;NS3;OLSR protocol;Puncture-Style Attacks;ad hoc network topology;collision avoidance;graph theory;health-care monitoring;optimized link state routing protocol;peer-to-peer communication;robotic agent;robust ad hoc cyberphysical network;vehicle accident;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","","","","August 2015","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Numerous fault-tolerant approaches have been proposed to effectively achieve this objective in the presence of crash failures. However, such systems struggle with transient late-timing faults - a fault classification challenging to effectively tolerate - that manifests increasingly within large-scale distributed systems. Such faults represent a significant threat towards minimizing soft real-time execution of streaming applications in the presence of failures. This work proposes a fault-tolerant approach for QoS-aware data prediction to tolerate transient late-timing faults. The approach is capable of determining the most effective data prediction algorithm for imposed QoS constraints on a failed stream processor at run-time. We integrated our approach into Apache Storm with experiment results showing its ability to minimize stream processor end-to-end execution time by 61% compared to other fault-tolerant approaches.

We propose an innovative distributed architecture for intrusion detection that is able to provide system administrators with selective and early security warnings. This architecture is suitable to large networks composed by several departments because it leverages hierarchical and peer-to-peer cooperation schemes among distributed NIDSes. Moreover, it embeds a distributed alert ranking system that makes it possible to evaluate the real level of risk represented by a security alert generated by a NIDS, and it allows independent network departments to exchange early warnings about critical threats. Thanks to these features, a system administrator can focus on the few alerts that represent a real threat for the controlled infrastructure and can be notified about the most dangerous intrusions before his department is attacked.","","","10.1109/CIT.2010.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578127","Alert ranking;distributed IDS;early warning;intrusion detection systems","Computer architecture;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers;Software","peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","alert management;distributed alert ranking system;distributed intrusion detection architectures;early security warnings;networked information systems complexity;peer-to-peer cooperation schemes;selective security warnings;system administrators;threat detection","","5","","38","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various kinds of attack have been identified and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious. Some researchers have proposed detection mechanisms for the first type. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection method called delay per hop indication (DelPHI). By observing the delays of different paths to the receiver, the sender is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. This method requires neither synchronized clocks nor special hardware equipped mobile nodes. The performance of DelPHI is justified by simulations.","","","10.1109/ISWPC.2006.1613586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613586","Ad Hoc;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole","Clocks;Communication system security;Data communication;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;data communication;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DelPHI;ad hoc wireless routing protocols;data transmission;delay per hop indication;location-based wireless security system;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc wireless networks;route advertisements;untrusted wireless environment;wormhole attacks;wormhole detection mechanism","","21","","14","","","16-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such a system, once some nodes have been compromised, the attack would be directed by the network topology because compromise of a node may cause the compromise of its neighbors. Furthermore, the attack could be crafty or stealthy, meaning that it would always try not to trigger the intrusion detection alarm of the networked system. In such a setting, a question of particular interest to the system administrator is: What is the quantitative security assurance of the networked system?

Most existing intrusion detection techniques for ad hoc networks are proposed on the network layer. In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations. We validate our work through ns-2 simulations.

Conventional defenses for these attacks are not scalable, are slow to react or introduce an overhead to each routed packet. In this paper, we present FlowFence, a lightweight and fast denial of service detection and mitigation system for Software Defined Networking (SDN). The FlowFence architecture includes routers running daemons to monitor the average occupation of their interfaces to detect congestion conditions, and an SDN controller that coordinates bandwidth assignment of controlled links. The controller limits the flow transmission rate along a path to prevent users' starvation. The mitigation procedure of starvation state allocates an average bandwidth, while flows exceeding the mean are penalized. The penalization is proportional to the difference between the fair limit and the current bandwidth usage. A system prototype was implemented and evaluated in the Future Internet Testbed with Security (FITS). The results show that the proposal avoids users' starvation of network resources without adding much overhead in the network.","","","10.1109/GIIS.2015.7347185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347185","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Computer crime;IP networks;Monitoring;Servers;Software","Internet;computer network security;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic","DoS attacks;FITS;FlowFence architecture;Future Internet Testbed with Security;SDN controller;attack detection;congestion conditions;coordinate bandwidth assignment;denial of service defense system;denial of service mitigation system;flow transmission rate;routers;software defined networking;starvation state mitigation procedure;traffic pattern;user network resource starvation","","2","","19","","","28-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper aims at utilizing potential benefits from applying distributed multiagent technology to network security. To facilitate information exchange between different agents in our proposed hybrid layered multiagent architecture, a low-cost and low response time agent communication protocol is developed to tackle the issues typically associated with a distributed multiagent system, such as poor system performance, excessive processing power requirement, and long delays. The bandwidth and response time performance of the proposed end-to-end system is investigated through the simulation of the proposed agent communication protocol on our private LAN testbed called Hierarchical Agent Network for Intrusion Detection Systems (HAN-IDS). The simulation results show that our proposed system is efficient and extensible since it consumes negligible bandwidth with low cost and low response time.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/AINA.2009.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076193","Agent Architecture;Agent Communication;IDS;KQML","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Costs;Delay;Information security;Intrusion detection;Multiagent systems;Power system security;Protocols;Technology management","local area networks;multi-agent systems;protocols;security of data","communication protocol;hybrid layered multiagent architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network security","","2","","20","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","8","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is light-weight in the sense that the intrusion detection system (IDS) used for estimating the trust that one node has for another, consumes limited computational resource. Moreover, it uses only local information thereby ensuring scalability. Our light-weight IDS takes care of two kinds of attacks, namely, the blackhole attack and the grey hole attack.

As a result, while large and resourceful organizations can afford the high cost of this technology, smaller security firms and security researchers are fundamentally constrained. We propose and build a shared infrastructure for deploying and monitoring honeypots, called HoneyLab, that is similar in spirit to PlanetLab. With an overlay and distributed structure of address space and computing resources, HoneyLab increases coverage and accelerates innovation among security researchers as well as security industry experts relying on honeypot-based attack detection technology.

Our goal is to retrofit autonomic computing onto such systems, externally, without any need to understand or modify the code, and in many cases even when it is impossible to recompile. We present a meta-architecture implemented as active middleware infrastructure to explicitly add autonomic services via an attached feedback loop that provides continual monitoring and, as needed, reconfiguration and/or repair.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

This limits the chances of eavesdropping and traffic analyzing to a time-critical on-demand window. Anonymity is one of the important characteristics in securing a wireless ad hoc network routing. In this paper we study the unique anonymity threats in wireless ad hoc environments. Two design principles of anonymous routing - anonymous route discovery and anonymous data forwarding are presented here. In the anonymous route discovery design, a random route pseudonym for an on demand route is established. In the anonymous data forwarding design, the source wraps its data packets for each end to end connection. This was implemented and tested using NS-2.0 simulator.

This causes the cluster or the whole network to be controlled by the malicious nodes. To offer high level of security, the mobile sensor nodes need to be authenticated. Further, clustering of nodes improves scalability, energy efficient routing and data delivery. In this paper, we propose a cluster based secure dynamic keying technique to authenticate the nodes during mobility. The nodes with high configuration are chosen as cluster heads based on the weight value which is estimated using parameters such as the node degree, average distance, node's average speed, and virtual battery power. The keys are dynamically generated and used for providing security. Even the keys are compromised by the attackers, they are not able to use the previous keys to cheat or disuse the authenticated nodes. In addition, a bidirectional malicious node detection technique is employed which eliminates the malicious node from the network.

TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity.

In this paper, we explore the practical needs for monitoring and intrusion detection through a thorough analysis of the different threats targeting an AMI.","","","10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5622068","","Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;security of data;smart power grids","IT security;advanced metering infrastructure security;architectural directions;complete monitoring solution;intrusion detection;secure protocols;security properties","","57","1","36","","","4-6 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It identifies the challenges in deploying Wireless Mesh networks (WMNs) and focus on secure routing as one of the key challenges in deploying WMNs. In order to implement a secure routing system, various Artificial Immune System (AIS) models were analysed. These models have been used in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and computer security in the literature. In this paper, the authors propose to use Danger models to secure routing in WMNs. The first step in secure routing process is to identify and classify the network dangers and take necessary actions to overcome those dangers. For the classification task, we apply Self-organizing Maps (SOMs) as the classifier to classify the danger levels in WMNs. These identified danger conditions are further deployed as the warning signals for the design of secure routing protocol.

The second step is to model defense behavior of defenders utilizing intrusion detection and tolerance strategies to reactively and proactively counter dynamic adversary behavior. We leverage game theory to model attack/defense dynamics with the players being the attackers/defenders, the actions being the attack/defense strategies identified, and the payoff for each outcome being related to system survivability.

It would, as such, make sense to exploit the capabilities of these higher order devices to perform network monitoring tasks.

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic.

Several mechanisms to counter these attacks were proposed but none of them is able to anticipate the behavior of nodes. In the present work, we target this problem by proposing a preventive mechanism able to predict the behavior of vehicles and prevent from attacks. We use Kalman filter to predict the future behavior of vehicles and classify them into three categories (white, gray and black) based on their expected trustworthiness. The main concern of this work is to prevent from the denial of service (DoS) attack.

After only a few years, an organization's Internet infrastructure is likely to need a major overhaul. In late 2001, the systems architecture team to which I belong took on these issues for an organization that wanted to rebuild its Web infrastructure. The existing infrastructure contained multiple single points of failure, could not scale to expected usage patterns, was built on proprietary systems, and had a high management overhead. The legacy infrastructure had grown organically over the previous five years as administrators added unplanned features and functionality, and usage had grown 100-fold since the specifications were initially developed. Because of the age and condition of the legacy systems, we decided to redesign the solution from scratch to overcome the inherent limitations.

In this paper, we present a survey on darknet. The latter is an effective approach to observe Internet activities and cyber attacks via passive monitoring. We primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities.

The 12th IEEE International Conference on","","2003","2","","1231","1236 vol.2","The complexity, openness, and increasing accessibility of the Internet have all greatly increased the risk of information system security availability. A serious type of network attacks is Denial of Service (DoS), which is performed against an information system to prevent legitimate users from accessing the compromised system for service. This paper concerns detecting DoS attacks using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The key idea is to train SVMs using already discovered patterns (signatures) that represent DoS attacks. Using a benchmark data from a KDD competition designed by DARPA (U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), we demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate classifiers can be constructed by using SVMs to detect DoS attacks. Further, we also perform feature ranking of the DARPA intrusion data to identify the key features that are important to DoS detection.","","","10.1109/FUZZ.2003.1206607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206607","","Computer crime;Computer science;Detectors;Humans;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","Internet;security of data;support vector machines","DARPA defense advanced research projects agency;Internet accessibility;Internet complexity;Internet openness;SVM support vector machines;denial of service attacks detection;information system security;intrusion data;legitimate users","","17","","36","","","25-28 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX.

Dynamic composition of such ""network services"" allows networks to establish connections with customized communication characteristics to satisfy various application requirements. In these networks, there are two problems that need to be solved: finding the optimal composition of services to satisfy the communication requirements of a given connection (""service composition"") and finding the optimal path for a given composition of services such that the required services are executed in sequence along the path (""service routing""). So far, these two problems have been studied separately. In our work, we combine both into a ""service composition and routing"" approach that can achieve better solutions than the current, separate approach. We present a novel decision making system that can determine the optimal or near-optimal solutions for the service composition and routing problem. We develop a synthetic benchmark for service requests to help comprehensively evaluate the performance of our systems.

One of the major challenge in Web applications is that it need to process massive files and data-sets to respond to an increasing number of users requests. These data may range from multimedia data to sensor data. Along with the size of data, user satisfaction is an important constraint imposing Quality of Service requirements. Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster. The proposed policy was developed and tested on a load balancing framework called CLOUDIZER, and the performance of the strategy was compared over the traditional algorithms.","","","10.1109/IConSCS.2012.6502459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502459","Bloom Filter;Caching;Load balancing","","Web services;cache storage;cloud computing;data structures;quality of service;resource allocation","CLOUDIZER;WACA policy;Web clusters;Web services;bloom filter based cache summary;centralized load balancing algorithm;cloud computing;data-sets;information retrieval time;load balancing framework;load distribution strategy;multimedia data;quality of service requirements;sensor data;traditional algorithms;user satisfaction;workload and cache aware load balancing policy","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper introduces a tool called SecAMI that calculates the relationship between the speed at which an attack spreads, the speed at which it can be detected, and the consequences on the availability of the AMI. The results from SecAMI can be used as a performance metric to significantly improve the development and the deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in an AMI environment.

More is needed than simply enabling IPv6 on local area network (LAN) routers and switches. Many infrastructure components must be upgraded as well, including Domain Name Service (DNS), directory services, security, and network management. Besides the physical hardware and software components, local policies need to be defined for network security and IPv6 addressing, and steps need to be taken to provide training for administrators and registration of IPv6 pilots.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably “Attack multipliers” and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naïve fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","5","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"RAPiD: An indirect rogue access points detection system","G. Qu; M. N. Michael","Computer Science and Engineering Department, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, USA","International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","","2010","","","9","16","Rogue wireless access points (RWAPs) bypass physical endpoint security of local area networks and present significant security threats by creating network attack vectors behind firewalls, exposing confidential information, and allowing unauthorized utilization of network resources. A family of more promising methods detects RWAPs indirectly by identifying unauthorized wireless hosts through using temporal TCP/IP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT). Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n.

This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which uses Enhanced C4.5 which rely on labeled training data and an Enhanced Fast Heuristic Clustering Algorithm for mixed data (EFHCAM). The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously ""unseen"" attacks.

Design of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such networks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven and resource constrained. This paper presents a robust and efficient key exchange protocol for nodes authentication in a MANET based on multi-path communication.

One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175","","Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework","","9","","14","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, in addition to producing alerts, it should allow for easy insertion of new detection algorithms. It should also support dynamic selection and de-selection of detection algorithms, and it should adjust its resource consumption to the current need. Such a system would allow the operator to easily extend the system when new detection algorithms become available. It would also allow the operator to maintain a low-cost monitoring baseline and perform more extensive monitoring when it is required. In this paper we propose an architecture for intrusion detection which aims at providing the operator with this support. The architecture uses a modular design to promote a high degree of flexibility. This supports creation of an environment in which state-of-the-art intrusion detection algorithms easily can be inserted. The modular design also allows for detection algorithms to be enabled and disabled when required. Additionally, the architecture uses a sensor reconfiguration mechanism to affect the amount of data collected. When a detection algorithm is enabled or disabled, the sensor providing the input data to the algorithm is correspondingly reconfigured. This implies a minimum of excess collected data. To illustrate the feasibility of the architecture, we provide a proof - of-concept supporting monitoring of users for insider detection and webserver monitoring for intrusion attempts.","","","10.1109/IAS.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627079","adaption;intrusion detection;operator-centric;sensor reconfiguration;system architecture","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system security;Computer science;Computer security;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Quality of service;Sensor systems","security of data","adaptive intrusion detection;insider detection;low-cost monitoring baseline;modular design;operator-centric intrusion detection;sensor reconfiguration mechanism;webserver monitoring","","1","","22","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are populating video platforms and are shared through different online social services, giving rise to the so-called mobile social media applications. These applications are characterized by communication sessions that frequently and dynamically update content, shared with a potential number of mobile users, sharing the same location or being dispersed over a wide geographical area. Since most of UGC content of mobile social media applications are exchanged through mobile devices, it is expected that along with online social applications, these content will cause severe congestion to mobile networks, impacting both their core and radio access networks. In this paper, we address the challenges introduced by these applications devising a complete framework that 1) identifies such applications/sessions and 2) initiates multicast-based delivery (or offload through WiFi) of the relevant content. The proposed framework leverages the network function virtualization (NFV) paradigm to dynamically integrate its functionalities to the operators' service function chaining (SFC) process, allowing fast deployment and lowering both capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX) of the mobile operators. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated through mathematical analysis and computer simulations, taking Twitter-like social applications as an example.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2512274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365473","EPS;Evolved Packet System;Social media networking;and mobile network;evolved packet system;mobile network;network function virtualization;service chaining","Media;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Streaming media;Twitter;Wireless communication","Internet;mobile radio;multimedia communication;social networking (online);virtualisation;wireless LAN","CAPEX reduction;NFV paradigm;OPEX reduction;UGC-based applications;Wi-Fi;capital expenditure reduction;computer simulation;core network;dynamic service function chaining;mathematical analysis;mobile Internet user;mobile network congestion;mobile social media applications;multicast-based delivery;network function virtualization paradigm;online social services;operational expenditure reduction;radio access network;user generated content-based applications;video platform;video sharing","","","","34","","20151224","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such an energy-efficient routing protocol has been proposed to prolong the network lifetime and motivate selfish nodes to cooperate during the selection of Cluster Heads (CHs) and MultiPoint Relay nodes (MPR). Unfortunately, this protocol is still vulnerable to the presence of malicious nodes. To detect malicious activities, taking into consideration network lifetime, we randomly select a set of nodes that will play the role of intrusion detection monitors. The selected nodes will monitor the behavior of regular nodes, MPRs, and CHs looking for abnormal activities such as the disruption of cluster head election. Our simulation results show that with 50% of monitors we can detect malicious activities with probability more than 70%. According to severity of attacks, intrusion detection nodes can be gradually added and thus our solution is able to consider the tradeoff between security and network lifetime.","2160-4886;21604886","","10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6085413","Ad hoc networks;IDS;OLSR;malicious behavior;node clustering","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Nominations and elections;Protocols;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;probability;relays;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CH selection;MPR node;SC-OLSR protocol;cluster head selection;cluster-based OLSR protocol;detection mechanism;energy-efficient routing protocol;intrusion detection monitoring;malicious attack detection;multipoint relay node;optimized link state routing protocol","","1","","18","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to an attack called <i>misrouting</i> <i>attack</i>. Packet misrouting disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. I provide a protocol called MlMl based on local monitoring to remedy the attack. It requires the neighbors to maintain additional information about the routing path. I show through performance analysis that the basic local monitoring fails to mitigate the misrouting attack while MlMl successfully does.","1930-529X;1930529X","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4697929","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Relays;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;radio networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","local monitoring;misrouting attack;multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks;neighborhood communication;packet misrouting;security attacks","","2","","17","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"TCAM-Based Multi-Match Packet Classification Using Multidimensional Rule Layering","D. Y. Chang; P. C. Wang","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, ROC","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2016","24","2","1125","1138","Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) has superior performance for single-match packet classification but not the case for multi-match packet classification. The limitation is caused by TCAM architecture that reports only the first matching rule. To cope with the limitation, previous algorithms use extra TCAM entries or accesses, or both, to fulfill multi-match packet classification. These algorithms also reorder rules; thus, a multi-match classifier based on these algorithms cannot maintain performance for single-match packet classification. In other words, all matching rules must be yielded to determine the highest priority matching rule. In this paper, we present a TCAM-based scheme for multi-match packet classification without single-match penalty. Our scheme partitions a rule set based on range layering, which can be applied to achieve range encoding. The rule partitioning generates rule subsets which satisfy that the rules in a subset are mutually disjoint. Each rule is then tagged a bitmap for subset identification to fulfill multi-match packet classification. Two approaches, loose coupling and tight coupling, are derived with different search procedures while incorporating range encoding. Both approaches can maintain original rule order, but with different performance tradeoff. We also present a refinement which uses all available TCAM entries to improve the performance of multi-match packet classification. The experimental results show that combining range encoding with multi-match packet classification has advantages of storage efficiency and speed superiority. The capability of supporting single-match packet classification also provides better flexibility of applying different packet actions.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2411274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070777","Geometric intersection;multi-match;packet classification;range encoding;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory","Internet;content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication network routing","Internet routers;TCAM architecture;multidimensional rule layering;multimatch classifier;multimatch packet classification;priority matching rule;range encoding;range layering;reorder rules;rule partitioning;single-match packet classification;subset identification;ternary content addressable memory","","1","","47","","20150327","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These problems are emphasized when dealing with complex or parallel programs. This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs. We use Petri Nets to benefit from a formal description able to compactly describe parallel behaviors. Obtained models can then be enhanced with extra requirements such as resources usage limits or temporal execution bounds by means of observers.

Asset identification helps organizations to identify and to respond quickly to any security breaches. In this paper, machine learning based techniques are used to identify assets based on their connectivity, i.e., servers and endpoints. For the analysis presented in this paper four different machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest algorithms are used and the performance of these algorithms is assessed in terms of the F-score calculated for each algorithm. Results show that for a given dataset, amongst all four algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved highest accuracy in terms of identifying the assets correctly. However, the Random Forest algorithm is computationally intensive and may not work for large datasets. Naive Bayes algorithm yielded the worst performance and KNearest Neighbor's performance was very close to that achieved by Support Vector Machines.

The system ensures high service availability for the network members through a number of schemes. A novel behavior grading mechanism provides security criteria for the network nodes and aids the management functions of the KMS to revoke or reissue certificates for nodes. This mechanism is based on the notion of trust, and more specifically on SAs among nodes in the entire network.

Scattering multiple copies of the packets in order to reach the sink, leads to more network and energy inefficiency. Moreover, collusion of malicious nodes is addressed vaguely by literature. In this paper, we propose a secure routing methodology which semi-randomly propagates a packet in the shortest path to the Sink by circumventing the malicious nodes.

Sensor nodes placed in remote areas require less attention and supervision, but require significant battery power to survive long periods of time. Recharging or replacing batteries are difficult since units are often placed in areas which are difficult to access. Hence this technology requires sensor nodes to be as autonomic as possible where the nodes should be able to manage themselves without human intervention. We proposed a new mobile agent based energy efficient, self-healing framework for a sensor network. The proposed framework will be implemented in a real world prototype specifically providing detection of illegal entry to designated areas.

When network function virtualization (NFV) is enabled, virtualized NFs (vNF) can be placed when and where needed. In this study, we identify the possibility of minimizing the expensive optical/electronic/optical (O/E/O) conversions for NFV chaining in packet/optical datacenters, which is introduced by the on-demand placement of vNFs. When the vNFs of the same NF chain are properly grouped into fewer pods, traffic flows can avoid unnecessary traversals in the optical domain. We formulate the problem of optimal vNF placement in binary integer programming (BIP), and propose an alternative efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this problem. Evaluation results show that our algorithm can achieve near-optimal O/E/O conversions comparable to BIP. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under various scenarios, with comparison to a simple first-fit algorithm.","0733-8724;07338724","","10.1109/JLT.2015.2388585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005460","Datacenter;datacenter;network function placement;network function virtualization;optical;service chaining","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Middleboxes;Noise measurement;Optical fiber networks;Optical packet switching;Optical switches","computer centres;integer programming;optical fibre networks;optical wavelength conversion;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","BIP;NFV;NFV chaining;binary integer programming;expensive optical-electronic-optical conversions;heuristic algorithm;near-optimal O/E/O conversions;network function placement;network function virtualization;packet-based fine-grained traffic steering schemes;packet-optical data centers;traffic flows;vNF","","7","","14","","20150109","April15, 15 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then, we assess the impact of putting operational but possibly infected nodes into quarantine. Finally, we study the implications of scanning nodes for early detection of malware (e.g., worms), accounting for false positives and false negatives.

In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed.

In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study. Analytical results compare with NS2 simulation results that prove the validity of analytical models. This empirical study illustrates the importance of designing smarter internal attacker detection mechanism to protect multicast routing protocols from the above-mentioned intelligent internal attacks.","2377-6927;23776927","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229740","Byzantine attacks;IDS;MANET;MAODV;attacker prevention technique;internal attacks;multicast","Analytical models;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","access protocols;bandwidth allocation;computer network security;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","Byzantine attack;MAC layer;MANET;MAODV;bandwidth utilization;collision avoidance mechanism;denial of service attack;information delivery;intelligent internal attack;intelligent stealthy attack;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;multicast communication;multicast routing protocol;multicast tree;next generation data transmission mechanism;smarter internal attacker detection mechanism design","","1","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network performance is sometimes reduced to unacceptable levels due to events such as congestion, equipment failure and information-warfare attacks. A popular solution to these problems is to increase available bandwidth within local area networks and across the wide area network. For the DoD, this option is often unavailable, especially for in-theater forces. It has been demonstrated that quality of service (QoS) policies, created with currently available commercial products, can improve the performance of IP-based networks by orders of magnitude. However, different QoS policies are needed to address specific scenarios such as a particular operational mission, a denial-of-service attack or bandwidth saturation. The network administrator must implement the appropriate QoS policy on an as-needed basis. This paper describes a prototype QoS event manager that automates the process of QoS policy implementation. Based on inputs from network monitoring devices, routers and humans, the QoS event manager selects an appropriate QoS policy and deploys it across the network. We discuss the QoS event manager design and consider issues regarding automated prioritization, tracking and deconfliction of QoS policies.","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985960","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Equipment failure;Local area networks;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Prototypes;Quality management;Quality of service;Wide area networks","computer network management;local area networks;military communication;military computing;quality of service;wide area networks","DoD;IP network;QoS event manager;QoS policies;automated prioritization;automated tracking;bandwidth saturation;congestion;denial-of-service attack;equipment failure;in-theater forces;information-warfare attacks;local area networks;network administrator;network monitoring devices;network performance;quality of service;routers;wide area network","","0","","","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097;15219097","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","1","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets.

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","","","10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973690","Anomaly Detection;Clustering;Discrepancy Metric;Information Entropy;k-menas","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information entropy;Measurement;Testing;Training","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DR value;FAR value;IE&FSDM algorithm;KDD CUP1999 dataset;anomaly detection;clustering analysis;frequency sensitive discrepancy metric;information entropy;intrusion detection technology;k-means clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","7-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An integrated testbed for advanced wireless networked control systems technology","J. H. Taylor; J. Slipp","Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, N. B., Canada, E3B 5A3","IECON 2010 - 36th Annual Conference on IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","","2010","","","2101","2106","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained widespread acceptance during the last decade, largely due to the greatly increased flexibility, lower costs and scalability that they have been shown to provide. The pace of application in the context of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) has been somewhat impeded, however, by the reluctance of industry to accept the risks of allowing wireless paths to be incorporated in process control loops. The problem is that there are conflicts between maintaining control loop performance, which can be degraded by many factors, such as low data rates, delays in wireless paths, jitter and electromagnetic interference; and the usual objectives in managing a wireless sensor network, namely freedom to configure the network and to adjust data rates at will, to maximize efficiency and to conserve energy consumption in battery-powered network nodes. In the context of developing advanced controls technology for systems with wireless networks in feedback paths there is a strong need for a test environment that can be used to explore all facets of such systems, including potential problems relating to control loop performance and WSN management. We propose to address this requirement by developing a new testbed for research in WNCSs by adding advanced control agents and process simulators from the Intelligent Control and Asset Management or ICAM project to an existing WSN testbed called the Wireless Industrial Sensor Network Testbed for Radio-Harsh Environments or WINTeR. This testbed has been custom developed for oil and gas industrial environments, i.e., it includes features such as electromagnetic interference and complex multipath propagation. The proposed new testbed, hereafter called WINTeR-ICAM, will include the ICAM Supervisor, ICAM Agents and an additional agent to resolve conflicts between maintaining control loop performance and managing the WSN effectively and efficiently, called a WNCS Coordination Agent or WNCSCA. This age- - nt is designed to be part of an intelligent supervisory control system, and to grant the WSN as much latitude in meeting its objectives as possible while maintaining the performance of control loops that incorporate wireless paths, thus adding to the safety and reliability of future WNCSs. Together, the process simulators, ICAM Agents and WINTeR will provide a powerful new environment for research and development of advanced WNCS technology, with WSN hardware and software in the loop; this novel conception is the contribution of this paper.","1553-572X;1553572X","","10.1109/IECON.2010.5675268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675268","","Actuators;Communication system security;Data models;Delay;Process control;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","networked control systems;telecommunication control;wireless sensor networks","WNCS coordination agent;advanced wireless networked control systems;battery-powered network nodes;data rate factor;electromagnetic interference factor;jitter factor;radio-harsh environments;wireless industrial sensor network testbed;wireless paths delay factor;wireless sensor networks","","2","","25","","","7-10 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These two concerns, however, are often handled separately. In this paper we present a threat driven approach that improves on the quality of software through the realization of a more secure functional model. The approach introduces systematic transformation rules and integration steps for mapping attack tree representations into lower level dynamic behavior, then integrates this behavior into state chart-based functional models. Through the focus on both the functional and threat behavior, software engineers can introduce, clearly define and understand security concerns as software is designed.

However, there are some challenges for implementing a full-scale carrier SDN. One of the most important challenges is SDN security, which is beginning to receive attention. With new SDN architecture, some security threats are common to traditional networking, but the profile of these threats (including their likelihood and impact and hence their overall risk level) changes. Moreover, there are some new security challenges such as bypassing predefined mandatory policies by overwriting flow entries and data eavesdropping by inserting fraudulent flow entries. This paper is to design open-flow specific security solutions and propose a comprehensive security architecture to provide security services such as enforcing mandatory network policy correctly and receiving network policy securely for SDN in order to solve these common security issues and new security challenges.

Relatively, little attention has been paid for employing a second line of defense that can detect intrusive behavior after successfully penetrating the first one.

The controllers provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but still low-level, limited and inflexible. Highlevel languages have the potential to be a better alternative to program the network. There exist several SDN programming languages implementing different sets of functionalities, and focusing on solving various issues. In face of all this diversity, no published paper outlines a pragmatic view allowing to compare the SDN languages. This paper presents a systematic survey of up-to-date OpenFlow-based SDN programming languages. Our approach relies on a taxonomy comprising all prominent features found in those languages.

"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Sui Song; C. N. Manikopoulos","","2006 IEEE Information Assurance Workshop","","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","1","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of these mechanisms in a network security scenario consisting of network monitoring elements, attack detection, and firewall devices. Previous work identified most existing detection approaches as not suitable for high-speed networks. This problem can be alleviated by separating the methodologies for network monitoring and for subsequent data analysis.

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","2","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, different from general-purpose ICT systems, enforcement mechanisms are generally very basic in INS. As a consequence, verifying the correctness of policy implementation becomes a crucial task, especially cumbersome when it needs to be carried out entirely by hand. This paper presents a new methodology, which also serves as the basis of a purposely developed software tool conceived to cope with the lack of policy enforcement mechanisms in INS and to allow semiautomatic verification of policy implementation. Our approach is based on a twofold system model that enables both the abstract specification of access control policies and the detailed description of the target physical system.

The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms.

Finally S-DSDV reduces the overhead, end to end delay and increases network life time by sending and receiving more number of packet across the network and provides the better throughput when compare to DSDV routing protocol.","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019587","DSDV;S-DSDV;Spatial-DSDV;manet;routing","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","MANET;S-DSDV routing algorithm;end to end delay reduction;mobile ad hoc network throughput;overhead reduction;spatial DSDV routing algorithm;spatial destination sequenced distance vector routing protocol","","1","","16","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ansari","DRIVE Laboratory, University of Burgundy, 58000, Nevers, France.","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2016","PP","99","1","11","Advances in wireless communications and microelectronics have spearheaded the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used to augment a ground network composed of sensors and/or vehicles in order to increase coverage, enhance the end-to-end delay, and improve data processing. While UAV-aided networks can potentially find applications in many areas, a number of issues, particularly security, have not been readily addressed. The intrusion detection system is the most commonly used technique to detect attackers. In this paper, we focus on addressing two main issues within the context of intrusion detection and attacker ejection in UAV-aided networks, namely, activation of the intrusion monitoring process and attacker ejection. In fact, when a large number of nodes activate their monitoring processes, the incurred overhead can be substantial and, as a consequence, degrades the network performance. Therefore, a tradeoff between the intrusion detection rate and overhead is considered in this work. It is not always the best strategy to eject a node immediately when it exhibits a bad sign of malicious activities since this sign could be provisional (the node may switch to a normal behavior in the future) or be simply due to noise or unreliable communications. Thus, a dilemma between detection and false positive rates is taken into account in this paper. We propose to address these two security issues by a Bayesian game model in order to accurately detect attacks (i.e., high detection and low false positive rates) with a low overhead. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed security game framework does achieve reliable detection.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2600370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7549080","Bayesian game;intrusion detection system (IDS);intrusion ejection system (IES);unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);vehicular networks","Bayes methods;Games;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Unmanned aerial vehicles","","","","","","","","20160824","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"A quantitative approach towards detection of an optimal attack path in a wireless network using modified PSO technique","N. Ghosh; S. Nanda; S. K. Ghosh","School of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur- 721302, India","2009 First International Communication Systems and Networks and Workshops","","2009","","","1","10","In recent years there has been an immense proliferation of wireless networks and they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Thus there is a serious need to secure such networks from attacks. Usually an attacker can penetrate into a network by utilizing a chain of exploits. An exploit is a small piece of code that makes use of vulnerabilities present in a service or in a system. Each exploit in the chain has a set of preconditions and effects and lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploits. Application of such a chain of exploits generates a set of attack states or network states which form a path called the attack path and combining many such attack paths produces an attack graph. A lot of research has been done on issues such as scalable and time efficient ways of generation of attack graphs in wired network in contrast to that in wireless scenario. Moreover, the need is to identify the path that may be chosen by the attacker to comprise a target system in less time and effort. The proposed methodology in this paper aims as finding out the optimal or risk-prone attack path that the attacker may choose to penetrate a wireless network. The generation of attack paths in a wireless network is itself a difficult proposition due to networks inherent dynamic nature and ever changing topology. In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been employed for finding out the optimal attack path using an attack vector metric. The effort required on the part of the attacker to compromise a target system has been termed as an attack vector. The wireless nodes have been assigned severity measures obtained from customized risk parameters which serve as an input to the modified PSO technique. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.","2155-2487;21552487","","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808869","","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;IP networks;Information technology;National security;Network topology;Particle swarm optimization;Wide area networks;Wireless networks","particle swarm optimisation;radio networks;telecommunication security","attack graph;attack vector metric;chain-of-exploits;modified PSO;network security;optimal attack path;particle swarm optimization;wireless network","","1","","35","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major tools for protecting the network attacking is the intrusion detection system (IDS), which make the system being the first target that will be attacked by the intruder. As we cannot avoid them, the problem is when there is an attack, how does the intrusion detection system survived. In this research, we show the restriction of the present intrusion detection system architecture and propose the new architecture that can handle the attack via the network and survive from it, using the mobile agent technology with the network topology design that hides the main resource of the network behind the intrusion detection system which separates network resource into segments and installs the monitored host onto each of network segment for robustness from all pattern of the attacking.

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","3","","32","","20130207","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","23","","20150813","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The results indicate that the mechanism is effective in maintaining roughly 50% to 80% service levels even when hit by an overwhelming attack.","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2015.7335317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335317","","Cloud computing;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Control systems;IP networks;Servers","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","SDN-enabled networks;attack types;attacker adaptation;defender constraints;defense mechanism;distributed denial-of-service attack mitigation;elastic capacity invocation;external blacklist information;filtering;flooding DDoS mitigation;load control;normal traffic learning;overwhelming attack;performance analysis;physical SDN testbed;real-life normal traffic traces;service elasticity;service levels;software defined networking;synthetic attack traces;traffic management","","","","14","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ACM/IEEE Symposium on","","2006","","","183","192","As intrusion detection systems (IDS) utilize more complex syntax to efficiently describe complex attacks, their processing requirements increase rapidly. Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","","10.1145/1185347.1185372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Engines;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Software","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","15","1","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection. We apply the approach to a reliable multicast protocol (TRAM) and demonstrate its performance by comparing it with our previous framework.","1060-9857;10609857","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365703","","Application software;Computer errors;Costs;Distributed computing;Electric breakdown;Fault detection;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Sampling methods;Throughput","computer network reliability;electronic messaging;error detection;fault tolerant computing;multicast protocols;sampling methods;telecommunication security","anomaly-based rule;fault tolerance system;high throughput distributed system;message exchange;reliable multicast protocol;sampling approach;stateful error detection","","3","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to GPU's tremendous computing capability, it has emerged as the co-processor of CPU to achieve a high overall throughput. CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost. It also shows good scalability when varying the number of dimensions of the reference dataset, the number of objects in the reference dataset, and the number of objects in the query dataset.","2158-6985;21586985","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607480","","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches;Programming","C language;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;optimisation;pattern classification","C language;CUDA optimization techniques;CUDA-enabled GPU;KNN;classification technique;coprocessor;graphics processing units;parallel implementation;parallel k-nearest neighbor algorithm;query dataset;text classification","","6","1","18","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns-2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load.","1530-0889;15300889","","10.1109/DSN.2007.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273007","Sensor networks;local monitoring;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna.","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Delay;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","sensor networks;sleep-wake aware local monitoring;telecommunication traffic","","7","","30","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios.

Specifically, we describe a multi-level approach for assuring resilience in critical infrastructures and services, taking into account organisational, technological and individuals' (OTI) viewpoints. The framework supports detection of anomalies by using appropriate techniques at the different levels of infrastructure and service.

Most anomaly detection approaches using MLP can detect novel real-time attacks, but still has high false alarm rates. Most attacks are composed of a series of anomaly events. These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron. This approach also exhibits a lower false alarm rate when detects novel attacks. The simulation tests are conducted using DARPA 1998 dataset. The experimental results are presented and compared in ROC curves, which can demonstrate that the proposed approach performs exceptionally in terms of both detection rate and false alarm rate","2164-7143;21647143","","10.1109/ISDA.2006.253765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021817","","Cellular neural networks;Chaos;Collaborative work;Educational programs;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Leak detection;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Real time systems","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;chaotic neural network;false alarm;hybrid MLP-CNN;intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron;time-delayed attacks","","4","","22","","","16-18 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since extracting discriminative features for any machine learning task is a fundamental step, we explain the process of extracting discriminative features for the detection of brute force attacks. We incorporate domain knowledge about SSH brute force attacks as well as the analysis of a representative collection of the data to define the features. We collected real SSH traffic from a campus network. We also generated some failed login data that a legitimate user who has forgotten his/her password can produce as normal traffic that can be similar to the SSH brute force attack traffic. Our inspection on the collected brute force Netflow data and the manually produced SSH failed login data showed that the Netflow features are not discriminative enough to discern brute force traffic from the failed login traffic produced by a legitimate user. We introduced an aggregation of Netflows to extract the proper features for building machine learning models.

"A methodology for P2P file-sharing traffic detection","A. Spognardi; A. Lucarelli; R. Di Pietro","Dipt. di Informatica, Universita di Roma "La Sapienza", Italy","Second International Workshop on Hot Topics in Peer-to-Peer Systems","","2005","","","52","61","Since the widespread adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking during the late '90s, P2P applications have multiplied. Their diffusion and adoption are witnessed by the fact that P2P traffic accounts for a significant fraction of Internet traffic. Further, there are concerns regarding the use of these applications, for instance when they are employed to share copyright protected material. Hence, in many situations there would be many reasons to detect P2P traffic. In the late '90s, P2P traffic was easily recognizable since P2P protocols used application-specific TCP or UDP port numbers. However, P2P applications were quickly empowered with the ability to use arbitrary ports in an attempt to go undetected. Nowadays, P2P applications explicitly try to camouflage the originated traffic in an attempt to go undetected. Despite the presence of rules to detect P2P traffic, no methodology exists to extract them from applications without the use of reverse engineering. In this paper we develop a methodology to detect P2P traffic. It is based on the analysis of the protocol used by a P2P application, extraction of specific patterns unique to the protocol, coding of such a pattern in rules to be fed to an intrusion detection system (IDS), and validation of the pattern via network traffic monitoring with SNORT (an open source IDS) fed with the devised rules. In particular, we present a characterization of P2P traffic originated by the OpenNap and WPN protocols (implemented in the WinMx application) and FastTrack protocol (used by KaZaA) obtained using our methodology, that shows the viability of our proposal. Finally, we conclude the paper exposing our undergoing efforts in the extension of the methodology to exploit differences between centralized and decentralized P2P protocols, as well as the characterization of encrypted traffic, and highlight a new research direction in the identification of P2P traffic.","","","10.1109/HOT-P2P.2005.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517791","","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Protection;Protocols;Reverse engineering;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;copyright;pattern recognition;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FastTrack protocol;Internet traffic;KaZaA;OpenNap protocol;P2P application;P2P file-sharing traffic detection;P2P protocols;P2P traffic;SNORT;TCP;UDP;WPN protocol;copyright protected material;encrypted traffic characterization;intrusion detection system;network traffic monitoring;pattern extraction;peer-to-peer networking;reverse engineering","","13","3","23","","","21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303;07421303","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","1","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we try to build an IDS based on a co-operative scheme to detect intrusions in a mobile ad hoc network using basic game theory concepts. To identify the intrusion we deal with two layers - the application layer with underlying grid architecture and the network layer.

Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator.

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission. NTRU is Lattice-based cryptography, which is known to be resistant to quantum attacks. We assume a clustered MANET environment i.e. the mobile nodes have an efficient cluster-based routing algorithm deployed which gives us the list of clusters available in the environment along with its cluster heads and competent routing between them.

IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. In this paper, we study the different existing IDS architectures for MANETs. We briefly present for each architecture, after an analysis, the strengths and weaknesses, the methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performances and the provided security services. Then, we propose a new IDS architecture for MANETs, this architecture is a combination model hierarchical based on clusters and cooperation model based on a multi-agent system (SMA).

One major reason why traffic trace owners hesitate to make the traces publicly available is the concern that confidential and private information may be inferred from the trace. We focus on the problem of anonymizing IP addresses in a trace. More specifically, we are interested in prefix-preserving anonymization in which the prefix relationship among IP addresses is preserved in the anonymized trace, making such a trace usable in situations where prefix relationships are important. The goal of our work is two fold. First, we develop a cryptography-based, prefix-preserving anonymization technique that is provably as secure as the existing well-known TCPdpriv scheme, and unlike TCPdpriv, provides consistent prefix-preservation in large scale distributed setting. Second, we evaluate the security properties inherent in all prefix-preserving IP address anonymization schemes (including TCPdpriv). Through the analysis of Internet backbone traffic traces, we investigate the effect of some types of attacks on the security of any prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm. We also derive results for the optimum manner in which an attack should proceed, which provides a bound on the effectiveness of attacks in general.","1092-1648;10921648","","10.1109/ICNP.2002.1181415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181415","","Binary trees;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Decision making;Stress","Internet;cryptography;optimisation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP addresses;Internet backbone traffic traces;Internet research;TCPdpriv scheme;confidential information;cryptography;measurement-based security evaluation;optimisation;prefix-preserving IP address anonymity;prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm;private information;real-world traffic traces;security attacks;security properties","","15","","21","","","12-15 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level.

We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets.

In this paper, a mobile backbone network of trusted nodes is proposed to enhance AODV security with minimum overhead. The proposed backbone network does not violate the MANET mobility characteristic. It is constructed from randomly moving regular MANET nodes based on their trust value, location, and power. The backbone network monitors regular nodes as well as each other to periodically estimate monitoring trust values which represent the reliability of each node in the network.

In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI.

In this paper, an efficient botnet detection system is proposed for detecting the P2P botnet. The proposed botnet detection system estimates the flow export using NetFlow protocol. The packet flow is analyzed using three main components namely, Exporter, Collector, and Analyzer. The exporter captures the packet and monitors the contents of the packet. The collector captures the flow traffic and the analyzer component initiates an automated analysis of traffic with the captured packet information. The packet flow information is collected by virtual interface and physical probe. The virtual interface is used for collecting the malicious traffic information between the Virtual Machines (VMs) and the physical probe gathers malicious traffic information between the network bridges connecting VMs. The information collected from these techniques are analyzed for detecting the botnets in inter VM and intra VM.

A variety of security solutions have been put forth to safeguard WSNs from black hole attacks. However, a majority of the solutions are cumbersome and vitality inefficient. In this paper an improvised hierarchical vitality efficient intrusion detection system is proposed, to protect sensor Network from black hole attacks.

There are two types of immunity-based agents: one is detection agent and the other is counterattack agent. Detection agents take charge of monitoring the nodes in the network, detecting the anomaly activities, and taking response to the invader, which may be viewed as T-cell lymphocyte. Counterattack agent as antibody, is built in each regular node which is regarded as B-cell. When Detection agents find invaders, they send out instructions to activate the counterattack agents in the neighbor nodes of the invaders. These Counterattack agents will surround the invaders and finally kill them.

Network performance is evaluated in terms of normalized throughput, routing overhead, normalized routing load, and average packet delay, when a percentage of nodes misbehave. Simulation results show that although the performance of all three routing protocols degrades, DSDV is the most robust routing protocol under security attacks.

Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique.

Compared to other securing routing protocols, our solution eliminates the unrealistic assumption about the availability of on-line trusted authorities or certificate repositories, thus, it can take advantage of public-key technology to prevent many types of attack from malicious nodes.

The lack of infrastructuresupport and resource constraint is the key issue that causesdishonest and non-co-operative nodes. Therefore, MANET isvulnerable to serious attacks. To reduce the hazards from suchnodes and enhance the security of the network, this paperextends an Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector(AOMDV) Routing protocol, named as Trust-based Secured Adhoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (TS-AOMDV), whichis based on the nodes' routing behavior. The proposed TSAOMDVaims at identifying and isolating the attacks such asflooding, black hole, and gray hole attacks in MANET. With thehelp of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and trust-based routing, attack identification and isolation are carried out in two phases ofrouting such as route discovery and data forwarding phase. IDSfacilitates complete routing security by observing both controlpackets and data packets that are involved in the routeidentification and the data forwarding phases. To improve therouting performance, the IDS integrates the measured statisticsinto the AOMDV routing protocol for the detection of attackers. This facilitates the TS-AOMDV to provide better routingperformance and security in MANET. Finally, the Trust basedSecured AOMDV, TS-AOMDV is compared with the existingAOMDV through the NS2 based simulation model. Theperformance evaluation reveals that the proposed TS-AOMDVimproves the performance in terms of throughput by 57.1%more than that of an AOMDV under adversary scenario.

These four component types can be grouped into two classes: server-side problems and client-side problems. The PASIS architecture addresses server-side problems, including the connections to those servers, by encoding data with threshold schemes and distributing trust amongst sets of storage servers.

Analogous to traffic normalization for network intrusion detection systems, the proposed RouteNormalizer patches ambiguities and eliminates semantically incorrect routing updates to protect against routing protocol attacks. Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates. We validate its effectiveness by showing that many well-known routing problems from operator mailing lists are correctly identified.","1530-0889;15300889","","10.1109/DSN.2007.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272952","","Frequency;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Routing protocols;Spine;Stress;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","BGP routing;RouteNormaIizer;TCP proxy;firewall;local network;network intrusion detection systems;resource-based attacks;routers;routing misbehavior;routing protocol attacks;traffic normalization","","1","","47","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597","Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization","Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning","probability;security of data","SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager","","7","","41","","20120321","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple Intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes three intrusion detection systems PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement in comparison to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","","10.1109/ISI.2008.4565049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4565049","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","Data analysis;Information analysis;Internet;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Service oriented architecture;Social network services","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","advanced sensor fusion technique;data-dependent decision fusion;enhanced intrusion detection;neural network supervised learner unit","","2","","28","","","17-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many attacks against sensor networks, the first step for an attacker is to establish itself as a legitimate node within the network. To make a sensor node capable of detecting an intruder a simple dynamic statistical model of the neighboring nodes is built in conjunction with a low-complexity detection algorithm by monitoring received packet power levels and arrival rates.","2160-4886;21604886","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512911","","Communication system security;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","detection based security scheme;dynamic statistical model;intrusion detection system;low-complexity detection algorithm;neighboring nodes;packet power levels;transceiver behaviors;wireless sensor networks","","37","","16","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An organization, not uncompromising on security, dedicates a hefty budget proportion for deploying security plans and updates. Fighting and chasing the modern attackers 24times7 has enforced thoughts of redesigning security framework. Existing perimeter is layered of border routers, firewalls, IDS, IPS, VPN devices, software architecture over DMZs and subnets, beside server and host filters and antivirus applications. These are not fully customizable against adversaries in providing strong security framework. The current deployment nature of security perimeter where these layered components are prone to various egress and ingress nasty activities raises some serious questions. The traditional perimeters do not provide sufficient security to overcome these limitations in order to provide uncompromised security nodes [3][11][12]. To address security needs efficiently, at critical knots within a network, we introduce a security framework. The proposed framework focuses three key areas related to defense-in-depth; (1) maximizing synchronization among layered security services (2) modularizing various services for better endpoint security (3) reducing traffic while providing secure mechanism for encrypted updates in traditional networks. We show through analysis and emulation that our proposed framework meets the unique security needs of network infrastructure in a better way.","","","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530293","Antivirus retention;Network access control;Network security perimeter;Network switch security;Security framework","Access control;Application software;Authentication;Communication system traffic control;Filters;Intrusion detection;Software architecture;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer networks;synchronisation;telecommunication security","network access control;network security;real-time detection technique;synchronization","","2","","18","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large portion of scanning activity is of a slow scan type and is not currently detectable by security appliances. In this proof-of-concept study, a new scan detection technique is demonstrated that also improves our understanding of Internet traffic. Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan. The data is stored in an efficient manner, allowing activity information to be retained for very long periods of time. This technique provides insight into Internet traffic by classifying known activities, giving visibility to threats to the network through scan detection, while also extending awareness of the activities occurring on the network.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2109009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720528","Security and protection;system management;traffic analysis","Backscatter;Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Probes;Protocols;Sockets","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet traffic;activity information;malicious activity detection;network activity classification schema;packet-level data;periodicity;scan detection;scan probes;scanning activity;time 24 h","","13","","35","","20110228","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a secure parent selection scheme so that each child node can select a legitimate node as its parent. In the proposed scheme, each node chooses a parent after excluding the best candidate if multiple parent candidates exist. Our scheme utilizes the fact that an attacking node claims falsely a lower rank than that of a legitimate nodes. We show that attacking nodes have no merits to claim lower ranks than true ones in a secure parent node selection scheme.

We believe that agent will help collecting efficient and useful information for IDS.","","","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809135","","Automatic control;Computer networks;Computer security;Conference management;Control systems;Distributed computing;Face detection;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents","mobile agents;security of data","MA_IDS model;distributed attack;intrusion detection system;mobile agent;simulated attack detection","","1","","55","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the increased scale of the grid and the new types of information it will transmit introduce security risks that cannot be addressed by traditional, centralized security techniques. We propose a scalable approach inspired by the complex-adaptive control systems of social insects, such as ants and bees. These systems emerge from inter-agent communication and the collective application of simple rules. The Digital Ants framework is a bio-inspired framework that uses lightweight, mobile agents. The agents communicate using digital pheromones which enable the agents to alert each other of possible cyber security issues. All communication and coordination is both localized and decentralized thereby allowing the framework to scale across the large numbers of devices that will exist in the Smart Grid. Furthermore, being lightweight makes the agents suitable for implementation on devices with limited computational resources. This paper will provide a brief overview of the Digital Ants framework and then present results from testbed-based demonstrations that show how Digital Ants can identify a cyber security attack scenario against smart meter deployments.","","","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497880","Agents;Bio-inspired;Computer security;Cyber security;Smart Grid;Smart meters","Bandwidth;Computer security;Grippers;Load flow;Smart grids;Smart meters","adaptive control;control engineering computing;mobile agents;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","bioinspired cyber security;centralized security techniques;complex-adaptive control systems;digital ant framework;digital pheromones;electric distribution systems;electric power system;interagent communication;limited computational resources;mobile agents;security risks;smart grid deployments;smart meter deployments;social insects;testbed-based demonstrations","","5","","17","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci., Wake Forest Univ., Wake Forest, NC, USA","Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), 2010 International Conference on","","2010","","","453","458","A computer security system is typically tasked with identifying an intrusion, which is defined as a set of actions that attempt to compromise, “the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of any resources provided by a computing system” [1] An attack on a computer system plays out in a series of sequential events, the granularity of which can vary drastically depending on the type of exploit. An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.","","","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852","ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence","Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation","computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems","biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, IaaS faces security challenges on account of its flexible nature. For this article, we studied the IaaS characteristics and investigated their related security challenges. We then elaborated these security challenges by exploring the security threats on live virtual machine migration as it is one of the main IaaS operations. We found that proper access control techniques and models are a critical element in enhancing IaaS and mitigating the identified security threats. Therefore, we investigated and contrasted the implemented and the proposed firewall architectures in IaaS as a firewall is a basic security appliance that enforces access control. We also explored and contrasted the proposed access control models in the IaaS. It was found that the traditional firewalls and access control models were not sufficient for IaaS. Therefore, there is a need to develop a proper access control model and enforcement techniques to mitigate IaaS security threats. Based on the security research trend and the results obtained in this article's exploration, we endorse an IaaS access control system built on a computational intelligent approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8460-5; POD:978-1-4673-8461-2","10.1109/SAI.2016.7556042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556042","IaaS;access control;firewall;live virtual machine migration;security","Access control;Cloud computing;Elasticity;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Virtual machining","","","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They generally want to avoid honeypots since it is hard to spread attacks from them, attacks are thoroughly monitored on them, and some honeypots contain planted false information. This suggests that it could be useful for a computer system to pretend it is a honeypot, to scare away smarter attackers. We examine here from a number of perspectives how this could be accomplished as a kind of ""vaccination"" of systems to reduce numbers of attacks and their severity. We develop a mathematical model of what would make an attacker go away. We report experiments with deliberate distortions on text to see at what point people could detect deception, and discover they can respond to subtle clues. We also report experiments with real attackers against a honeypot of increasing obviousness. Results show that attacks on it decreased over time which may indicate that attackers are being scared away.

A main program, being a typical intrusion detection system residing at a server, creates mobile agents called Aglets and dispatches them to the remote hosts of the network. The agents trace and detect the network traffic and look for abnormal activities by matching against a limited set of signature patterns supplied by the main machine. The agents are programmed with enough intelligence to decide whether to send the logged data (captured packets) to the main machine for further analysis. The proposed model comprises two major components: the Intrusion Detection Component with the Mobile Agent Platform, and distributed intelligent mobile agents.

Schmid","Tel Aviv Univ., Tel Aviv, Israel","2016 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW)","","2016","","","296","303","Traffic inspection is a fundamental building block of many security solutions today. For example, to prevent the leakage or exfiltration of confidential insider information, as well as to block malicious traffic from entering the network, most enterprises today operate intrusion detection and prevention systems that inspect traffic. However, the state-of-the-art inspection systems do not reflect well the interests of the different involved autonomous roles. For example, employees in an enterprise, or a company outsourcing its network management to a specialized third party, may require that their traffic remains confidential, even from the system administrator. Moreover, the rules used by the intrusion detection system, or more generally the configuration of an online or offline anomaly detection engine, may be provided by a third party, e.g., a security research firm, and can hence constitute a critical business asset which should be kept confidential. Today, it is often believed that accounting for these additional requirements is impossible, as they contradict efficiency and effectiveness. We in this paper explore a novel approach, called Privacy Preserving Inspection (PRI), which provides a solution to this problem, by preserving privacy of traffic inspection and confidentiality of inspection rules and configurations, and e.g., also supports the flexible installation of additional Data Leak Prevention (DLP) rules specific to the company.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3690-5; POD:978-1-5090-3691-2","10.1109/SPW.2016.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7527782","Insider Threats;Intrusion Detection;Privacy;SGX;Traffic Inspection;Trusted Hardware","Companies;Cryptography;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Privacy","Internet;authorisation;cryptography;data privacy","PRI;anomaly detection engine;encrypted network traffic inspection;intrusion detection;privacy preserving inspection;security research firm;security solution","","","","","","","22-26 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users with power credentials can do almost anything they want with the systems they own with very little control or oversight.

The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. This paper presents (1) the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS), a framework that provides a solution to this problem and meet the above mentioned challenges, and (2) a proof-of-concept prototype that embeds self-protection capabilities into traditional Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). AVPS focuses on self-protection against security policy violations instead of malware, vulnerability, or exploit intrusions.

"An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers","D. Guo; L. N. Bhuyan; B. Liu","Microsoft Corporation, Mountain View","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2012","20","5","1426","1439","L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","3","","40","","20111212","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected. The soundness of these constraints was verified using a formal framework, and a prototype implementation of the sensor was evaluated with realistic AMI network traffic.","","","10.1109/PRDC.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133080","AMI;formal method;intrusion detection;specification-based security","Authentication;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Reliability;Timing","automatic meter reading;computer network security;formal specification;power distribution reliability;power meters;power system measurement;power system security;sensors;smart power grids;transport protocols","AMI network traffic;C12.22 standard protocol;access points;advanced metering infrastructure;energy distribution infrastructure reliability;innovative situational awareness solutions;modernized power grid security;security policy;security threat identify;sensor;smart meters;specification based intrusion detection;traffic monitoring","","42","","34","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Performance of an IDS in an Adhoc Network under Black Hole and Gray Hole attacks","M. Ahmed; M. A.

The Wireless networks are susceptible to many attacks like Black Hole Attacks, Gray Hole Attacks, Worm Hole Attacks, Sink Hole, Sleep Deprivation Torture, Sybil Attack etc. These Networks needs to be protected using firewalls, encryption software, network failure detection schemes for detecting the attacks and minimizing their effects. Many of these schemes designed so far are not absolute and require more supporting systems. Therefore an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is important to identify the malicious nodes, isolate the problem created by such nodes and notify the information of the malicious node to the other nodes. The ultimate aim of these schemes is to provide the necessary security cover to the network by adding encryption to maintain confidentiality and integrity. In this paper, we introduce a novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and examine the performance of the network by introducing. Black Hole Attack and Gray Hole Attack.

Proceedings. 20th IEEE Symposium on","","2001","","","99","108","Local and wide area network information assurance analysts need current and precise knowledge about their system activities in order to address the challenges of critical infrastructure protection. In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance.

However, it is not guaranteed that the bandwidth necessary to transmit all aggregated alerts is always available, which usually result in the transmission of a portion of the alerts, while others are discarded or queued. The transmission of insufficient alert information hinders making correct decisions about attacks, leading to compromising network security. In order to maximize the benefits of data aggregation while minimizing the impact of partial alerts, this paper presents a risk-driven real-time transmission prioritization technique for implementing lossy and lossless aggregation of cyber alerts. Lossy alert aggregation and transmission are managed adaptively by allowing the prioritization and transmission of aggregated alerts according to the risk assessment of such alerts. This paper also presents a risk-driven utilization model that further adapts the aggregation and prioritization in response to dynamic network conditions. The performance results of the proposed techniques are obtained by running simulations on data collected from a mobile network. Simulation results for the aggregation of raw alerts have shown an average reduction of 51% in data storage space and bandwidth usage.","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785305","Alert Aggregation;Cyber Security;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Networks;Transmission Prioritization","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Propagation losses","mobile computing;security of data","alert aggregation;alert generation;alert information;cyber alerts;data aggregation;lossless aggregation;lossy aggregation;lossy alert aggregation;mobile networks;partial alerts;real-time transmission prioritization technique;risk driven aggregation prioritization;risk driven utilization model;security data","","0","","11","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, current software-based methods are difficult to process a large amount of data in anomaly-based IDSs and cannot keep up the high-link speeds. The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS.

"Distributed Intrusion Detection System for Wireless Sensor Networks","K. Medhat; R. A. Ramadan; I. Talkhan","Comput. Eng. Dept., Cairo Univ., Cairo, Egypt","Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies, 2015 9th International Conference on","","2015","","","234","239","Wireless Sensor Networks is extensively used in many of applications related to different fields. Some of those applications deal with confidential and critical data that must be protected from unauthorized access. Some other systems use WSNs that are deployed in very harsh environments with limited energy resources. Those systems cannot tolerate network failures that can be caused by network intruders. In this paper, an efficient intrusion detection model is introduced. The model uses intelligent techniques to detect intrusions. Two different architectures are introduced. The first architecture represents the level of sensor node, sink node, and base station. The second architecture represents the levels of sensor and sink nodes. This work proposes two intrusion detection algorithms, one uses a supervised learning mechanism to be used on the level of the sensor node and the other uses an unsupervised learning mechanism to be used on the levels of both the sink node and base station. The output of the algorithms is a set of detection rules which are structured in the form of binary tree. The introduced algorithms provided a high detection accuracy using less number of selected features, compared to previous work for intrusion detection, which decreases the complexity and the processing time. The proposed learning algorithms used only 10% of the data for training. An enhancement for J48 classification algorithm is also introduced which decreases the size of the algorithm's decision tree and makes it suitable to be used for intrusion detection in WSNs.","","","10.1109/NGMAST.2015.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373249","Classification;Clustering;Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Networks Security;feature selection","Base stations;Classification algorithms;Complexity theory;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Unsupervised learning;Wireless sensor networks","decision trees;security of data;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","J48 classification algorithm;base station;binary tree;decision tree;distributed intrusion detection system;intelligent techniques;sensor node;sink node;unsupervised learning mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","","9-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Outlier detection is a data mining task consisting in the discovery of observations which deviate substantially from the rest of the data, and has many important practical applications. Outlier detection in very large data sets is however computationally very demanding and currently requires highperformance computing facilities. We propose a family of parallel algorithms for Graphic Processing Units (GPU), derived from two distance-based outlier detection algorithms: the BruteForce and the SolvingSet.

Ninth International Symposium on","","2004","1","","331","338 Vol.1","In This work we propose a new distributed intrusion detection system (IDS) designed for mobile ad hoc network (MANET) environments. The complete distribution of the intrusion detection process is the salient feature of our proposition: distribution is not restricted to data collection but also applied to execution of the detection algorithm and alert correlation. Each node in the MANET runs a local IDS (LIDS) that cooperates with others LIDS. A mobile agent framework is used to preserve the autonomy of each LIDS while providing a flexible technique for exploring the natural redundancies in MANET to compensate for the dynamic state of wireless links between high mobility nodes. The proposed solution has been validated by actual implementation, which is described in the paper. Three attacks are presented as illustrative examples of the IDS mechanisms. Attack detection is formally described by specification of data collection, attack signatures associated with such data and alerts generation and correlation.

The resource-constraint characteristics of WSNs limit the secure design and development of security protocols and presumably thwart the integration of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Whilst, sensor nodes which usually operate in unattended and even harsh environments, are prone to failures and vulnerable to malicious attacks. For reliable and secure communications in WSNs, intrusion-tolerant routing becomes possibly a critical attribute that should be integrated into WSNs. However, there was not much research investigated on this topic. In order to provide a useful starting point for researchers interested in the subject, in this paper, we comparatively study two intrusion-tolerant routing protocols for WSNs, namely INSENS and ITSRP. Simulations were especially invested to assess their practicality. We also propose some suggestions to improve these two protocols. Although the feasibility of our suggestions is still questionable and deserves more investigation, we consider this study as the first step to fulfill the design of intrusion-tolerant WSNs as well as to build a complete intrusion-tolerant framework hereafter.","","","10.1109/BWCCA.2015.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424793","Attack tolerance;Intrusion-tolerance;Performance Evaluation;Routing;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","IDS;INSENS routing protocols;ITSRP routing protocols;WSN;communication reliability;intrusion detection system;intrusion-tolerant routing protocols;malicious attack vulnerability;resource-constraint characteristics;secure communications;security protocol development;wireless sensor networks","","","","20","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present an adaptive and evolving security (AES), and an adaptive trust management (ATM) approach to such autonomic messaging middleware systems, an approach that learns, anticipates, evolves and adapts to a changing environment at run-time in the face of changing threats.

Conventional schemes place security devices (middleboxes) at a few choke points (e.g., core routers) and rely on routing policy to guarantee middlebox traversal. Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers. This paper explains the framework of HSA, describes the key techniques, presents a testbed to validate the design, and discusses future research directions.","1550-3607;15503607","","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364521","","Hardware;Middleboxes;Routing;Scalability;Security;Servers;Software","computer centres;computer network security;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","HSA;choke points;core routers;coupling routing;data center networks;guarantee middle box traversal;hybrid security architecture;multitenant data centers;place security devices;routing policy;security services;security system;software middleboxes;switches","","1","2","18","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches.

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology.

Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link. Thus lot of well behaved node may be avoided by network which results in losing of well behaved routes. To eliminate the requirement of predistributed keys proposed system considers Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm.","","","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892733","Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm;EAACK;IDS;MANET","Classification algorithms;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Random access memory;Routing","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm;EAACK;IDS Watchdog;MANET;MRA;S-ACK;acknowledgement packets;ambiguous collisions;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;misbehavior report authentication;mobile ad hoc network;mobile nodes;node misbehavior detection;one-hop ACK;receiver collisions;routing protocol;secure ACK;wireless links","","1","","9","","","13-14 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applications of artificial neural networks to characterize the behavior of users have been well studied in the recent past, without considering the enormous time they take to get modeled.

When WSNs are deployed in inaccessible areas, the probability of occurring different types of attacks is very high. So the security of WSN becomes extremely important. As sensors have limited processing power, limited storage, low bandwidth, and energy; traditional security measures designed for the resource-rich networks such as LAN etc. are not suitable for the resource-constrained WSN. In presence of such limitations it becomes mandatory to devise lightweight security solutions for data transmission in WSNs. Because of problems in public key cryptography such as costly key computation, longer keys, key vulnerability to brute force attack, key distribution and maintenance, etc., it is not preferred for WSN. The less computation and low memory requirements of symmetric key cryptography with very short length of key (lightweight) justifies its use in WSN to achieve information security. Hence, this paper aims to study, discuss and analyze the Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms Suitable for Wireless Sensor Networks.","","","10.1109/ICCN.2015.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507438","Authenticity;Availability;Confidentiality;Data Freshness;Integrity;Lightweight Cryptography","Communication system security;Cryptography;Monitoring;Schedules;Vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","data transmission;environmental conditions;lightweight cryptographic algorithms;lightweight cryptography;public key cryptography;resource constrained WSN;resource rich networks;small sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","","","","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA.

Black hole attacks are potentially devastating attacks on wireless sensor networks in which a malicious node uses spurious route updates to attract network traffic that it then drops. We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","1934-5070;19345070","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed.

In this paper we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential adhoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular node can support a network-monitoring node. The detection of intrusions in the network is done with the help of Cellular Automata (CA). IDFADNWCA (Intrusion Detection for Adhoc Networks with Cellular Automata) focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and determines the network monitors. Power Level Metric in the network results in maintaining power for network monitoring, with monitors changing often, since it is an iterative power optimal solution to identify nodes for distributed agent based intrusion detection.

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can measure the association relations accurately and robustly.","","","10.1109/SKG.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816584","Association Link Network;semantic link network;video organizing;video representing","Cognition;Organizing;Publishing;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web pages;YouTube","Internet;Web sites;video retrieval","Flickr;YouTube;association link network model;association-rich network;cognitive science;intelligent Web activities;semantic content;semantic link network;video representation;video resources organization","","0","","24","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents. We deploy NETSECVISOR in both virtual test networks and a commercial switch environment to evaluate its performance and feasibility. The evaluation results show that our prototype only adds a very small overhead while providing desired network security virtualization to network users/administrators.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2453936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152892","Security;Software-Defined Networking;Virtualization;software-defined networking;virtualization","Communication networks;Monitoring;Prototypes;Routing;Security;Switches;Virtualization","computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;virtualisation","NETSECVISOR prototype system;commercial switch environment;first step toward network security virtualization;fixed-location security devices;low management cost;network security devices;network security management;security policy;security protection;security resource utilization;security response functions;software-defined networking technology;virtual test networks","","1","","37","","20150708","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Third International Conference on","","2007","","","224","233","Remote network attacks are a serious problem facing network administrators today. OpenFire uses deception to interfere with the reconnaissance phase. Unlike traditional firewalls, instead of blocking unwanted traffic, it accepts all traffic, forwarding unwanted messages to a cluster of decoy machines. To the outside, all ports and all IP addresses appear open in an OpenFire network. OpenFire uses the honeypot concept in its design. However, unlike traditional honeypots, OpenFire attempts to present additional false targets by making it appear to an attacker that all ports, including unused ones, and all unused IP addresses of an organization are open, with the thesis that this will help divert attacks from real services to false services. In our experiments, we defined an attack to be snort’s priority 1 alert. During a 21-day evaluation period, we found that OpenFire reduced the number of attacks on real services by 65% as compared to an unprotected system and by 46% as compared to a Honeypot-protected system. We present OpenFire’s design, its performance, and defenses against some potential attacks.","","","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550337","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Computer worms;Filling;IP networks;Probes;Protection;Reconnaissance;Storage area networks;Telecommunication traffic","","","","1","","31","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, clear design guidelines and techniques for the support of scalable IMS-based deployment, especially for data-intensive services such as mobility management, presence, and instant messaging, are still missing. That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

In this work we use two cost models. The first cost model assumes that all network intrusion detection devices have the same cost. The second model assumes that the cost of the device is relative to the traffic load on the network node on which it is installed. We evaluate two algorithms for finding the most prominent group in these cost models. The first algorithm is based on greedy choice of vertices and the second is based on heuristic search and finds the optimal deployment locations. We investigate combinations of heuristic functions based on solution cost and on solution utility and different node ordering strategies. We show that intelligent choice of the heuristic functions and node ordering can speed up the search. Empirical evaluation shows that while in the first cost model the greedy algorithm produces results that are negligibly close to optimal in the second cost model the difference between optimal and suboptimal solutions can be significant.","1550-3607;15503607","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502182","","Communications Society;Cost function;Greedy algorithms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;search problems","DNIDS deployment utility;DNIPS;cost benefit deployment;cost model;group betweenness centrality;heuristic search;high-speed network;large-scale network;network intrusion detection devices;real time distributed network intrusion detection systems","","0","","27","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible.

Our first step toward this objective is to develop a prototype database and query interface to identify coordinated scanning activity in network attack data. We have created a set of aggregate views and templatized SQL queries that consider timing, persistence, targeted services, spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion, thereby enabling us to evaluate coordinated scanning along these dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of the interface by conducting a case study on a set of firewall and intrusion detection system logs from Dshield.org. We show that the interface is able to identify general characteristics of coordinated activity as well as instances of unusual activity that would otherwise be difficult to mine from the data.

Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes.

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2004.1269717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269717","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;mobile radio;network topology;telecommunication security","automatic retaliation;hacking;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;security mechanisms;wireless ad hoc networks","","163","4","13","","","Feb 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the rapid increase of link speeds and throughputs - especially in larger networks such as backbone networks - seriously constrains this approach. First, devices capable of detecting intrusions on high-speed links of 10 Gbps and higher are rather expensive, or must be built based on complex arrays. Second, legislation commonly restricts the way in which backbone network operators can analyse the data in their networks. To overcome these constraints, flow-based intrusion detection can be applied, which traditionally focuses only on packet header fields and packet characteristics.

A virtual network redeems the administrators and network designers from its complexity not only by reducing the number of devices required, to a specific workstation that will take as input the various policies pertaining to the packets to be sent but also by including various routing rules and response techniques for malicious attacks. The Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) algorithm is used to improve the security on an existing virtual network security called the NETSECVISOR. The ABE algorithm uses attributes that are known to the participants involved in the transmission and reception of packets. This helps ease the process of creation and retrieval of keys for encryption and decryption notwithstanding the performance of security that will be enhanced for the virtual network.","","DVD:978-1-5090-1276-3; Electronic:978-1-5090-1277-0; POD:978-1-5090-1278-7","10.1109/ICCPCT.2016.7530249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530249","Attribute Based Encryption algorithm;Open Flow;Software Defined Networking;Virtual network;network security","Cloud computing;Communication networks;Encryption;Middleboxes;Organizations;Virtualization","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;virtual private networks","ABE algorithm;NETSECVISOR;attribute based encryption algorithm;complexity;data confidentiality;decryption;malicious attacks;middle-boxes;multifarious task;network designers;routing rules;security nodes;user authentication;virtual network security;workstation","","","","","","","18-19 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Improving network management with software defined networking","H. Kim; N. Feamster","Georgia Institute of Technology","IEEE Communications Magazine","","2013","51","2","114","119","Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how SDN can improve common network management tasks.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461195","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Control systems;Home automation;Logic gates;Software radio;Telecommunication network management","computer network management;high level languages;telecommunication security","SDN;complex high-level network policy;high-level policy language;logically centralized software program;low-level vendor-specific configuration;network management;packet forwarding device;secure communication;software defined networking;stop-gap solution","","178","2","13","","","February 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

To train and analyze detection mechanisms, researchers typically simulate the DDoS traffic in the testbed; while for Flash Crowds, most researchers replay the web server captures obtained from third parties. This paper proposes the design of a special testbed-based simulation method with Spirent Test Center hardware platform, to simulate both DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic.

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","1530-2075;15302075","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors.

This paper evaluates several key string matching algorithms using a comprehensive simulation framework. Starting from a uniprocessor profiling, the framework constructs task graphs for string matching algorithms. Then task graphs are mapped onto NPs together with other network applications. The system throughput is determined by the analytical performance model. With this framework, we can evaluate the performance of different string matching algorithms on NPs. Our results show that shift table based algorithms (SFKSearch and Wu-Manber) and finite automaton based Aho-Corasick are complementary: SFKSearch and Wu-Manber do better job in NPs for good packet and larger pattern length due to better inter-task parallelism and shifting; Aho-Corasick does not depend on minimal pattern length and shows relative small processing cost variation between bad and good packets.","2161-5322;21615322","","10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493512","","Analytical models;Automata;Computational modeling;Costs;Heart;Internet;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Performance analysis;Throughput","security of data;string matching","Internet;analytical performance model;intrusion detection systems;network processors;string matching algorithms","","1","","21","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack.

The approach addresses the underlying distributed and cooperative nature of wireless ad hoc networks and adds one more dimension of cooperation to the intrusion detection process. That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors. Without the requirements of pre-labeled attack data, the approach eliminates the time-consuming labeling process and the impacts of imbalanced dataset. Besides, the concept of software agent technology has been applied in system implementation, which provides further support for distributed wireless ad hoc networks","1521-9097;15219097","","10.1109/ICPADS.2006.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655710","","Ad hoc networks;Automation;Communication system security;Contracts;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data;software agents;telecommunication security","agent-based cooperative anomaly detection;distributed wireless ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;software agent;wireless ad hoc network security","","6","1","16","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes.

Clustering can be made effective in CEAACK MANETs by opting for a cluster head mechanism which ensures that control rests with a single powerful node within a cluster. This cluster head takes on the responsibility of routing the packets efficiently by coordinating with the base station. Cluster heads are also prone to malicious attacks and is affected more than a normal network. In this paper we try to incorporate a new approach in CEAACK MANETs by implementing a cryptographic technique to tackle the vulnerabilities of the network. This cryptographic is highly secure which uses a distinct classified digital key which can be generated dynamically using the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) Algorithm.

While the recent push for a “Smart Grid” has shown promise for increased efficiency, security has often been an after-thought, leaving this critical infrastructure vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, devices crucial to the safe operation of the power grid are left in remote substations with their configuration interfaces completely open, providing a vector for outsiders as well as insiders to launch an attack. This paper develops the framework for an overlay network of gateway devices that provide authenticated access control and security monitoring for these vulnerable interfaces. We develop a working prototype of such a device and simulate the performance of deployment throughout a substation. Our results suggest that such a system can be deployed with negligible impact on normal operations, while providing important security mechanisms. By doing so, we demonstrate that our proposal is a practical and efficient solution for retro-fitting security onto crucial power system devices.","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007774","","Maintenance engineering;Performance evaluation;Security;Smart grids;Substations;Universal Serial Bus","authorisation;message authentication;overlay networks;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;smart power grids;substations","authenticated access control;configuration interfaces;cyber attacks;gateway devices;insider threat mitigation;overlay network;physical overlay framework;power grid;power system devices;remote substations;retro-fitting security;security mechanisms;security monitoring;smart grid","","1","","22","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However P2P systems can be potential vehicle for active worms which can spread in all manager peers in a short time. This issue has not been studied in the literature. In this paper we address effects of active worm propagation in a P2P network management system in which nodes are structured in several hierarchal levels. We intend to evaluate the speed of propagation in the system. To aim at this goal, we perform extensive simulation study and investigate the parameters influencing the speed of propagation such as the number of vulnerable host managers, degree of connections between peer managers inside the groups, the number of connections between different groups of managers in the hierarchical structure. We further compare worm propagation in different levels of hierarchy by different types of active worm attack strategies. We show that in addition to P2P parameters hierarchical structure affect the speed of active worm propagation. This issue suggests that P2P network management systems are more vulnerable in comparison to classical NMSs when they face to security attacks. Therefore to realize implementation of P2P NMSs security concerns should be taken into account.","","","10.1109/CTRQ.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5176069","Active Worm Attacks;Network Management Systems;P2P systems","Conference management;Equations;Information security;Peer to peer computing;Power system management;Quality management;Reliability theory;Technology management;Tin;Topology","computer network management;computer viruses;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security","P2P system;active worm attack strategies;active worm propagation;hierarchal level structure;hierarchical peer-to-peer network management system","","0","1","9","","","20-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The core of this architecture, a novel energy efficient, disruption tolerant, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocol (EERD), provides offloading data for long term storage by sending data to farm servers via sinks that are a part of a MANET and handles in-situ queries issued by users collocated with the animals. The energy efficiency is achieved by dynamic adaptation to the current behavior of the animals carrying the monitoring devices. We discuss the practical feasibility of this architecture by analyzing data from the extensive field experiments we performed. We address the challenges posed by the practical deployment.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200","Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy","Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security","Internet;computer network security;data privacy","DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure","","1","","56","","20150210","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes the key challenges to implement fault-tolerant and efficient deployments of collaborative autonomous aircraft to increase operational reliability and performance when performing aerial sensing and assessment. Some challenges are introduced by mobility, such as wireless communication, group navigation, and data collection. Security also represents a challenge during the operation of the MANET. We consider the effects of limited resources (e.g., real-time processing power, battery packs) available on the aircraft.

Lin","","Big Data, 2013 IEEE International Conference on","","2013","","","606","612","The visualization of complex network traffic involving a large number of communication devices is a common yet challenging task. Traditional layout methods create the network graph with overwhelming visual clutter, which hinders the network understanding and traffic analysis tasks. The existing graph simplification algorithms (e.g. community-based clustering) can effectively reduce the visual complexity, but lead to less meaningful traffic representations. In this paper, we introduce a new method to the traffic monitoring and anomaly analysis of large networks, namely Structural Equivalence Grouping (SEG). Based on the intrinsic nature of the computer network traffic, SEG condenses the graph by more than 20 times while preserving the critical connectivity information. Computationally, SEG has a linear time complexity and supports undirected, directed and weighted traffic graphs up to a million nodes. We have built a Network Security and Anomaly Visualization (NSAV) tool based on SEG and conducted case studies in several real-world scenarios to show the effectiveness of our technique.","","","10.1109/BigData.2013.6691629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691629","Graph Compression;Security;Visualization","Complexity theory;Data visualization;Image color analysis;Layout;Security;Vectors;Visualization","computer network security;graph theory;telecommunication traffic","NSAV tool;SEG;anomaly analysis;community-based clustering;complex network traffic;compressed graph;computer network traffic;graph simplification algorithm;linear time complexity;network graph;network security and anomaly visualization;scalable network traffic visualization;structural equivalence grouping;traffic monitoring;undirected traffic graph;visual clutter;visual complexity;weighted traffic graph","","4","","19","","","6-9 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WMNs provide reliable connectivity and fault-tolerance, as each node is connected to several other nodes. If a node fails due to hardware problems, its neighbors can find another route. Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network. This paper presents an algorithm for detection of selfish nodes in a WMN that uses statistical theory of inference for reliable clustering of the nodes.

In this paper, we present EliMet, a framework that combines information from different sources and estimates the extent to which a control network meets its security objective. Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Our experimental results show that EliMet can optimally make use of prior knowledge as well as automated inference techniques to minimize human involvement and efficiently deduce the expert knowledge regarding individual states of that particular system.","1530-0889;15300889","","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263941","Power grid critical infrastructure;intrusion detection and response;security metric;situational awareness","Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Security","control engineering computing;inference mechanisms;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system protection;power system security","EliMet;automated inference techniques;bulk electricity delivery system;complex power-grid control network protection;power grid critical infrastructures;security assessment techniques;security incidents;security measures;security metric elicitation","","6","","42","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work proposes a tree based algorithm called CIF Mine (Constraint based Incremental Frequent Pattern Mining) to mine the incremental data by using dataset filtering constraints like specific pattern, length of the pattern and user defined minimum support threshold which reduces the size of the dataset before constructing the tree.

Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network. To facilitate such issue trust is a prominent factor to defend against security issues in MANET.

"How to Distribute the Detection Load among Virtual Machines to Maximize the Detection of Distributed Attacks in the Cloud?","O. A. Wahab; J. Bentahar; H. Otrok; A. Mourad","","2016 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","","2016","","","316","323","Security has been identified to be the principal stumbling-block preventing users and enterprises from moving their businesses to the cloud. The reason is that cloud systems, besides inheriting all the vulnerabilities of the traditional computing systems, appeal to new types of threats engendered mainly by the virtualization concept that allows multiple users' virtual machines (VMs) to share a common computing platform. This broadens the attack space of the malicious users and increases their ability to attack both the cloud system and other co-resident VMs. Motivated by the absence of any approach that addresses the problem of optimal detection load distribution in the domain of cloud computing, we develop a resource-aware maxmin game theoretical model that guides the hypervisor on how the detection load should be optimally distributed among its guest VMs in the real-time. The objective is to maximize the hypervisor's probability of detection, knowing that the attacker is dividing the attack over several VMs to minimize this probability. Experimental results on Amazon EC2 pricing dataset reveal that our model increases the probability of detecting distributed attacks, reduces the false positives, and minimizes the resources wasted during the detection process.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2628-9; POD:978-1-5090-2629-6","10.1109/SCC.2016.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7557468","Detection load distribution;cloud computing;distributed attack;security;virtualization","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Games;Hardware;Monitoring;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","","","","","","","","","June 27 2016-July 2 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At any point in time, cloud providers, users, or application developers arguably require to understand the status of different components, monitor business processes, and analyse machine logs in real time. However, there are no specialised search engines for the systematic analysis of logs by different cloud providers. Hence, this paper presents Simha, an agent-based document search service for cloud platforms. It implements a proof of concept system to analyse user documents, logs, and folders in real time from different virtual machines.

Khademzadeh","Islamic Azad University(South Tehran Branch)","Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE), 2010 23rd Canadian Conference on","","2010","","","1","5","In this paper, we propose a game-theoretical based method to fortify an intrusion detection system (IDS) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). And we focus on dropping-packet attacks which are the sore point in wireless sensor networks. We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN. Based on rationality we believe that even malicious nodes before being known as extreme notorious nodes, they try to impersonate their true type and show a little collaborative behavior.","0840-7789;08407789","","10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575157","Nash equilibrium;Subgame perfect equilibrium;WSN — Intrusion detection system (IDS);attack-resistant mechanism;repeated game","Games;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nash equilibrium;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-defense problem;cooperative Nash equilibrium;dropping-packet attacks;game-theoretical model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","1","","23","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on","","2004","","","218","227","An attack-resistant network is a purpose-built network to survive attacks; by construction, it should be both resilient and secure. Resiliency is the ability to provide alternative communication paths should one path become disrupted due to failures or attacks; while security is the ability to contain and limit the impact of compromises. Interestingly, these two can present conflicting demands. We provide a first formulation of a new class of problems focusing on the engineering of attack-resistant networks. Our model considers both resiliency and security, and uses a notion of blocking probability as a rigorous measure for evaluating different network constructions. We propose several efficient approximation algorithms for computing blocking probability and provide bounds for their errors. Based on these algorithms, we introduce a family of heuristics to guide the construction of optimal attack-resistant networks with minimum blocking probabilities. We also present extensive results to evaluate and demonstrate the near-optimal performance of our heuristics and approximation algorithms.","1092-1648;10921648","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348112","","Approximation algorithms;Computer crime;Filtering;Heuristic algorithms;Internet;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network servers;Resists;Routing protocols;Security","Internet;probability;telecommunication security","Internet;attack-resistant network;computing blocking probability;purpose-built network;security model","","5","","13","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the industry wide adaptation of service-oriented architecture (SOA), web services have become an integral component of enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges. Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant. In this paper we provide an overview of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis techniques to discover these vulnerabilities.

Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers. In addition, based on real data run in POWER WORLD for IEEE benchmark power systems, and through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that BLITHE outperforms the state of arts for detecting abnormal behaviors in pervasive smart grid applications.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2459049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163500","Insider threat detection;security;smart grid","Cryptography;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Power measurement;Smart grids;State estimation","IEEE standards;load flow;power system security;power system state estimation;smart power grids;statistical analysis","BLITHE;DC power flow model;IEEE benchmark power system;POWER WORLD;abnormal behavior detection;behavior rule-based insider threat detection;behavior specification;compliance-distance-based grading strategy;data monitor device;rule-weight grading strategy;smart grid;state estimation model;statistical property","","0","","48","","20150721","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Urey","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina, USA","SoutheastCon 2015","","2015","","","1","6","Peer-to-peer networks are continuously becoming more popular for sharing data and resources. However, a major drawback of this type of network is its ability to maintain security, since there is no centralized server to oversee the network. One way to remedy this problem is through the use of intelligent mobile agents. These agents will act as guards, which will essentially roam the network and periodically check on each node to ensure that it is not under attack. In our previous research, we have proposed algorithms for initial placement of agents in a given peer-to-peer network. As the agents are mobile, the next issue with agent-based security is how the agents should roam around the network to detect attacks. We want the agents to scan the entire network as quickly as possible which will minimize the detection time of attacks. If we run too many agents simultaneously to scan the network, they will consume system resources which will slow down the performance of applications running on the peer-to-peer network. In this paper we have proposed three roaming algorithms for agents. The first algorithm Heavy Scan Algorithm scans the network with minimum time by sacrificing the performance of the application. The second algorithm Light Scan Algorithm takes the maximum time to complete the scan of the entire network with less degradation of the performance of the application. The third algorithm Medium Scan Algorithm balances time to complete the scan with performance of the application. We have illustrated the proposed algorithms with an example. We have also analyzed the complexity of the proposed algorithms.","1091-0050;10910050","","10.1109/SECON.2015.7132990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7132990","agents;intrusion detection;peer-to-peer networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Delays;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer-to-peer computing","computational complexity;computer network security;mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing","agent-based security;attack detection time;centralized server;data sharing;heavy scan algorithm;intelligent mobile agents;light scan algorithm;medium scan algorithm;peer-to-peer network;resource sharing;roaming agents;roaming algorithms","","1","","9","","","9-12 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: application layer IDS (AIDS), transport layer IDS (TIDS), network layer IDS (NIDS) and link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type. The experimental results indicate that each IDS type has different features set that can not only improve the overall performance of the IDS, but it also can improve its scalability.","","","10.1109/WAINA.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136630","Intrusion detection systems;TCP/IP network model;features ranking;features selection;support vector decision function;support vector machines","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data processing;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Support vector machines;TCPIP","security of data;transport protocols","TCP/IP network layer;application layer;information security;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network allocation;network devices;transport layer","","2","","24","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As engineering educators whose academic focus is information assurance and cyber security, we believe students in cyber security need the same type of access to hands on opportunities as their counter parts in hardware design or circuit design.

Further, they need exposure to working in the complexity of the Internet. While some might argue that simulation software could be a solution, it often lacks realism. In this paper we show how our institution goes beyond the providing the standard, formalized laboratory activities for our cyber security students by developing a unique, highly configurable testbed called Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment (ISEAGE - pronounced “ice age”) that allows us to imitate the Internet. ISEAGE provides a controlled environment that allows real attacks to be played out against the students' networks and demonstrates to them real world security concepts. This paper provides an overview of how the ISEAGE security testbed functions, as well as illustrates how ISEAGE provides our students five different types of opportunities for real world experience: support of formalized classroom work; cyber defense competitions for high school, community college and four year students; inquiry-based learning in a playground environment for high school, as well as college students; testing environment for network devices such as firewalls, data loss protection, intrusion detection; research environment for senior and graduate student work.","0190-5848;01905848","","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685034","cyber security;information assurance education;laboratory exercises;testbed","Computer security;Computers;Educational institutions;Internet;Servers;Testing","Internet;computational complexity;computer aided instruction;computer science education;digital simulation;security of data","ISEAGE security testbed functions;Internet complexity;Internet-scale event attack and generation environment;circuit design;college students;cyber defense competitions;cyber security professional tool kit;cyber security students;data loss protection;engineering educators;engineering programs;firewalls;formalized classroom work;graduate student work;hardware design;high school students;information assurance;inquiry-based learning;intrusion detection;laboratory exercises;learning experiences;playground environment;simulation software;synthesizing experiences;technology programs","","0","","4","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this, traffic from an identified attacker is redirected to an alternative server where damage can be mitigated.

Thus, in this paper, we study middlebox placement problem, i.e., given network information and policy specifications, we attempt to determine the optimal locations to place the middleboxes so that the performance is optimized. The performance metrics studied in this paper include the end-to-end delay and the bandwidth consumption, which cover both users’ and network providers’ interests. We first formulate it as 0-1 programming problem, and prove it is NP-hard. We then propose two heuristic algorithms to obtain the sub-optimal solutions. The first algorithm is a greedy algorithm, and the second algorithm is based on simulated annealing. Through extensive simulations, we show that in comparison with a baseline algorithm, the proposed algorithms can reduce 22% end-to-end delay and save 38% bandwidth consumption on average. The formulation and proposed algorithms have no special assumption on network topology or policy specifications, therefore, they have broad range of applications in various types of networks such as enterprise, data center and broadband access networks.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2015.2502252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332796","Middlebox placement;Service chaining;algorithm design;performance optimization","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Delays;Heuristic algorithms;Middleboxes;Routing;Servers","","","","","","","","20151120","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future.

Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power. We have parallelized a popular string searching algorithm, Aho-Corasick, on the IBM Cell/B.E. processor, with the goal of performing exact string matching against large dictionaries.

More number of heterogeneous networks are created and deployed by government as well as by private firms. Due to the distance, mobility, behavior of nodes in the networks and dynamic in nature, it is essential to provide security for all the networks separately or distributed. Various existing approaches discuss about the security issues and challenges for heterogeneous networks. In this paper a Leader Based Intrusion Detection System [LBIDS] is proposed to detect and prevent DOS as well as other attacks such as Sybil and Sinkhole in the networks by deploying the Leader Based Intrusion Detection System into access points in the networks. The proposed approach utilizes three core security challenges such as Authentication, positive incentive provision and preventing DOS. In addition to that it will do packet verification and IP verification for improving the efficiency in terms of detection and prevention against attacks in heterogeneous networks. The simulation of our proposed approach is carried out in NS2 software and the results were given.","","","10.1109/IBSS.2015.7456671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456671","Heterogeneous Networks;Intrusion Detection System;Leader Based Intrusion Detection System;Wireless Sensor Network","Authentication;Heterogeneous networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;message authentication;wireless sensor networks","DOS prevention;IP verification;LBIDS;NS2 software;Sinkhole;Sybil;access points;authentication;data transmission;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intruder prevention;leader based intrusion detection system;packet verification;positive incentive provision;private firms","","","","18","","","10-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Centralised approaches benefit from simplicity of implementation and high algorithm expressiveness, but suffer in terms of scalability. The scalability issue is alleviated with hierarchical and decentralised approaches, but this comes at a cost of additional implementation complexity and lower algorithm quality. Introduced is a new alert correlation architecture based on Hadoop. The developed architecture allows for greater scalability whilst maintaining algorithm expressiveness and design simplicity. It incorporates alert aggregation, verification, and correlation components, which together provide for a clear and succinct view of potentially malicious activity. Each component was tested against a series of datasets that represent potential real world scenarios across a cluster of varying size. The results demonstrate that all components in the architecture have the ability to scale across many nodes in a cluster, allowing for the processing of large and complex attack scenarios in a timely manner.","","","10.1109/CCST.2015.7389673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389673","Hadoop;aggregation;correlation;verification","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Scalability","data handling;formal verification;parallel processing;security of data;software architecture","Hadoop;IDS;alert aggregation;alert correlation architecture;alert verification;attack scenario;intrusion detection system","","","","17","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module. This architecture is simulated with both behavior simulation in C and timing simulation in HDL for antivirus applications. The simulation shows that the throughput of scanning Windows executable files for more than 10000 virus signatures can achieve 5.64 Gb/s, while the worst-case performance is 1.2 Gb/s if the signatures are properly specified.","1063-8210;10638210","","10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2012011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840440","Algorithms;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);string matching","","C language;digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;logic design;program verification;string matching","Bloom filter;C language;HDL;algorithmic heuristics;antivirus application;bad-block heuristic;behavior simulation;field programmable gate array;hardware accelerator;linear worst-case time method;network security;nonblocking interface;parallel query;sublinear time string-matching algorithm;timing simulation;verification module;virus signature","","8","","39","","20090424","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

This research proposes to assess different models of the usage of static and mobile agents to determine the best route through ad-hoc networks. The determination of this route is a complex one, and requires research into the best metrics to identify the best path, such as memory capacity, network performance, processing capabilities, cost, and so on. One model is to use a mixture of mobile and static agents to gather relevant information. These agents could perform important tests, which could be used to generate the best route through a network. This research looks at different models for the deployment of these agents, which balance the usage of static and mobile agents.

Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.","","","10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468","","Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN","","","","9","","16","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the researches done in the attack trace-back algorithms, the aim of this architecture is not only to determine the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) servers used to control the Botnet. But also to remove the bots from the infected machines and to revel the Botmaster identity This architecture is composed of a DDoS attacks detection agents*, spy agents* and a central agent* that coordinates between the other agents during the attack trace-back process.

Rana","Alcatel-Lucent Common Platform Development Department in Naperville, Illinois","Bell Labs Technical Journal","","2011","15","4","169","187","As the deployment of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) accelerates, there is an accompanying need to secure the SIP infrastructure. One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089;10897089","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","1","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

In this paper, the design of a new AIS algorithm and classifier system called simple AIS is described. It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier. This approach ensures global optimization of the whole system, and in addition, no population control mechanism is needed.

In this paper we propose a solution which addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key distribution to allow scalable data sharing. Our scheme uses strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities (e.g., switches, routers or other network elements), thereby removing bottlenecks at the disks and causing minimal inconvenience to the hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose efficient group key mechanisms that do not involve any centralized key distribution servers. This allows our scheme to be scalable and be free from any single point of failure or attack.","","","10.1109/SISW.2002.1183514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183514","","Availability;Cities and towns;Cryptography;Data security;Network servers;Power system security;Scalability;Secure storage;Storage area networks;Web server","cryptography;data integrity;data privacy;distributed databases;network operating systems","SAN entities;cryptographic processing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;distributed storage system;group key agreement;group key mechanisms;reliability;scalability;scalable data sharing;storage area networks;strong cryptographic techniques","","3","1","30","","","11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs.

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, etc.). This paper introduces proactive threat observatory system (PROTOS), an open-source early warning system that does not require a commercial license and is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet. The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370;12292370","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings. 15th International Conference on","","2001","","","253","258","As coordinated attacks on networks become more frequent, the study of systems that can identify unlawful attempts to penetrate a network, or so called intrusion detection systems (IDS), has become increasingly popular. IDS traditionally suffer from an inability to detect an attack that is built from a sequence of valid network activity. For this reason it is important to develop a system capable of analyzing the global nature of the network activity. One such system is GrIDS-a graph based intrusion detection system for large networks, being developed at the University of California, Davis, California. This system constructs graphs based on the network activity and then detects attacks based on an analysis of the characteristics of these graphs. One of the bottlenecks in this process is the inability to efficiently compare characteristics of very large networks. This often becomes necessary because the increasing complex nature of network traffic generates graphs with multiple nodes and edges. We propose using a new result on subgraph isomorphism due to Eppstein (see Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, vol.3, no.3, p.1-27, 1999) to maximize the efficiency of this analysis. This provides the IDS with the ability to analyze traffic on a broader level and thus increases the overall performance of the system","","","10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905436","","Authorization;Computer industry;Computer network reliability;Explosives;Information security;Intelligent networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;graph theory;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","GrIDS;Internet security;University of California;coordinated network attacks;graph based intrusion detection system;graphical techniques;large networks;network characteristics;network traffic analysis;subgraph isomorphism;system performance;valid network activity","","1","3","6","","","2001","31 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole.

Thus, a need exists to formulate effective and efficient security measures that safeguard these applications impacted from attack in the sensor cloud. However, analyzing the impact of different attacks and their causeconsequence relationship is a prerequisite before security measures can be either developed or deployed. In this paper, we propose a risk assessment framework for WSNs in a sensor cloud that utilizes attack graphs. We use Bayesian networks to not only assess but also to analyze attacks on WSNs. The risk assessment framework will first review the impact of attacks on a WSN and estimate reasonable time frames that predict the degradation of WSN security parameters like confidentiality, integrity and availability. Using our proposed risk assessment framework allows the security administrator to better understand the threats present and take necessary actions against them. The framework is validated by comparing the assessment results with that of the results obtained from different simulated attack scenarios.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2544307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437478","Attack graphs;bayesian networks;risk assessment;security;sensor clouds;wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;Cloud computing;Clouds;Estimation;Risk management;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","20160321","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To tackle this issue, we propose a distributed, signature-based anomaly detector that evaluates the trustworthiness of others so as to secure such a distributed detection. Contrary to existing detectors that passively observe packets, our detector analyses logs so as to identify patterns of misuse and proactively collaborate with others to gather additional evidences. As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on second-hands evidences that may come from colluding attacker (s).

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid intrusion detection system by using accelerated genetic algorithm and rough set theory (AGAAR) for data feature reduction, and genetic programming with local search (GPLS) for data classification. The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current. The results shown later indicate that classification accuracy improved from 75.98% to 81.44% after using AGAAR attribute reduction for the NSL-KDD dataset. The classification accuracies have been compared with others algorithms and shown that the proposed method can be one of the competitive classifiers for IDS.","","","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176208","Data Classification;Genetic Algorithm;Genetic Programming;Intrusion Detection Systems","Acceleration;Accuracy;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Search problems;Set theory","evolutionary computation;pattern classification;rough set theory;security of data","AGAAR;GPLS;IDS;NSL-KDD dataset;accelerated genetic algorithm and rough set theory;attack behaviors;data classification;data feature reduction;genetic programming operators;genetic programming with local search;hybrid evolutionary algorithms;hybrid intrusion detection system;intrusion detection dataset;malicious behaviors","","0","","22","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511;15253511","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","8","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed.

As cloud systems re-innovate ways of request distribution and load balancing, it is important to test these systems against attacks such as the denial of service attack. There is a strong emphasis on researching these attacks since cloud computing is re-inventing the payment systems in which consumers utilize resources.

"QoSE: Quality of security a network security framework with distributed NFV","T. Park; Y. Kim; J. Park; H. Suh; B. Hong; S. Shin","School of Computing, KAIST, Republic of Korea","2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","","2016","","","1","6","An effort to deploy security devices by the network provider has been increasing as the network is being exposed to various types of network attacks. However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node.

"An Efficient Task Allocation Protocol for P2P Multi-agent Systems","D. Ye; Q. Bai; M. Zhang; K. T. Win; Z. Shen","Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Software Eng., Univ. of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia","2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","","2009","","","11","18","Recently, task allocation in multi-agent systems has been investigated by many researchers. Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.","2158-9178;21589178","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966","","Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness","multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment","","1","","16","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a new architecture which is composed of distributed agents and honeypot. The main focus of our approach lies in reducing the false alarm rate of the attack detection. Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction. This action is hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. In this paper the architecture of the proposed system is described, a theoretical analysis of its behavior is given and its possible extension and implementation are explained.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/AINA.2008.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4482815","","Application software;Computer architecture;Data analysis;Databases;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Pattern analysis;Time series analysis;Yarn","distributed processing;security of data","attack detection;distributed agent;false alarm rate;false alarm ratio;firewall;honeypot network;intrusion detection system","","3","","12","","","25-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing (SUTC'06)","","2006","1","","8 pp.","","Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for collecting critical data in various applications. Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (""invariants""). These invariants are associated with conditions (the ""observed variables"") of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network. We construct a prototype to demonstrate the benefit of run-time detection and correction","","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636206","","Aggregates;Application software;Bandwidth;Error correction;Face detection;Fault detection;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Runtime;Wireless sensor networks","computer debugging;error correction;error detection;fault diagnosis;protocols;system recovery;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","H-SEND;fault diagnosis;hierarchical sensor network debugging;observation channel;protocol;semiautomatic approach;software error detection;wireless network","","4","","31","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is largely due to the integration of complex large data transfers across multiple zones of systems and network integration. The increase in transmission of highly sensitive data and challenges of data protection and of privacy, data loss prevention has major significant implications for systems engineering, systems integration, and systems analysis, design and validation. Furthermore, the design and development of complex integrated systems engineering and network systems lack effective transparency, auditability, validation and implementation of adequate security measures for transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks using third party and outsourced networks and the Internet and global privacy regulatory requirements for such data transfer across international borders. The major problem with current state of art approaches of controls for global critical infrastructures of virtual private networks (VPN) depend on inadequate third-party systems. Thus current approaches lack transparency, auditability and validation of the implementation of adequate privacy and security controls for data transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks. The additional problem of obscurity has resulted in increasing concealing of unauthorized access, identity thefts, privacy and security breaches of highly sensitive data, interception through the man-in-the-middle and intermediary systems.

This paper deals with design consideration of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on the Hadoop framework and acceleration of its performance by using General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU). The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings. Analytics over intrusion is done by using a Score-Weight approach called as Pattern Frequency Inverse Cluster Frequency (PF-ICF).

The complexity of the method to analyze these relationships, the time to complete the analysis, the robustness and trustworthiness of the method are important features to be considered. In this paper, we propose using Extended Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (E-FCMs) to analyze the relationships between risk factors and risks, and adopting a pessimistic approach to assess the overall risk of a system or a project. E-FCMs are suggested by Hagiwara to represent causal relationships more naturally. The main differences between E-FCMs and conventional Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are the following: E-FCMs have nonlinear membership functions, conditional weights, and time delay weights. Therefore E-FCMs are suitable for risk analysis as all features of E-FCMs are more informative and can fit the needs of Risk Analysis. In this paper we suggest a framework to analyze risks using E-FCMs and extend E-FCMs themselves by introducing a special graphical representation for risk analysis. We also suggest a framework for group decision making using E-FCMs. Particularly, we explore the Software Project Management (SPM) and discuss risk analysis of SPM applying E-FCMs.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2011.2134730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5756213","Fuzzy cognitive maps;project management;risk analysis","Decision making;Delay effects;Fuzzy cognitive maps;Random access memory;Risk analysis;Software;Taxonomy","decision making;risk analysis;software management","extended fuzzy cognitive maps;group decision making;risk analysis graphical representation;risk impact factor analysis;risk management;software project management","","15","","31","","20110425","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Moreover, their constantly changing topology causes network node density and neighbor relationships to change dynamically. This paper presents an intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs at the application layer. The IDS utilizes (1) both anomaly and misuse detection schemes to identify attacks in MANETs and (2) mobile agents (MAs) to augment each node's intrusion-detection capability. In particular, each node is equipped with a local IDS, and MAs will be dispatched periodically or on-demand to augment each node's IDS. We present the design of this IDS and the overall network structure, as well as the methods for authenticating and dispatching MAs. We also evaluate the trade-offs between different design parameters of MAs.","1530-1605;15301605","","10.1109/HICSS.2010.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428421","","Broadcasting;Communication system security;Dispatching;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Radio link;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;mobile computing;mobile radio;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","IDS;MA authentication;MA dispatch;MANET security;anomaly detection scheme;application-layer intrusion detection;changing topology;internode communications;intrusion-detection capability;misuse detection scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile agents;network node density;node mobility","","0","","13","","","5-8 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","13","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inst., Waseda Univ., Tokyo, Japan","16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","","2014","","","223","232","The MANETs have been experiencing exponential growth in the past decade. However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.","1738-9445;17389445","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177","Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In each stage, parallel SRAMs are used to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Transition rules can be efficiently stored and accessed in one cycle. The memory cost is less than 47% of the best known AC-based methods. P2-AC supports incremental update and scales well with the increasing number of strings.

Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion.

Increased uncertainty and complexity will increase the costs of malicious probing and attack efforts and thus prevent or limit network intrusion. As MTD increases complexity of the system for the attacker, the MTD also increases complexity in the desired operation of the system. This introduced complexity results in more difficult network troubleshooting and can cause network degradation or longer network outages. In this research paper the authors describe the defensive work factor concept. Defensive work factors considers in detail the specific impact that the MTD approach has on computing resources and network resources.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by ""licit"" and ""illicit"" network applications. The evaluation of the proposed methodology relies on traffic traces obtained in a controlled environment and composed by licit traffic measured from normal activity of network applications and malicious traffic synthetically generated using the subseven backdoor. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is able to achieve good identification results, being at the same time computationally efficient and easy to deploy in real network scenarios.","","","10.1109/ICIMP.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076342","Zombie;botnet;illicit traffic;neural network","Communication system traffic control;Electronic mail;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Neural networks;Personal communication networks;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;invasive software;local area networks;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","corporate Internet security;historical traffic profiles;illicit network application;licit network application;local area network;malicious software;neural networks;personal Internet security;subseven backdoor;zombie PC;zombie detection","","5","","21","","","24-28 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we explore the capabilities of DBN's performing intrusion detection through series of experiments after training it with NSL-KDD dataset. The trained DBN network now identifies any kind of unknown attack in dataset supplied to it and to the best of our knowledge this is first comprehensive paper performing intrusion detection using deep belief nets. The proposed system not only detect attacks but also classify them in five groups with the accuracy of identifying and classifying network activity based on limited, incomplete, and nonlinear data sources.

In general a DCS consists of many heterogenous components and agents including sensors, actuators, and controllers. Due to its distributed nature, some agents may start misbehaving to disrupt the system. This paper first reviews necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic detection of integrity attacks carried out by any number of malicious agents, based on the concept of left invertibility of structural control systems. It then develops a notion equivalent to structural left invertibility in terms of vertex separators of a graph, which allows a designer to efficiently determine if a network is perfectly attackable. This tool is then leveraged to design minimal communication networks for DCSs, which ensure that an adversary cannot generate undetectable attacks. Numerical examples are included to illustrate these results.","","CD:978-1-4673-8680-7; Electronic:978-1-4673-8682-1; POD:978-1-4673-8683-8","10.1109/ACC.2016.7525076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7525076","","Decentralized control;Detectors;Observers;Particle separators;Sensor systems","control system analysis;control system synthesis;distributed control;graph theory","DCS analysis;DCS design;communication network design;distributed control system;graph theoretic characterization;graph vertex separator;integrity attack detection;perfect attackability","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we achieve high operating frequencies by (iii) using ne grain pipelining for faster circuits and (iv) decoupling the data distribution network from the processing components. Our results show that for matching more than 18,000 characters (the entire SNORT rule set) our implementation requires an area cost of less than 1.1 logic cells per matched character, achieving an operating frequency of about 375 MHz (3 Gbps) on a Virtex2 device.

A common solution is to close the performance gap through hardware implementation of security functions. However, continuously expanding signature databases have become a major impediment to achieving scalable hardware based pattern matching. Additionally, evolutionary rule databases have necessitated real time online updating for reconfigurable hardware implementations. Based on the observation that signature patterns are constructed from combinations of a limited number of primary patterns, we propose to decompose the Snort signature patterns. These smaller primary pattern sets can be stored along with their associations to allow dynamic signature pattern reconstruction. Not only does the matching operation potentially become more scalable, but the real time online updating task is simplified. The approach is verified with patterns from the latest version of the Snort rule database. The experimental results show that after decomposition, a reduction in size of over 77% can be achieved on Snort signature patterns.","","","10.1109/DRCN.2009.5339986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339986","Decompose;FPGAs;Finite State Machine;Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS);Scalability;Security","Decision support systems;Hardware;Virtual reality","digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;reconfigurable architectures","FPGA;Snort rule database;Snort signature pattern;dynamic signature pattern reconstruction;evolutionary rule database;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching;reconfigurable hardware;security software;signature database","","2","","18","","","25-28 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","","2002","2","","1503","1508 vol.2","Traditional intrusion detection systems can be broadly classified as misuse and anomaly detectors. Misuse detectors attempt detection by matching the current system/user activity against known signatures and patterns. As opposed to this, anomaly detection works by developing a reference graph and comparing the ongoing activity against it. Any significant deviation is flagged as an intrusion. Anomaly detection is more promising because of its potential to detect unseen types of attacks. However, both techniques have conventionally relied on audit trails sampled deep inside the system via probes and the sheer size of the data allows only after-the-fact and off line detection. In recent past, there have been efforts to capture the semantics of system activity for more rapid detection and this can typically be done at levels closer to the user. In our earlier works related to this effort, we presented a scheme and a reasoning framework to detect intrusions based on the encapsulated user intent. This paper addresses the scalability and implementation aspects of the system by introducing concepts such as workspaces and meta-operations. Although this security system is a general anomaly detection system, it is amenable to operator fault recovery. While encryption provides secure communication channels, it leaves the end points exposed. Our security system has the additional capability of handling insider attacks relevant in this context.","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179706","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Context;Cryptography;Detectors;Fault detection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Probes;Scalability","computer network management;graphs;military communication;military computing;telecommunication security","encapsulated user intent;exposed end points;insider attacks;meta-operations;operator fault recovery;reasoning framework;reference graph;scalable implementation;user level anomaly detection system;workspaces","","3","","31","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed solution does not belong to any of the existing intrusion detection approaches, since it relies on a set of robust, self-contained Random Walk Detectors (RWDs), which may freely move from node to node and randomly traverse a network, while monitoring each visiting node for malicious behaviour. RWDs exhibit a number of benefits including locality, simplicity, low overhead, and robustness to changes in topology.

TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route. Using analysis and simulation results, we show that the TUF architecture is effective in thwarting a wide range of attacks, including protocol-compliant (also known as ""JellyFish"") attacks.","1930-529X;1930529X","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150899","","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer security;Cryptography;Information security;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Snow;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;TUF architecture;cross-layer technique;goodput monitoring;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer;protocol-compliant attacks;route rebuilding process;routing disruption denial-of-service attacks;secure routing architecture;throughput-feedback routing;transport layer","","2","","20","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6449406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services","","","","5","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

But network intrusions are now becoming more and more sophisticated to detect, thus, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been proposed which enables an IDS to collect information and learn experience from other IDS nodes. By maintaining interactions among a set of IDS nodes, a CIDN is expected to be more powerful in detecting some complicated attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) than a single IDS. In real deployment, we identify that each IDS may have different levels of sensitivity in detecting different types of intrusions (i.e., based on their own signatures and settings). In this paper, we therefore define a notion of intrusion sensitivity and investigate the feasibility of using it to evaluate the trustworthiness of an IDS node. In addition, we describe several challenges when using this notion in practice. In the evaluation, the experimental results indicate that the use of intrusion sensitivity is feasible and encouraging to enhance the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes.","","","10.1109/CIS.2013.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746483","Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Sensitivity;Trust Management","Accuracy;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Robustness;Sensitivity","computer crime;groupware;trusted computing","CIDN;DoS attack;IDS nodes;attacks identification;collaborative intrusion detection networks;denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection systems;intrusion sensitivity;malicious nodes detection;trust evaluation;trustworthiness","","1","","24","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These elements take advantage of complementary views and information availability on both the data and control planes. Moreover, they collaboratively look for network flooding attack signature constituents that possess different characteristics in the level of information abstraction. Therefore, this approach is able to not only quickly raise an alert against potential threats, but also follow it up with careful verification to reduce false alarms.

A large number of messages are exchanged for key establishment at startup and every time a node join or leave the group to refresh keys. These operations incur huge computation and communication cost that reduces the network life time. To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations. XKFS only requires a light weight message from a more powerful head node and thus eliminates the inter node communication cost. The performance of the XKFS is validated through simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the performance supremacy of XKFS over contemporary schemes in terms of minimizing key freshness operations and energy consumption.","","","10.1109/ITNG.2015.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113467","Energy efficiency;Key freshness;Key management;Secure group communication;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;electronic messaging;private key cryptography;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","XKFS;energy consumption minimization;huge communication cost;huge computation cost;left shift operations;lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme;magic word;message exchange;message transmission;resource constrained WSN;secret key establishment;wireless sensor network life time","","1","","17","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And faults of the sensing value are common due to the artificial attacker and the lack of physical protection. Therefore, we propose a key management and distributed abnormal area scanning scheme using spatial, temporal correlation and in-network aggregation for secure UPC.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes.

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware. We also evaluate them in terms of performance and the resources that they require.","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903487","Xen;cloud computing;forensics;introspection;intrusion detection;monitoring;security;virtual machine;virtualization","Forensics;Kernel;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital forensics;invasive software;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","FVM;Mini-OS virtualised operating system;Xen virtualisation platform;cloud defence;forensic virtual machines;guest virtual machines;image vulnerability;malicious activities;malicious behaviour discovery;malware","","5","","29","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, requirements for P2P architectures have to be expressed in notions of network engineering, because these architectures rank from the application layer to the IP networklayer. Thus, engineering P2P systems is a cross-disciplinary task between software and network engineers. We explain the ramifications P2P applications have on requirements of a given software engineering problem. A structured method supports software engineers in understanding the constraints of different kinds of P2P architectures and protocols on requirements.

We term this sort of DSN as a heterogeneous distributed sensor network (HDSN). Considering this scenario, we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator (OWA) which ensures that, before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other's legitimacy of membership. Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios. ModConTR is implemented using the NS2 simulator and is integrated with the DSR routing protocol.","2161-5322;21615322","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073179","DSR;NS2;ad hoc routing;comparative analysis;reputation;secure routing;trust","Ad hoc networks;Fading;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DSR routing protocol;Internet-of-things;ModConTR;NS2 simulator;ad-hoc networks;ad-hoc routing protocols;distributed wireless networks;identical attack scenarios;modular-and-configurable trust-and-reputation-based system;network connectivity;node interconnection;secure routing functionality","","1","","21","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing number of network security related incidents makes it necessary for organizations to actively protect their sensitive data with the installation of intrusion detection systems (IDS). Detecting intrusion in distributed network from outside network segment as well as from inside is a difficult problem. Intrusion detection system must analyze a large volume of data while not placing a significant added load on the monitoring systems and networks. The deficiency of centralized intrusion detection systems leads the idea of mobile agents. In an agent based IDS idea, there is no central station, therefore no central point of failure. Agents can detect and take predefined actions against malicious activity. The system shows a superior performance compared to central sniffing IDS techniques, and saves network resources compared to other distributed IDSs that activate too many sniffers causing bottlenecks in the network. This is one of the major motivations to use the distributed model based on mobile agent platform. This paper presents survey of distributed intrusion detection system based on mobile agents.

The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations.

Conventional GNP-based rule mining focused on binary-valued transaction data. Therefore, Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data. In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data. Then, a post-processing method is used to prune class association rules. After that, a classifier is modeled based on the multi-dimensional probability distribution for testing data.

The IP-based smart metering devices may exist with unknown vulnerabilities that can introduce backdoors to enable worm propagation across AMI network. The infected devices can be attack agents that would largely disable the metering functionalities or manipulate control variables of each meter. This paper proposes an optimal frequency of on-site investigation and the number of monitoring verification to investigate potential anomalies of malware footprinting by applying the decision process framework of Markovian. The proposed method determines the best inspection strategies based on the observation from the existing anomaly detectors deployed in the network.

The majority of the data-plane traffic is distributed via the switch's built-in traffic distribution function and no connection state is kept. If the load balancing controller detects a skew in the load of the DPP appliances, it updates the traffic rules in the switch to redirect new connections to less busy DPP appliances. This adaptive solution is beneficial for load-balancing at high data rates because state is kept for only the redirected connections. For typical traffic patterns, our solution reduces the packet drops with minimal connection redirection. We show an example capture, where we are able to improve the packet drop rate by 94.8% with only 3% of the connections being redirected.","1944-0367;19440367","","10.1109/LANMAN.2011.6076946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076946","","Clocks;Hardware;Home appliances;IP networks;Servers;Switches","local area networks;resource allocation","DPP;Ethernet switch;adaptive load balancing;data plane traffic;deep packet processing;high performing scaleout solution;load balancing controller;traffic distribution function","","0","","7","","","13-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a centralized controller, the process of updating networks becomes much more convenient when compared to traditional networks. However, even with SDNs, transitional network states during network updates may still cause problems. Such states may result in a breakdown of isolation guarantees or other critical constraints and this could lead to incorrect behavior or even security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel abstraction for network updates, inter-flow consistency, that can account for relationships and constraints among different flows during updates. We present a generic inter-flow consistency constraint, version isolation, and a special case, spatial isolation. We propose update scheduling algorithms based on dependency graphs and a data structure that captures dependencies among different update operations & network elements. We also implemented a prototype system on a Mininet OpenFlow network and Ryu SDN controller to evaluate our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is able to enforce inter-flow consistency constraints with reasonable overheads and that overheads for version isolation are higher than for spatial isolation. Furthermore, when only spatial isolation constraints are in use, overheads on update times for flows that have no isolation constraints are very small (around 1%).","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346859","","Bandwidth;Communication networks;Conferences;Packet loss;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security","centralised control;computer network security;data structures;graph theory;software defined networking;telecommunication control","Mininet OpenFlow network;Ryu SDN controller;SDN update abstraction;centralized controller;control planes;data planes;data structure;dependency graphs;inter-flow consistency;inter-flow constraints;network updates;security vulnerabilities;software defined networks;spatial isolation;transitional network;update scheduling algorithms;version isolation","","1","","21","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999).

Thus, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Hidden Markov Model based on Viterbi algorithm to detect distributed denial of service attacks in data communication networks.

Mesh client in our scheme only needs to prestore a key seed, which can be used to generate a column of secret matrix. It can establish pairwise keys with other clients after mesh routers broadcast public matrices. Our scheme is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. Besides, we employ the pre deployment knowledge to reduce the computational cost of mesh clients. Security and complexity analysis show that the new scheme possesses several desirable features: 1) neighbor mesh clients can directly establish pairwise keys; 2) the new scheme is updatable, scalable, and robust against node capture attacks; and 3) communication and storage costs at mesh clients are significantly reduced.","2168-6750;21686750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2287196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650019","Pairwise key;deployment knowledge;matrix;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","Computational efficiency;Computer security;Knowledge engineering;Symmetric matrices;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;matrix algebra;wireless mesh networks","WMN;complexity analysis;matrix-based pairwise key establishment scheme;mesh client;neighbor mesh clients;pre deployment knowledge;secret matrix;security analysis;wireless mesh networks","","1","","23","","20131030","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SACIN delivers the common operating picture through a brokered agent-based architecture.

A generic agent component is customized for each source system to produce events and allow JDL level 0 integration. Three different analysis components collect the events and produce meaningful objects, current state and future impact estimations in accordance with JDL levels 1 to 3. Brokered architecture allows level 4 control from various components, and JDL level 5 user interface is offered through a Web application. A prototype system has been developed to test and evaluate the SACIN framework. Apache ActiveMQ message broker was used to implement the brokered architecture, and other system components were implemented using Spring framework. The system architecture was tested using real-world data from intrusion detection system (IDS)-generated syslog and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system snapshot.

An information dissemination service is one of these applications. In this service, users can get local area information from an MA, which migrates from node to node within the local area. The system need not provide any server. Instead of servers, MAs collect local information and disseminate it. One of very important problems in such a service is to make MAs survive as long as possible in the service area. Several methods to manage mobile agents have been proposed. However, the migration algorithm for MA used in these studies is a simple one. In this paper, a new migration algorithm based on the predicted lifetime of MA is proposed.

"CompactDFA: Generic State Machine Compression for Scalable Pattern Matching","A. Bremler-Barr; D. Hay; Y. Koral","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya, Israel","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE","","2010","","","1","9","Pattern matching algorithms lie at the core of all contemporary Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), making it intrinsic to reduce their speed and memory requirements. This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X;0743166X","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","15","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2503399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360925","Bayesian network;cybersecurity;incident prediction;industrial control system (ICS);multiple models;risk assessment","Bayes methods;Computer crime;Control systems;Industrial control;Risk management","","","","","","","","20151218","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This type of computation falls under the category of Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). The solution to SMC problems in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) can be found with the modification of the data inputs or with some anonymization technique. MANETs are the wireless networks of the mobile computing devices with no support of any fixed infrastructure. The mobile nodes use any of the radio technology like Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 or Hiperlan for directly communicating with each other. The nodes behave as hosts as well as routers. The security challenges in the MANET arise due to its dynamic topology, vulnerable wireless link and nomadic environment. An identification mechanism is needed between the nodes using identification and the credentials. This security architecture simultaneously leads to privacy problems. Some mechanism is needed which prevents a node to learn the identity or the credentials of other nodes. To provide location privacy in MANET is a nontrivial task. Current routing protocols do not focus much on the security and the privacy issues. These aspects are postponed till further development. An authentication protocol is needed between nodes using some cryptographic technique. In service-oriented MANET the denial of the service must be taken care of so that the availability of the service is maintained. The security requirement of the ad hoc network depends on its application. For example, for a simple business meeting the requirement is mitigated and for the military battlefield it is severe. Thus no general security architecture can be developed for MANET. Specific security architecture is needed for specific application. Much security related work is still pending and will add to the standards as the physical deployment of the MANET will grow. In this paper, an empha- - sis is made on how SMC solutions can be used for privacy preservation during computation.","1811-3923;18113923","","10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587317","MANET;Privacy;Secure Multiparty Computation;Security","Ad hoc networks;Aggregates;Computational modeling;Irrigation;Mobile computing;Presses;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols","MANET;SMC;authentication protocol;cryptographic technique;distributed computing device;mobile ad hoc network;mobile computing devices;privacy preservation;secure multiparty computation;security architecture;wireless network","","6","","16","","","6-8 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Packet classification systems have traditionally been built utilizing Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) due to the high throughput needed. However, TCAMs are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. An alternative to TCAM based systems using SRAM and a novel rule encoding method has been proposed to match multiple packets simultaneously (using multiple store_compare_units). This alternative achieves similar or better throughput than the traditional TCAM approach while occupying smaller space and consuming less energy. This paper revamps the existing SRAM-based architecture to reduce area and power consumption without threatening throughput. Two methods are shown. The first method allows for range encoding SRAMs to be shared between store_compare_units (SCUs) to lower area and power consumption with minor effect on throughput. The second method discusses a hybrid system allowing rules with prefixes (single rules) and ranges (rules which match a range of addresses, usually translated to many prefixes) to exist in parallel for the same domain. This allows for lower power consumption than utilizing fixed range encoding due to optimization of the ruleset. Results show that this hybrid architecture saves more than 20% of power/field if half of the TCP ports contain ranges (and the other half contains prefixes). The new extensions have been tested in over ten benchmarks (including the SNORT ruleset) to verify the claimed improvements.","","","10.1109/NCA.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598235","LOP;Packet Classification;Range Encoding","Australia;Clocks;Encoding;Memory management;Power demand;Random access memory;Throughput","SRAM chips;computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching","SNORT ruleset;SRAM;TCP ports;packet classification system;range encoding;rule encoding;store compare units;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","24","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are extremely vulnerable to a variety of misbehaviors because of their basic features like: lack of communication infrastructure, dynamic network topology and short transmission range. To detect and reduce those misbehaviors, numerous trust management schemes have been proposed for MANETs. To effectively set up MANET, security is one of the main challenges that must be undertaken. The weight based clustering approach is based on combined weight metric that takes into account of several system parameters like the mobility, degree difference, transmission range and battery power of the node. One way to support efficient communication between nodes is to partition ad hoc networks into clusters. Various clustering schemes have been proposed to form clusters. Proposed IWCA algorithm can enhance the trust of cluster formation followed by malicious node removal from cluster head or member selection.","1811-3923;18113923","","10.1109/WOCN.2013.6616243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616243","malicious node;packet drop ratio;packet misroute rate;packet modified rate","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Wireless communication","fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology","IWCA;MANET;dynamic network topology;fault tolerance;improved weighted clustering algorithm;malicious node removal;mobile ad-hoc network;network resource lifetime;numerous trust management scheme;radio transmitter","","1","","22","","","26-28 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach has potential for comparative emotion recognition accuracy when coupled with MLP.","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836608","CMAC;EEG;emotion classification;feature extraction;latent features","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Training","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;self-organising feature maps;signal classification","CMAC;EEG signals;KDE;MFCC;MLP classifier;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;PSD;calm emotion;cerebellar model articulation controller;classification performance;computational cerebellar model;data-driven self-organizing feature map;emotion classification;emotion recognition accuracy;fear emotion;feature extraction;happiness emotion;kernel density estimation;multilayer perceptron classifier;power spectrum density;sadness emotion","","0","","28","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An SMM is expected to produce correct outcomes while scanning the input data at high rates. Furthermore the string sets that are searched for are usually large and their sizes increase steadily. Bloom Filters (BFs) are hashing data structures which are fast but their false positive results require further processing. That is, their speed can be exploited for Standard Bloom Filter SMMs (SBFs) as long as the positive probability is low. Multiple BFs in parallel can further increase the throughput. In this paper, we propose the Double Bloom Filter SMM (DBF) which achieves a higher throughput than the SBF and maintains a high throughput even for large positive probabilities. The second Bloom Filter of DBF stores a small enough subset of the positive strings such that its false positive probability is approximately zero. We develop an analytical model of the DBF and show that the throughput advantage of DBF over SBF becomes more prominent if the positive probability and the fraction of matches in the second Bloom Filter increase. Accordingly, we propose a heuristic algorithm that stores the strings that are more frequently matched in the second Bloom Filter according to localities identified in the input. Our numerical results are obtained using realistic values from an FPGA implementation and are validated by SystemC simulations.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2577033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485864","Bloom filter;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate array (FPGA);string matching","Analytical models;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Matched filters;Metadata;Throughput;Time factors","","","","","","","","20160606","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Hence, it is not really an overstatement to say that `all models are wrong'. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics loop for supporting the continuous development of models during their deployment. We describe the roles of three types of operators (monitors, analysts and modelers), present the visualization techniques used at different stages of model development, and demonstrate the utility of this approach in conjunction with a prototype software system for corporate insider threat detection.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","1","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method uses promiscuous mode of working along with rating and collaborative decision making based on multiple threshold values. All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection.

The existing data fusion systems rely generally on human experts but they lack of training dataset for the fusion techniques. Thus, useful autonomous approach should be applied to fuse data automatically and accurately. In this paper, a decision fusion approach based on clustering technique is proposed. This technique enables the generation of composite attack scenarios by selecting events generated by analyzers while considering their efficiency to detect attacks using defined efficiency criteria.

It also provides a set of conversion rules that transform the gates of fault trees into statechart notations. The resultant model shows how the system behaves when a failure condition occurs and acts as a basis model that ensures safety through requirement validation.

Hence, the distributed NIDS architecture must be combined with adequate mechanisms for dynamic load redistribution. In this paper, we propose and compare different policies for the activation/deactivation of the dynamic load balancer. In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models.

A plethora of technologies exists, that individually represent a (potentially) effective building block of a real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility, but - regrettably - they very much lack integration. We claim that a significant advancement in the convergence of such technologies is needed. While recently some achievements have been made, much is yet to be done. In this paper, we briefly review the current State Of The Art (SOTA) of technologies that can be used to implement a real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility, with two objectives: 1) perform a gap analysis, i.e. point out the major limitations of such technologies, and 2) identify the main avenues towards effective SEC&DEP monitoring.","1071-6572;10716572","","10.1109/CCST.2014.6987018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987018","Event Collection;Event Correlation;Fault and Intrusion Tolerance;Real-time monitoring","Business;Correlation;Monitoring;Random access memory;Real-time systems;Security;Sensors","fault tolerant computing;security of data","building block;monitoring process;real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility;real-time security & dependability monitoring","","0","","24","","","13-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection. However, unless the scalability problem of complex data models taking into account the ordering property of activity data is solved, intrusion detection techniques based on the frequency property provide a viable solution that produces good intrusion detection performance with low computational overhead","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/3468.935043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935043","","Computer bugs;Decision trees;Frequency;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Pattern recognition;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","Markov processes;auditing;decision trees;information systems;probability;security of data","Hotelling T<sup>2</sup> test;Markov chain;activity data;chi-square multivariate test;complex data models;computer audit data;decision tree;event sequence;frequency property;information system;intrusion detection;low computational overhead;multiple audit event types;probabilistic techniques","","76","12","57","","","Jul 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in identifying a wide range of anomalies.

The shared files are generally both large and copyrighted. Motivated by the problems of UlakNet with the P2P traffic, we propose a novel method for P2P traffic-detection in the network backbone in this paper. Observing the similarity between detecting traffic that belongs to a specific protocol and detecting an intrusion in a computer system, we adopt an intrusion detection system (IDS) technique to detect P2P traffic. Our method is a passive detection procedure that uses traffic flows gathered from border routers.

This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets.

The AMCS algorithm uses an improved representation for antigens (corresponding to network access patterns) and detectors (corresponding to detection rules). In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity.

Thus, a high-performance signature matching scheme is of great importance for a signature-based IDS. In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

For the security perspective, communication between mobile nodes via wireless links make these networks more susceptible to internal or external attacks because any one can join and move the network at any time. In general, Packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s) is one of the possible attack in the mobile ad hoc network.

Univ., China","Proceedings 20th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","","2006","","","8 pp.","","Selective forwarding attacks may corrupt some mission-critical applications such as military surveillance and forest fire monitoring. In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks. The simulation results show that even when the channel error rate is 15%, simulating very harsh radio conditions, the detection accuracy of the proposed scheme is over 95%.","1530-2075;15302075","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639675","","Application software;Base stations;Computer science;Error analysis;Fires;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Routing protocols;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","mission-critical application;multihop acknowledgement;security scheme;selective forwarding attacks detection;sensitive packet;wireless sensor network","","22","1","20","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported.

The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299","Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM)","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Feedback;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Predictive models;Protection","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automatically tuning intrusion detection system;computer system;data-mining;dynamically changing environment;information systems;machine learning techniques;security experts knowledge;security layer;system operators","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","30","2","28","","","April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, most works pointed out their inefficiency in detecting novel attacks. In this paper, we address the inadequacy of decision trees for behavioral anomaly detection. We first explain why decision trees fail in detecting most of novel attacks. In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","6","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks do not use any predefined infrastructure during the communication so that all the present mobile nodes which are want to communicate with each other immediately form the topology and initiates the request for data packets to send or receive. In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s). This paper developed an anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system to detect the packet dropping attack from mobile ad hoc networks and this proposed solution also save the resources of mobile nodes in respect to remove the malicious nodes. For implementation point of view, qualnet simulator 6.1 and sugeno-type fuzzy inference system are used to make the fuzzy rule base for analyzing the results. From the simulation results it's proved that proposed system is more capable to detect the packet dropping attack with high positive rate and low false positive under each level (low, medium and high) of speed of mobile nodes.","","","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779330","MANETs security issues;detection methods;fuzzy logic;intrusion detection system (IDS);mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);packet dropping attack","Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes","fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system;data packets;fuzzy rule base;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;network topology;packet dropping attack;qualnet simulator 6.1;sugeno-type fuzzy inference system;wireless communication","","3","","16","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Understanding transactional memory performance","D. E. Porter; E. Witchel","The University of Texas at Austin, USA","Performance Analysis of Systems & Software (ISPASS), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on","","2010","","","97","108","Transactional memory promises to generalize transactional programming to mainstream languages and data structures. The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","3","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Now the research is going on On-Line Updates for local agents and global agents individually in high data rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), when the network has maximum mobility and maximum data rate.","2325-6001;23256001","","10.1109/ICCCA.2012.6179178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179178","Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes;Intrusion Detection;Key management;Wireless Sensor Networks","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Noise measurement;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","error statistics;protocols;self-adjusting systems;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DYDOG;WSN;data flow;dynamic intrusion detection node;dynamic intrusion detection protocol model;global agent;high error rate wireless sensor network;intrusion monitoring node;local agent;maximum data rate;maximum mobility;network attack;one-hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;physical environment;secure session key management;self-organizing sensor node;two hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;wireless environment","","3","","11","","","22-24 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposal, the IBW Framework, includes an approach for security in WMN detecting and mitigating the attacks through the use of non-relational databases for the data correlation and the dissemination of intrusion information among the nodes in WMN to reduce the amount of attacks in short time. Data correlation is done from the log data of servers and distributed Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDSs & IPSs) using syslog information with a particular format.

GNP is a graph-based evolutionary algorithm and can extract many important class association rules by making use of the distinguished representation ability of the graph structures. In this paper, a probabilistic classification is proposed and combined with the class association rule mining of GNP, and applied to Network intrusion detection for the performance evaluation. The proposed method creates a joint probability density function of normal and intrusion accesses and use it to efficiently classify new access data into normal, known intrusion or unknown intrusion.

Many ad hoc network routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. However, none of them deal with the issues of security. The presence of malicious nodes in an ad hoc network deteriorates the network performance. A novel approach for enhanced intrusion detection system for malicious node is proposed here to protect against attacks in ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol. The proposed approach employs a method for determining conditions under which malicious node should be monitored. Apart from identification of malicious node, it has been observed that this approach leads to less conservation and less communication breakage in ad hoc routing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively detect malicious nodes. This approach has been found beneficial for identifying malicious nodes in black hole attack, neighbour attack, sequence number attack and packet forwarding attack up to 700 nodes.","1751-8628;17518628","","10.1049/iet-com.2009.0616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645737","","","ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;black hole attack;cooperative wireless nodes;intrusion detection system enhancement;malicious node detection;minimal energy consumption;neighbour attack;packet forwarding attack;sequence number attack","","4","","","","","November 26 2010","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The central database to which the agents report warehouses and analyzes the meta-information collected by the interconnected agents.

Eng., Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","","2014","59","12","3224","3237","Networked control systems consist of distributed sensors and actuators that communicate via a wireless network. The use of an open wireless medium and unattended deployment leaves these systems vulnerable to intelligent adversaries whose goal is to disrupt the system performance. In this paper, we study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary establishes a link between two geographically distant regions of the network by using either high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing constraints of real-time control systems by first creating low-latency links, which attract network traffic, and then delaying or dropping packets. Since the wormhole attack reroutes and replays valid messages, it cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling and mitigating the wormhole attack. We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. By integrating existing mitigation strategies into our framework, we analyze the throughput, delay, and stability properties of the overall system. Through simulation study, we show that, by selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the physical system.","0018-9286;00189286","","10.1109/TAC.2014.2351871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882790","Cyber-physical systems;networked control systems;passivity;wireless networks;wormhole attack","Cryptography;Delays;Networked control systems;Resource management;Routing;Silicon","computer network security;cryptography;delays;networked control systems;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","cryptographic mechanisms;delay constraints;network flows;network traffic;networked control systems;packet delays;passivity framework;wireless network;wormhole attacks","","4","","19","","20140828","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV. This implies that we have achieved added security with less additional cost to the system.","","","10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983282","Performance;SAODV;routing attacks on AODV","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocols;MANET;SAODV routing protocols;asymmetric key cryptography;exchanged control messages;network routing attacks;secure routing;temporal time stamping;vulnerability assessment","","1","3","18","","","20-22 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","4","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","2","","34","","20130404","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements.

In this paper, the Effective Privacy Protection Scheme (EPPS) is proposed to provide the appropriate privacy protection which is satisfying the user-demand privacy requirement and maintaining system performance simultaneously. At first, we analyze the privacy level users require and quantify security degree and performance of encryption algorithms. Then, an appropriate security composition is derived by the results of analysis and quantified data. Finally, the simulation results show that the EPPS not only fulfills the user-demand privacy but also maintains the cloud system performance in different cloud environments.

We propose an effective blacklist URL generation method. We try to discover the URLs in the neighborhood of a malicious URL by using a search engine. Those suspicious neighborhoods around malicious URLs require further investigation to determine their blacklisting candidacy.

Moreover, smart grid Systems are considered critical systems requiring reliable and real time data delivery and an efficient, flexible, scalable control solution to satisfy the system requirements. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a new architecture model for smart grid networks based on the Software Defined Systems (SDSys) paradigm. The main idea behind the SDSys revolves around abstracting the control plane out of the data plane and setting it at a separate layer in the middleware. Different forms of SDSys like Software Defined Network (SDN), Software Defined Storage (SDStore), Software Defined Security (SDSec) and Software Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT) are used to provide a comprehensive smart grid control solution which hide the complexity that exists in traditional control techniques. Meanwhile, we show how the proposed model can provide an accurate, reliable, secure, extensible and network-aware architecture design for smart grid network. Furthermore, we explain how it can provide a single point of view for all smart grid resources and a programmable interface to adapt the network for any sudden changes.","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507269","","Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Internet of things;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Software","Internet of Things;middleware;power engineering computing;smart power grids;software defined networking","SDIoT;SDN;SDSec;SDStore;SDSys;middleware;smart grid networks;software defined Internet of Things;software defined based smart grid architecture;software defined security;software defined storage","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Integrated with SDN, the software-defined NFV architecture further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of NFV. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of NFV under the software-defined NFV architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application.

Besides, the landscape of digital threats and cyber-attacks is evolving tremendously, considering SDNs as a potential target to have even more devastating effects than using simple networks. Security is not considered as part of the initial SDN design; therefore, it must be raised on the agenda. This article discusses the state-of-the-art security solutions proposed to secure SDNs. We classify the security solutions in the literature by presenting a thematic taxonomy based on SDN layers/interfaces, security measures, simulation environments, and security objectives. Moreover, the article points out the possible attacks and threat vectors targeting different layers/interfaces of SDNs. The potential requirements and their key enablers for securing SDNs are also identified and presented. Also, the article gives great guidance for secure and dependable SDNs.

In this paper we consider the signature detection technique and investigate the ability of various routing protocols to facilitate intrusion detection when the attack signatures are completely known. We show that reactive ad-hoc routing protocols suffer from a serious problem due to which it might be difficult to detect intrusions even in the absence of mobility.

The technique has been tested through extensive simulation, and the result shows we can successfully track down the attacker with a reasonable size of bloom filter as long as the collision rate in the filter is kept down under 0.07%.","","","10.1109/ICCIT.2008.292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682299","Clustering;MANET;Security;Traceback","Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Information filtering;Information filters;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Testing","IP networks;ad hoc networks;filtering theory;mobile radio;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","mobile ad-hoc networks;noble logging technique;resource limitation problem;resource-efficient IP traceback technique;security;time-tagged bloom filter;topology-changing problem","","3","","17","","","11-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security threats could be one of the major stunning blocks on this evolution road. While system vendors and cloud tenants benefit much from sharing resources in the cloud environment, security breaches can cause more significant damages of the cloud ecosystem than personal computers. Virtualization techniques facilitate the movement of intrusion detection system to cloud-host operating systems with virtual machine management by observing behaviors of virtual machines (VMs). However, a VM-based detection system inherits the semantic gap problem: it is needed the ability to reveal (malicious) behaviors of VMs from observed data. We propose an automatic and systematic analysis framework for charactering malware behaviors using unsupervised clustering. This framework consists of three phases: (1) unsupervised clustering on behaviors of VMs, (2) supervised classification rule derivation, and (3) online system detection. Specifically, we collect and cluster system call distributions of VMs within a small period as samples, identify clusters that contain only samples from malicious VMs, and derive detection rules by extracting features of these malicious clusters. VMs that have been observed their system call distributions falling into a malicious cluster are considered to be malicious. We have integrated the presented framework with OpenStack and develop a prototype online monitoring system, called VISO. We conduct several experiments against common attacks, showing the effectiveness of VISO on clustering, classifying and detecting malicious behaviors of VMs.","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396135","cloud security;clustering;virtual machine introspection","Cloud computing;Feature extraction;Malware;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;feature extraction;invasive software;pattern classification;pattern clustering;virtual machines;virtualisation","OpenStack;VISO;VM-based detection system;cloud computing;cloud-host operating systems;intrusion detection system;malicious cluster feature extraction;malware behaviors;online system detection;prototype online monitoring system;security breaches;semantic gap problem;supervised classification rule derivation;unsupervised clustering;virtual machine malicious behaviors;virtualization techniques","","","","51","","","Nov. 30 2015-Dec. 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Outsourcing the data to a cloud in a multitenant environment brings many security challenges including data leaks, threats, and malicious attacks. The cloud computing platform, virtual servers, and the provider's services are highly dynamic and diverse in nature, making the traditional access control mechanisms (e.g., Firewalls and VLAN etc.) less effective in controlling the unauthorized access to cloud's data and resources. Several access control policies and authorization system have been proposed in literature to defend against cloud security threats. Most of these systems are designed to work with one or more access control policies. However, little work has been done to develop generic access control architecture capable to work with most of the available access control policies. In this paper, we present a new access control architecture using a global resource management system (GRMS) to effectively handle both local and remote access requests. The introduction of GRMS makes our proposed architecture semi distributed at the expense of minimal request-response time. In addition, our proposed architecture works effectively with both peered access control module (PACM) and virtual resource manager (VRM) to protect and manage all resources and services of cloud providers from unauthorized access.","2159-6182;21596182","","10.1109/CLOUD.2015.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214083","Access control;cloud computing;role based access control;side channel attack;virtual resource manager","Authorization;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Containers;Virtualization","authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;file servers;resource allocation","GRMS;PACM;VRM;access control mechanisms;authorization system;cloud computing;cloud environment security;cloud providers;cloud security threats;data leaks;generic access control architecture;global resource management system;malicious attacks;multitenant environment;peered access control module;privacy concerns;security challenges;security concerns;semidistributed access control management scheme;unauthorized access;virtual resource manager;virtual servers","","1","","17","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enhance security, various trust-based schemes have been proposed that augment traditional cryptography-based security schemes. However, most of them use static and predefined trust thresholds for node misbehavior detection, without taking into consideration the network conditions locally at each node. Using static thresholds for misbehavior detection may result in high false positives, low malicious node detection rate, and network partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Trust Threshold (ATT) computation strategy, that adapts the trust threshold in the routing protocol according to network conditions such as rate of link changes, node degree and connectivity, and average neighborhood trustworthiness. We identify the topology factors that affect the trust threshold at each node, and leverage them to build a mathematical model for ATT computation. Our simulation results indicate that the ATT strategy achieves significant improvements in packet delivery ratio, reduction in false positives, and increase in detection rate as compared to traditional static threshold strategies.","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345347","MANETs;Trust-based security;adaptive threshold;static threshold;threshold computation","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Measurement;Mobile computing;Network topology;Routing;Security","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","ATT computation strategy;MANETs;adaptive trust threshold strategy;cryptography-based security schemes;distributed architecture;dynamic network topology;high false positive reduction;low malicious node detection rate;mathematical model;misbehaving node detection;misbehaving node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;network partitioning;packet delivery ratio;predefined trust thresholds;routing protocol;static threshold strategy;trust-based schemes","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060942","Security;smart distirbution grid;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Network security;Physical layer;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","power distribution;power system security;safety systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks","SDG;WMN;backbone power network;intrusion detection;low cost high speed links;power transmission;response scheme;security framework;smart power distribution grid;smart tracking firewall;wireless communication network;wireless mesh networks;wireless networks","","56","","24","","20111025","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing. Experimental results demonstrate the cases in which the performance of AACK is either improved or degraded when the number of MNs changes.","","","10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7149666","","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data","AACK;IDS;MANETs;MNs;NS2;adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile nodes","","0","","15","","","26-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The connection is retrieved to the original destination in case of false alarm recognition, while the actions are hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. The second contribution applies the game theoretic analysis in the sense that the contributing agents are led to perform the best they could in order to achieve their goals. The Shaply value is computed to find the actual contribution of each agent in the coalition he belongs to. The equilibrium point is found and consequently the winner coalition is formed.

The reporting propagates from child to parent nodes until it reaches the root. A novel control message, distress propagation object (DPO), is devised to report the anomaly to the subsequent parents and ultimately the edge-router. The DPO message is integrated to routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL). The system has configurable profile settings and it is able to learn and differentiate the nodes' normal and suspicious activities without a need for prior knowledge. It has different subsystems and operation phases at data link and network layers, which share a common repository in a node.

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

In this paper, we present a protocol for detecting wormhole attacks without use of any special harware such as directional antenna and precise synchronised clock and the protocol is also independent of physical medium of wireless network. After the route discovery, source node initiates wormhole detection process in the established path which counts hop difference between the neighbours of the one hop away nodes in the route.

This paper presents a distributed framework and protocol, BANDS, for inter-domain policy negotiation and generation. The BANDS architecture consists of two phases: AS (autonomous system) route path discovery and an inter-domain collaborative protocol for policy negotiation among the autonomous systems discovered in the first phase. Each AS conceptually has one security requirement server responsible for the task of inter-domain policy negotiation. Following this two-step process in BANDS, a set of distributed security policies (for the implementation of policy enforcement) is automatically negotiated/generated based on decentralized and predefined security requirements.","","","10.1109/INM.2003.1194183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194183","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Data security;Home automation;Internet;Portable computers;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","Internet;business communication;computer network management;protocols;telecommunication security;virtual private networks","AS route path discovery;BANDS;IPSec policies;VPN;automated policy generation;autonomous system;collaborative protocol;corporate data;decentralized security requirements;distributed security policies;high-level security policies;inter-domain policy negotiation;security requirement server","","5","","11","","","24-28 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

To protect such archives, we propose a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

The NoC Firewall checks the physical address and rejects untrusted CPU requests to on-chip memory, thus protecting legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC from the injection of malicious instructions or data to shared memory. Based on a validated kernel-space Linux system driver of the NoC Firewall which is seen as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric, we develop higher-layer security services that focus on physical address protection based on a set of rules. While our primary scenario concentrates on monitors and actors related to protection from malicious (or corrupt) drivers, other interesting use cases related to healthcare ethics, are also put into the context.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7356985","Linux driver;NoC;firewall;multicore SoC","Field programmable gate arrays;Firewalls (computing);Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Registers","field programmable gate arrays;firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;Zedboard;Zynq 7020 FPGA;corrupt drivers;hardware NoC firewall module;healthcare ethics;high-level security services;malicious drivers;malicious instructions;multicore SoC;network-on-chip;on-chip memory;physical address protection;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;shared memory;untrusted CPU requests;validated kernel-space Linux system driver","","","","15","","","29-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While integrated GPUs, residing on the same die with the CPU, offer many advanced features such as on-chip interconnect CPU-GPU communication, and shared physical/virtual memory, their applicability for packet processing workloads has not been fully understood and exploited. In this paper, we conduct in-depth profiling and analysis to understand the integrated GPU's capabilities and performance potential for packet processing workloads. Based on that understanding, we introduce a GPU accelerated network packet processing framework that fully utilizes integrated GPU's massive parallel processing capability without the need for large numbers of packet batching, which might cause a significant processing delay. We implemented the proposed framework and evaluated the performance with several common, light-weight packet processing workloads on the Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> Processor E3-1200 v4 product family (codename Broadwell) with an integrated GT3e GPU.

The huge amount of logs generated by different assets in the network are not always capable to be correlated and reviewed to determine possible security breaches. We implemented a new reliable and scalable classification-based hybrid IPS that can easily manage the processing of all the authentication log information of different IPSs in the network. This enhanced framework can determine in a more precise manner if a communication can be considered legitimate or an intrusion. This classification method increases the intrusion detection rate and decreases the false positive rate.

Therefore, their design should include improved resilience capabilities to allow them to operate correctly in highly adverse environments. This paper proposes SieveQ, a message queue service that protects and regulates the access to critical systems, in a way similar to an application-level firewall. SieveQ achieves fault and intrusion tolerance by employing an architecture based on two filtering layers, enabling efficient removal of invalid messages at early stages and decreasing the costs associated with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication of previous solutions. Our experimental evaluation shows that SieveQ improves existing replicated-firewalls resilience in the presence of corrupted messages by faulty nodes. Furthermore, it accommodates high loads, as it is able to handle sixteen times more security events per second than what was processed by the SIEM employed in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2016.2593442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517292","Application-level firewall;BFT;Denial-of-service;Intrusion Tolerance","Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Protocols;Receivers;Resilience","","","","","","","","20160720","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. We use a novel partitioned TCAM technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for SNIC-based deployment.","1063-6404;10636404","","10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751855","","Aggregates;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Inspection;Internet;Network interfaces;Personal communication networks;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;content-addressable storage;network interfaces;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet edge device;NIC-based packet content inspection system;green computing;low-power sleep state;network interface card;network intrusion detection;network traffic;next generation smart NIC;power management feature;power proxying;resource-constrained processing;ternary content addressable memory","","4","","25","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much of the literature on fault-tolerant distributed systems focuses on local error recovery by masking the effects of faults. We describe a direction for error recovery in the face of catastrophic faults, where the effects of the faults cannot be masked using available resources.

That is useful for adapting security policy, analysis of vulnerabilities, and creation of reports that effectively communicate security vulnerability discoveries and detailed corrective actions to all levels of an organization. While vulnerability assessment is not a new technology, mobile agents offer many advantages to the traditional implementations. The most significant contribution is the increased ability for system administrators to quickly and easily add distributed components to existing systems that can look for newly published vulnerabilities. This paper suggests the vulnerability assessment through mobile agents where both network and host-based technologies in coordinated fashion using mobile agents will provide the best vulnerability assessment for measuring an organization's security risks. The mobile agent targets the intended host or network, captures, analyzes, and scans all vulnerabilities and reports to the master agent/server for comprehensive analysis and security assessment, and the master agent will act accordingly.

Valeur","Reliable Software Group, California Univ., Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual","","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information.

"A Distributed Hierarchical Policy Management System for Security Control over Tactical Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","K. Parmeswaran; B. Coan; J. Burns; P. Mouchtaris; S. W. Lucas","Telcordia Technologies","MILCOM 2007 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","","2007","","","1","9","Tactical mobile ad hoc wireless networks can provide flexibility, agility, and mobility for dynamic network-centric warfare. They are designed to function without fixed infrastructure support. But, this design makes network security attacks hard to detect and control. For instance, an attacker could compromise one portion of the network by inducing a worm and then move to another portion of the network and replay the attack without being detected. In this paper, we describe a policy management system (PMS) that provides ubiquitous and consistent security policy control despite adverse conditions such as node mobility, node failures, network partitions, a compromise of the routing infrastructure, a high packet loss rate, and ongoing cyber attacks. We give performance results in a 47-node emulated network. Key challenges in tactical networks include a lossy environment with bit error rates as high as 0.001 and bandwidth as low as 500Kbits/s. TCP backs off in the face of packet loss and hence behaves poorly in such networks. Tactical network are also subject to cyber attacks that have the potential even to compromise the routing infrastructure. Our PMS architecture mitigates these issues by using a transport protocol that has two components, one oriented toward normal operation when the routing infrastructure is functioning and one oriented toward limited, but robust, operation even when the routing infrastructure has been compromised. In normal operation we use a reliable UDP protocol (RUDP) and in times of compromise we use a flooding protocol.","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455069","","Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Computer security;Control systems;Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Transport protocols;Wireless networks","","","","3","","13","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, these networks demand much stronger security mechanisms than the traditional networks. It is hard to achieve security and robustness in the routing protocols at the same time in such networks. Several issues have to be understood and addressed before devising a security mechanism. This paper targets securing the reactive routing protocol AODV. The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes. And on the second level, the intrusion detection model (IDM) identifies the misbehaving nodes using the knowledge base and the response model (RM) isolates these nodes from the network.","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179629","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Environmental management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Network topology;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;data privacy;military communication;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;EADM;IDM;ad hoc networks;authentication;compromised nodes;confidentiality;dual level security model;external attack;external attack detection model;internal attack;intrusion detection model;knowledge base;malicious behavior;military communication;mutual trust;reactive routing protocol;response model;robustness;scalable security schemes","","2","","17","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.","1551-6245;15516245","","10.1109/MDM.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security","","14","","41","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, we assume that we are able to measure the number of transmissions occurring in the different parts of the network during the measurement periods. In this setting we study the problem of inferring the end-to-end traffic demands (traffic matrix) based on the available information. As this information is not sufficient we make some additional Poissonian assumptions on the nature of the traffic in order to have a well-defined problem with a unique solution.

The agent can be defined as a software entity which functions continuously and autonomously in a particular environment, able to carry out activities in a flexible and intelligent manner that is responsive to changes in the environment, and able to learn from its experience. An intrusion detection system can be decomposed into steps where an agent can perform a single or more step. But performance evaluation techniques of their use are still in the early stage. This infancy status holds especially true for agents used in intrusion detection systems (IDS) since they are new to this field. We believe that the two most important factors to measure for a given IDS are the risk time and the detection time. The risk time is the time at which the computer could be under risk of attack since the intrusion is not discovered yet. The smaller the detection time is the smaller the risk time.

This paper develops an energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism in WSNs called green firewall. It can isolate an intruder with less overhead, and track the intruder to continually prevent the attack.

The cloud service providers foresee it as a source of promising financial gains, the clients find it a convenient solution where the enterprises may get started on their computing activities without investing on the in-house facilities of hardware and software. They can outsource the computing and archiving activities to the cloud service providers (CSP) though Internet. There are many dimensions of these activities and the researchers are trying to find acceptable solutions for the industry. In this paper, we have focused on the information security issues when migrating to a cloud environment. The confidence of end user can be won partially by the guarantees of service provider and use of cryptographic techniques. It is important that the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) should be included in the models which support forensic study whenever required. It is equally important to address the issue of anti-forensic methods that the service providers may use to hide their malicious activities. Therefore the clients would like to have a better, in-depth knowledge of information management at service providers' end. For this purpose tools to probe into the cloud services are required. To elaborate on this issue we have chosen the data archiving and storage model used for medical service providers and hospitals.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","2155-6806;21556806","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT.

However, CAMs are inefficient in matching a numeric range with existing encoding methods. Two-hot, binary and Gray encodings exhibit a depth scalability problem where the CAM depth required increases with the maximum number M in the range. One-hot and Johnson encodings exhibit poor CAM width scalability O(M). We present a unique hybrid encoding scheme mixing the features of two-hot and Johnson codes to solve both scalability problems. For an arbitrary range, it uses only three CAM entries in depth regardless of M, and has a width scaling of O(radicM ).

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.","1525-3511;15253511","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524","","Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes","","9","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a “uncompromised” router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment. Third, we present a statistical analysis module for the detection of TCP packet dropping attacks. Three measures, session delay, the position and the number of packet reorderings, have been implemented in the statistical module.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead.

Mainly, some trust management basis may be exploited to fulfill new attacks. In this work, we present a holistic view on various trust management frameworks geared for MANETs, capable to handle main existing attacks deceiving trustworthiness computation to mislead trust-based network operations, referred to as trust-distortion attacks. Besides, we propose a taxonomy of main identified trust-distortion attacks based on how the trustworthiness estimation of a node about another node is distorted. Moreover, we provide a holistic classification of main evaluation metrics, which can be used to evaluate and compare such frameworks. For each framework, a unified approach is used to describe the trust model, taking each component required for trust management as a guideline. Moreover, each framework is analyzed regarding its resistance against different trust-distortion attacks, the framework unique features, merits, demerits, and findings.

This approach is applied to Internet2 traffic measurements to evaluate the time duration and spatial spread (number of links affected) of anomalies. Based on the empirical results, a node model is proposed that captures the behavior of anomalies at individual network nodes. The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies.

"IDGraphs: intrusion detection and analysis using histographs","Pin Ren; Yan Gao; Zhichun Li; Yan Chen; B. Watson","","IEEE Workshop on Visualization for Computer Security, 2005. (VizSEC 05).","","2005","","","39","46","Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for: 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies; 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns; 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the histographs (Pin Ren and Watson, 2005) technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks.","","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532064","","Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Computer security;Computer worms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Invasive software;Management information systems;Protection;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security","IDGraphs;correlated attack discovery;distributed attacks;flow-level trace;histographs;interactive visualization system;port scanning;statistical intrusion detection system;stealthy TCP SYN flooding;traffic anomaly;worm outbreaks;worm propagation pattern analysis","","7","2","31","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is very useful for countries with restricted human rights, but also in all the cases when someone has concerns about being watched or otherwise tracked. The main building blocks of the TOR network are TOR nodes that relay traffic in such way that each node knows for previous and next nodes. The special case are exit nodes that finally deliver traffic to it's intended destination, but that don't know from whom the traffic originates. All the TOR nodes are run by voluntaries throughout the Internet. It turns out that TOR network is heavily misused and thus it is dangerous to run TOR exit nodes as all the misuse of the network appears to be done from the exit nodes which could bring trouble to their owners. In this paper we analyse misuse of the TOR exit nodes and also propose mechanisms that could minimize, or even eliminate, misuse.

In particular, attack attribution and situational understanding are considered critical aspects to effectively deal with emerging, increasingly sophisticated Internet attacks. This requires highly scalable analysis tools to help analysts classify, correlate and prioritise security events, depending on their likely impact and threat level. However, this security data mining process typically involves a considerable amount of features interacting in a non-obvious way, which makes it inherently complex. To deal with this challenge, we introduce MR-TRIAGE, a set of distributed algorithms built on MapReduce that can perform scalable multi-criteria data clustering on large security data sets and identify complex relationships hidden in massive datasets. The MR-TRIAGE workflow is made of a scalable data summarisation, followed by scalable graph clustering algorithms in which we integrate multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Theoretical computational complexity of the proposed parallel algorithms are discussed and analysed. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms can scale well and efficiently process large security datasets on commodity hardware.

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors.

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","2","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798","False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust","Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing","Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value","","1","","21","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting.

In this paper, we present Fates, an anomaly-based NIDS designed to alleviate the two challenges. Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network. Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination. The resulting charge is applied to the individual hosts' threat assessment, providing pinpointed analysis of anomalous activities. We use various datasets to validate Fates's ability to distinguish scanning behavior from benign traffic in real time.","1095-2055;10952055","","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317884","Anomaly-based Detection;Network-based Intrusion Detection System","Computer science;Entropy;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Real time systems;Signal detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer network management;real-time systems;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Fates real-time anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;network host monitoring;network traffic;real-time anomaly detection","","0","","25","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without proper security measures, an enemy can launch various kinds of attacks in hostile environments. These attacks can disrupt the normal working of WSNs and can defeat the purpose of their deployment. Therefore security is an important aspect of these networks. Preventive mechanisms can be applied to protect WSNs against some types of attacks. However, there are some attacks for which there are no known prevention methods.

In this work, we attempt to quantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key characteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the number of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree. Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. Through both mathematical analysis and simulation, we find that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98% of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with the total number of infected hosts. Next, we study the infection structure of localized-scanning and permutation-scanning worms through simulation and surprisingly find that the above observations also apply to these worms. Finally, we apply our findings to evaluate bot assessment strategies for forensic analysis after a worm tree has been formed.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2204981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218774","Botnet;detection;probabilistic modeling;simulation;topology;worm infection family tree","Analytical models;Grippers;Internet;Joints;Mathematical model;Measurement;Peer to peer computing","Internet;Poisson distribution;computer network security;geometry;invasive software;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics)","Internet worm infection family tree characteristics;Poisson distribution;approximate-logarithmic average path length;asymptotic geometric distribution;bot assessment strategies;botnets;children;forensic analysis;host infection ability quantification;localized-scanning worms;mathematical analysis;permutation-scanning worms;probabilistic modeling methods;security threats;sequential growth model;simulations;vulnerable host;worm infection topology","","1","","40","","20120615","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A host of security issues need to be addressed for such interactive grids to gain acceptance, particularly in industry. The purpose of this paper is to study these security issues. The grid security infrastructure (GSI), a component of the Globus Toolkit (I. Foster et al., 1997), creates grid credentials for every user and resource. We describe how this may be extended to securely set up an interactive session on a remote host, and the additional security issues associated with interactive session management. We propose controlled shell and controlled desktop mechanisms that restrict the user to execute only authorized commands and applications, and controlled user and super-user accounts that customize the shell and desktop using policy files.

While this approach allows to efficiently manage network connectivity and reduce the time and cost of deploying new configurations, it also increases the risk for errors -- either introduced by accident, through a combination with previous policies, or by a motivated adversary.

Combined with existing work on cloud platform and storage security, this will contribute towards creating secure and trusted cloud deployments.","","","10.1109/UCC.2015.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431482","","Cloud computing;Complexity theory;Network operating systems;Network topology;Routing;Security","cloud computing;computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;trusted computing;virtualisation","centralized network controllers;data plane devices;efficient network virtualization;network architectural model;network connectivity management;network policy verification;scalable network multitenancy;secure SDN policy management;software-defined networking;trusted cloud deployments","","","","28","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation. By implementing intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies to spawn the reallocation process (a procedure called triggering), DARTS provides a flexible, lightweight, and scalable method to efficiently allow reconnaissance and other distributed sensing applications to occur on a mobile, airborne platform.","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5679552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679552","","Aircraft;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Sensors","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;security of data","ad hoc network;distributed agent;distributed apt resource transference system;distributed sensing method;fault tolerant distributed reconnaissance;flooding based resource discovery method;intrusion detection system;resource management;resource reallocation","","3","","16","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This misdemeanor is often the primarily methodology that is adopted by attackers prior to launching a targeted cyber attack. Hence, it is of paramount importance to research and adopt methods for the detection and attribution of cyber scanning. Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques. Moreover, it offers a taxonomy of the current literature by focusing on distributed cyber scanning detection methods.

Kobbane","Aalto University, Espoo, Finland","IEEE Access","","2014","2","","1128","1137","Machine type communications (MTCs) enable the communications of machines (devices) to machines over mobile networks. Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks. Finally, a real-life implementation of LightEPC on top of cloud platform is discussed.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2359649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906244","Carrier cloud;Machine type communications (MTC);mobile cloud networking;network function virtualization (NFV)","Logic gates;Machine-to-machine communications;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Object recognition;Protocols;Radio access networks;Servers","3G mobile communication;cloud computing;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","3GPP;LightEPC framework;MTC;NFV;cloud computing;cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks;machine type communications;network function virtualization;network node failures","","10","","27","","20140922","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X;0743166X","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","22","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci., Univ. of Pretoria, Tshwane, South Africa","Information Security for South Africa (ISSA), 2015","","2015","","","1","9","The internet has had a major impact on how information is shared within supply chains, and in commerce in general. This has resulted in the establishment of information systems such as e-supply chains amongst others which integrate the internet and other information and communications technology (ICT) with traditional business processes for the swift transmission of information between trading partners. Many organisations have reaped the benefits of adopting the eSC model, but have also faced the challenges with which it comes. One such major challenge is information security. Digital forensic readiness is a relatively new exciting field which can prepare and prevent incidents from occurring within an eSC environment if implemented strategically. With the current state of cybercrime, tool developers are challenged with the task of developing cutting edge digital forensic readiness tools that can keep up with the current technological advancements, such as (eSCs), in the business world. Therefore, the problem addressed in this paper is that there are no DFR tools that are designed to support eSCs specifically. There are some general-purpose monitoring tools that have forensic readiness functionality, but currently there are no tools specifically designed to serve the eSC environment. Therefore, this paper discusses the limitations of current digital forensic readiness tools for the eSC environment and an architectural design for next-generation eSC DFR systems is proposed, along with the system requirements that such systems must satisfy. It is the view of the authors that the conclusions drawn from this paper can spearhead the development of cutting-edge next-generation digital forensic readiness tools, and bring attention to some of the shortcomings of current tools.","","","10.1109/ISSA.2015.7335075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335075","Cyber-Crime;Digital forensic Investigation (DFI);Digital forensic data analysis tools;Digital forensic readiness (DFR);Forensics domains;Monitoring tools;Network forensics;e-Supply Chains (eSCs)","Business;Digital forensics;Filtering;Monitoring;Next generation networking;Software","digital forensics;electronic commerce;supply chain management","ICT;Internet;cybercrime;digital forensic readiness tools;e-supply chain;eSC environment;electronic supply chain;information and communications technology;trading partners","","","","12","","","12-13 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classification processing is one manner in which some designs accomplish this task. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) encompass one field of classification that has proven to yield high accuracy and has recently seen increased widespread use, however, the required computational intensity places a challenge on computer architects to design a hardware structure capable of performing real-time classifications while maintaining low power consumption. This paper proposes the first ever fully pipelined, floating point based, multi-use reconfigurable hardware architecture designed to act in conjunction with embedded processing as an accelerator for multiclass SVM classification. Several tasks, involving an extensive sample set of over 100,000 classifications, are evaluated for speed and accuracy against the same suite running on both an Intel Core i7-2600 system with lib SVM and an Nvidia GT 750M graphics card GPU.

Therefore, it is necessary to distribute intrusion detection sensors across multiple protected networks, manage their configuration as the security posture of the networks changes, and process the results of their analysis so that a high-level picture of the security state of the network can be provided to the administrators. This paper presents Hi-DRA, a network surveillance, analysis, and response system for high-speed WANs. The system provides a framework for the modular development of intrusion detection sensors in heterogeneous, high-speed environments. In addition, the system provides an infrastructure that supports the dynamic configuration of the sensors and the collection and interpretation of their results.

Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on","","2003","","","363","367","Many corporations and government organizations spend millions of dollars in the protection of their company or organizational data. These protection mechanisms often follow a secured layered approach, called defense in depth (DiD), which allow these organizations to have a more secured network based on security mechanisms at different areas of their network design. Defense in depth is the concept of protecting a computer network with a series of defensive mechanisms such that if one mechanism fails, another will already be in place to thwart an attack. Because there are so many potential attackers with such a wide variety of attack methods available, there is no single method for successfully protecting a computer network. Utilizing the strategy of defense in depth will reduce the risk of having a successful-and likely very costly-attack on a network. In today's environment there is more of a need than ever for increased security in enterprise level networks. Companies are finding themselves with offices around the world and needing a way to provide an affordable high speed secure communications between them as well as provide ways to implement wireless technologies in a secured environment. This paper describes an example of how this can be done and the special issues and challenges associated with securing these types of networks.","","","10.1109/SAINTW.2003.1210187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210187","","Communication system security;Companies;Computer networks;Costs;Data security;Government;Information security;Intellectual property;Protection;Wireless application protocol","Internet;business communication;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Internet;computer network security;corporations;defense-in-depth security architected network;enterprise level networks;government organizations;high speed secure communications;organizational data;wireless access points","","0","","15","","","27-31 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IDS to accomplish its function must, in some way, to guarantee reliability and availability to its own application, so that it gets to give continuity to the services even in case of faults, mainly faults caused by malicious agents. This paper proposes an adaptive fault tolerance mechanism for network intrusion detection system based on intelligent agents. We propose the creation of a society of agents that monitors a system to collect information related to agents and hosts. Using the information which is collected, it is possible: to detect which agents are still active; which agents should be replicated and which strategy should be used. The process of replication depends on each type of agent, and its importance to the system at different moments of processing. We use some agents as sentinels for monitoring and thus allowing us to accomplish some important tasks such load balancing, migration, and detection of malicious agents, to guarantee the security of the proper IDS","","","10.1109/SEUS-WCCIA.2006.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611713","","Availability;Face detection;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Information security;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Load management;Monitoring;Protection","computer networks;fault tolerant computing;information retrieval;multi-agent systems;security of data","authorization;fault tolerance;information retrieval;intelligent agents;network intrusion detection system;security","","3","","16","","","27-28 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have simulated in NS2 environment and shown the comparison of energy consumption or Residual energy of nodes having fixed transmission range with the proposed adaptive energy scheme. Adaptive energy scheme adjusts the range of transmission of each node based on the maximum distance between nodes in each cluster.

Anomaly detection has been one of the widely adopted security measures in wired and wireless networks. However, it is not straight forward to apply most of the anomaly detection techniques to IoT and cloud. One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from IoT to the cloud. Other challenges include the large number of sources generating data, heterogenous connectivity and traffic patterns of IoT devices, cloud services being offered at geographically remote places and causing IoT data to be stored in different countries with different legislations.

However, its success ratio for authentication may be not high, especially in large-scale Mobile Ad- Hoc Networks (MANETs). In order to address this issue, we propose a hybrid authentication scheme which integrates the chained authentication with the distributed authentication. When a node can't find enough authentication nodes in its one-hop neighborhood to authenticate itself it requests its neighboring nodes to find a certificate chain to do so through the chained authentication. Hence, our scheme overcomes the drawbacks in terms of success ratio for authentication. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies show that, compared with the chained authentication schemes, our scheme is more scalable and it can increase the success ratio for authentication, without sacrificing the security requirement.","","","10.1109/CIT.2007.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385175","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer networks;Computer science;Cryptography;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network servers;Public key;Scalability","ad hoc networks;message authentication;mobile radio;telecommunication security","chained authentication scheme;distributed authentication scheme;mobile ad-hoc network;trust establishment scheme","","5","","11","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has become a great challenge to develop scalable solutions for next-generation packet classification that support higher throughput, larger rule sets and more packet header fields. For low-cost high performance embedded networking applications, the best solution could be doing packet classification by special designed hardware, which can effectively release the burden of system CPU. In order to improve the speed of packet classification, exhibit good memory performance and support quick rule update, a high-speed packet classification system based on FPGA is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of parallel processing, pipeline and hardware circuit, the throughput has been improved greatly; defining the size of the tree nodes to be binary tree, the memory usage can be more efficient. The binary tree structure is generated through pre-processing on computer, which does not influence the searching speed of FPGA. During the packet header division, the division field is dynamic and selected according to the rules. The experimental results show that the pre-processing time for 50000 rules is shorter than 0.051s, the average speed of rule-header classification for Snort IDS is higher than 10 Gbps.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496433","Binary tree;FPGA;NIDS;Packet classification","Binary trees;Clocks;Decision trees;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks","IP networks;computer network security;parallel processing;pattern classification;pipeline processing;telecommunication network routing;tree data structures","CPU;FPGA;IP packet;NIDS;Snort IDS;binary tree structure;binary-tree-based high speed packet classification system;hardware circuit;high performance embedded networking application;network intrusion detection system;next-generation packet classification;packet header division;parallel processing;pipeline processing;processor performance;router;rule-header classification;serial program execution;software-based packet classification;tree node","","2","","10","","","28-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference. Compared with LLF, our algorithm costs about 5% memory to get the same performance.","1930-529X;1930529X","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425276","","Computer architecture;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Parallel processing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Web server","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;file servers;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","CMP architecture;FPGA technology;LLF algorithm;NIDS;communication overhead;flow-based load balancing;flow-based parallel processing;load balancing;multi-core system;network intrusion detection system;scheduling algorithm;web servers","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a hybrid approach that partitions the signatures into long and short ones in the open-source ClamAV for virus scanning. An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average skip distance, while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV. The latter increases the AC performance by around 50 percent due to better cache locality. We also rank the factors to indicate their importance for the string matching performance.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2010.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453354","String matching;automaton;filtering;virus scanning.","","automata theory;computer viruses;cryptography;digital signatures;public domain software;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;Wu-Manber algorithm;automata tracking;backward hashing algorithm;characteristic signature;open source ClamAV;string matching;virus scanning","","8","","28","","20100422","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nodes may lose power, crash, or simply move out of range of other nodes in the network. Identifying the root cause is complicated by a lack of fixed monitoring and analysis infrastructure. Past research has focused on monitoring using either ping, heartbeat, or gossip-based approaches, which can incur significant network wide overhead. This paper proposes a novel k-hop cluster based data dissemination scheme that can piggyback on routing messages for more efficient detection of failures including node disconnection. In this scheme, nodes forward their neighbour-hood observations to a per-cluster failure detector based on the observed spanning tree. Simulations show that detecting disconnected nodes using a cross-layer implementation of the data dissemination scheme is more efficient while an application layer implementation is faster. This effect is more pronounced in sparse networks.","2165-9605;21659605","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104019","MANET;cross-layer;data dissemination;failure detection;network efficiency","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Detectors;Heart beat;Mobile computing;Protocols;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","MANET;cross-layer cluster-based data dissemination;failure detection;k-hop cluster;neighbour-hood observation;node disconnection;node failure;routing message;spanning tree;sparse network","","2","","16","","","24-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, using open source web applications is a double-edged sword in that it supplies both attackers and defenders more control over their security aspect. Well-known attacks are aimed access resources that are not referenced by the web application and lead to information discloser. Inspired by the idea of a sniper lurking in the shadows of civilization as a secret guard, this paper proposes a framework-named Sniper-to improve the security of open source web applications. Mimicking a real sniper who hides in the bushes to watch and eliminate dangerous enemies, the proposed Sniper framework is hidden within the web application to capture potential attackers. To illustrate further, if an attacker approaches your website seeking sensitive data, Sniper will be there watching to detect the intrusion, notify the webmaster anonymously, and block the attacker based on predefined thresholds. Therefore, Sniper identifies and mitigates attack attempts ahead of time by monitoring suspicious traffic intended to reach forbidden or sensitive areas. Sniper was implemented and tested using three different open source web applications. As a webmaster, I cannot imagine a better lights-out monitoring solution that not only notifies me, but also blocks potentially malicious access.","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051949","","Electronic mail;Monitoring;Security;Testing;Web servers;Web sites","Web sites;computer crime;public domain software","Sniper framework;Webmasters;attack attempts detection;attackers;business Websites;intrusion detection;malicious access;official Websites;open source Web applications;personal Websites;security aspect;sensitive data;social network Websites;suspicious traffic monitoring","","0","","26","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs)","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors","cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","8","","49","","20120214","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Fourth International Conference on","","2008","","","243","248","In the autonomous environment of mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where nodes are free to move around and depend on each other to initiate communication, cooperation among nodes is an essential component of a successful data transmission process. Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources. In this paper, we provide evidence through simulation experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET intrusion detection system (IDS). We also discuss on how the similar friendship concept could be used to address several challenges faced in MANET environment.","","","10.1109/IAS.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627093","Friend Mechanisms;MANET;Small World","Ad hoc networks;Centralized control;Communication system control;Data communication;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Waste materials","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","MANET;QoS;autoconfiguration methods;autonomous environment;battery power;data transmission process;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;resource degradation;resource management","","2","","15","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks.

Today, the problem of trusting cloud computing is a paramount concern for most enterprises. It's not that the enterprises don't trust the cloud providers' intentions rather, they question cloud computing's capabilities regarding the security. To trust on the cloud, the cloud computing should have the appropriate technologies to tackle the accompanying challenges of trust. In this paper we proposed an algorithm which can increase the trust of the client on the cloud service provider. Different researchers have proposed different algorithms like data encryption and data decryption using private or public key concepts. But trust to cloud is basically based on cloud trust policies, which is not enough for the client to use cloud for the sensitive data. In this paper the proposed algorithm uses a function called key_function and the key which increases the trust to cloud during transmission. The cloud can ensure that the cloud server is providing necessary security for the user's data during transmission. By matching the key which is updated by the key_function, the user can be secured that the data accessed from the cloud server is secured.","2377-6927;23776927","","10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6922015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922015","SAAS;decryption;encryption;key;trust","Availability;Irrigation","cloud computing;cryptography;trusted computing","cloud computing;cloud service provider;cloud trust policy;computing services;data decryption;data encryption;key_function;private key concept;public key concept;trust scenario;user trust","","0","","26","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, ""denial of service"" (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach ""cross layer based intrusion detection system""(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance. The simulations conducted in ns2 and proved that our work achieved high performance with fewer overheads.","","","10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447185","AODV;Ad hoc Networks;Cross-layer Design;Denial-of-Service(DoS) attacks;IEEE 802.11;Intrusion Detection;MAC layer;Misuse or Signature Detection;Network Monitor;Routing layer;Security","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Protocols;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;MAC layer;cross layer based intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;malicious attack;network monitor;protocol stack layer;routing layer;signature detection;trace file pattern;wireless ad hoc networks","","3","","16","","","4-6 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, if the policy depends on the results of network security analysis, the controller will perform complicated packet processing such as packet reassembly and protocol analysis. Such processing will easily overburden the controller, and passing raw packets to the controller will result in large communications overheads. In this work, we propose an event-based SDN architecture for network security analysis. This architecture comes with an event extractor on the network device that performs protocol analysis to extract policy neutral events from network traffic. The network device looks up an extracted event in an event table to see whether a policy exists for the event. If not, it will ask the controller about the policy corresponding to this event and configure the policy in the event table accordingly. Since the controller deals with only high-level event descriptions, it is free from low-level packet processing. We evaluate this architecture by emulating it with the Bro intrusion detection system for event extraction from real traffic. The experimental results show the communication overheads between the network devices and the controller can be effectively reduced.","","","10.1109/CCST.2015.7389675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389675","","Communication networks;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Performance evaluation;Process control;Protocols;Security","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","Bro intrusion detection system;communication overhead;event-based SDN architecture;network security analysis;network traffic;packet processing;policy configuration;software-defined networking","","","","14","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the techniques that has been widely used for achieving such requirements is the employment of In-Memory Key-Value Storage (IMKVS) as caching mechanisms in order to improve overall user experience. Memcached and Redis are applications that use IMKVS approach. Commonly IMKVS clients use Consistent Hashing to decide where to store an object, which may cause network load imbalance. Furthermore, these clients work only at the application layer, so network conditions are not considered to distribute user's accesses. This paper proposes a new cache architecture with two phases load balancing to improve IMKVS performance, which has adopted a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture to manage the load balancing mechanism. The proposal was evaluated in the Mininet emulation environment and shows an improvement on load balancing giving best user experience.","","","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405549","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405549","","Computers;Control systems;IP networks;Load management;Protocols;Servers","computer centres;file servers;resource allocation;social networking (online);software defined networking;virtualisation","Mininet emulation;NFV;SDN;data center;datacenter;in-memory key-value storages;network function virtualization;social networks;two-phase load balancing","","1","","12","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware. The proposed architecture is able to efficiently handle large volumes of collected data and consequent high processing loads using Hadoop, MapReduce and cloud computing infrastructure. The main focus of the paper is to enhance the throughput and scalability of the IDS Log analysis.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011;10816011","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","11","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system.

Indicators (e.g. buffering ratio, and rate of buffering) are calculated by analyzing the HTTP stream and the attributes of the video itself (e.g. bitrate, and framerate), which are superior to traditional tools. Besides, a passive packet capture mechanism is provided to minimize user perception.

Especially with resource constraints in dynamic networks such as mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), security needs to be of particular consideration. In this paper, we first analyze the solution concept involved in optimizing resource allocation and data packet forwarding. In a MANET, the availability of having data packets forwarded may be insubstantial due to the presence of selfish nodes. Nodes may not want to participate in the network to preserve their own resources. We propose a packet-forwarding problem model with a negotiation game, where an arbitrator acts as a cluster head and initiates a bargaining game. Thereafter, we consider the possibility of having some group of nodes exhibit malicious behavior and collude to subvert the MANET. We investigate the problem by finding the optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies of the negotiation game. Then, we simulate the effect of the coalition of malicious nodes in a mobile environment. Simulation results support our model.","","","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490630","MANET;arbitrator;collusion;malicious nodes;negotiation game;network security","Ad hoc networks;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Reliability;Resource management;Security","game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;arbitrator cluster head;bargaining game initiation;colluding nodes;data packet forwarding;game theory;mobile ad hoc network;negotiation game;optimal Nash equilibrium strategy;packet forwarding problem model;resource allocation","","","","17","","","18-21 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A selfish node does not directly intent to damage other nodes with active attacks but it simply does not cooperate in network operation, saving battery life for its own communication. The problem of identifying misbehaving nodes that drop packets selectively, in order to degrade the network performance is analysed. This paper we deal with misbehaving nodes in MANETs that drop packets supposed to be relayed, whose purpose may be either saving their resources or launching security attacks.

Consequently, several recent works have proposed various distributed PCA algorithms aiming to reduce the communication overhead incurred by PCA without losing its inferential power. This paper evaluates the tradeoff between communication cost and solution quality of two distributed PCA algorithms on a real domain name system (DNS) query dataset from a large network. We also apply the distributed PCA algorithm in the area of network anomaly detection and demonstrate that the detection accuracy of both distributed PCA-based methods has little degradation in quality, yet achieves significant savings in communication bandwidth.","","","10.1109/CISS.2016.7460567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460567","Data partitioning;Distributed PCA;Network anomaly detection;Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Distributed databases;Matrix decomposition;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis","data handling;principal component analysis","DNS query dataset;communication bandwidth;communication cost;communication overhead;data partitioning;dimension reduction method;distributed PCA algorithms;distributed PCA-based methods;distributed principal component analysis;distributed systems;network anomaly detection technique;network bandwidth cost;performance overhead tradeoff;real domain name system","","","","11","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel decentralized and scalable architecture that can be adopted to realize a monitor of the agents' behavior is proposed. We consider agents which may perform different independent tasks, but cooperate to guarantee the entire system's safety. Agents plan their next actions by following a set of rules which is shared among them. Such rules are decentralized, i.e. they dictate actions that depend only on configurations of neighboring agents. Some agents may not be acting according to this cooperation protocol, due to tampering or spontaneous failure. To detect such misbehaviors we propose a solution where each agent runs a local monitor using only locally available information. The objective of the work is the definition of a basic framework to automatically realize decentralized intrusion detectors for (hybrid) multi-agent systems where interaction is modeled through logical cooperative protocols.","0191-2216;01912216","","10.1109/CDC.2007.4434902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4434902","","Condition monitoring;Fault detection;Intelligent robots;Intelligent transportation systems;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Remotely operated vehicles;Vehicle safety","mobile agents;multi-agent systems;security of data","cooperative mobile agents;decentralized intrusion detection;faulty behaviors;logical cooperative protocols;scalable architecture;secure cooperative multiagent systems","","16","","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The typical means by which an attacker breaks into a network is through a series of exploits, where each exploit in the series satisfies the pre-condition for subsequent exploits and makes a causal relationship among them. Such a series of exploits constitutes an attack path and the set of all possible attack paths form an attack graph. Present day vulnerability scanners are able to identify the vulnerabilities in isolation but there is a need for correlation among these vulnerabilities to identify overall risk of the network. In this paper we propose a novel approach by finding out an attack path consisting of logically connected exploits and extends it to an attack graph. The solution also finds out the set of root cause vulnerabilities for overall security threat while taking care the inherent time and scalability problem of attack graph generation.","","","10.1109/CIS.2007.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415455","","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Binary decision diagrams;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Equations;Information security;Information technology;Risk management;Scalability","","","","0","","12","","","15-19 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a Local Intrusion Detection (LID) security routing mechanism to detect Black Hole Attack (BHA) over Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) MANET routing protocol. In LID security routing mechanism, the intrusion detection is performed locally using the previous node of the attacker node instead of performing the intrusion detection via the source node as in Source Intrusion Detection (SID) security routing mechanism. By performing LID security routing mechanism, the security mechanism overhead would be decreased. Simulation results using the GloMoSim simulator show that the improvement ratio of the throughput gained by LID security routing mechanism and overall improvement reduction in the end-to-end delay and routing overhead.","2155-6822;21556822","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021809","Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector;Black Hole Attack;Local Intrusion Detection;Mobile Adhoc network;Source Intrusion Detection","Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","AODV MANET routing protocol;GloMoSim simulator;ad hoc on demand distance vector MANET routing protocol;black hole attack;end-to-end delay;local intrusion detection routing security;mobile ad hoc network;network attacks;wireless nodes","","7","","14","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and ""dysfunctional"" network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.","1095-2055;10952055","","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617","","Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing","attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures","","0","","12","","","9-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the march of cloud continues, it brings both new opportunities and new security challenges. To take advantage of those opportunities while minimizing risks, we argue that Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) integrated in the cloud is one of the best existing solutions nowadays in the field. The concept of intrusion detection was known since past and was first proposed in 1980s. Since that time IDSs are evolving. However, even several efforts have been made in the area of Intrusion Detection Systems for cloud computing environment, many attacks still prevail. Therefore, the work presented in this paper proposes a multi-criteria analysis and a comparative study between several IDS architectures designed to work in cloud computing environments. To achieve this objective, in the first place we will search in the state of the art for several consistent IDS architectures designed to work in a cloud environment. Whereas, in a second step we will establish the criteria that will be useful for the evaluation of architectures. Later, using the approach of multi-criteria decision analysis MacBeth (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) we will evaluate the criteria and assign to each one the appropriate weight according to their importance in the field of IDS architectures in cloud computing.

The current Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Operations Iraqi (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) demand a more efficient and scalable infrastructure to support warfighter transformation. To meet these emerging requirements, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) DoD teleport program office (TPO) is building an initial transformational net-centric architecture by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 with significant upgrades starling in FY 2006. The DoD teleport system provides the deployed warfighter access to the global information grid (GIG) by linking the space and ground segments through a worldwide, pre-positioned military and commercial satellite communications infrastructure. Through multiple radio frequency (RF) media (military and commercial bands), teleport provides inter-theater reach-back into the defense information systems network (DISN) and service command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems, as well as intra-theater communications support for tactical users. These interfaces enable the seamless, interoperable, and secure transport of command and control (C2), intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and mission critical information supporting warfighter global operations. The TPO net-centric teleport architecture converges all the voice, video, and data requirements into a single Internet protocol (IP)-based transport system, consisting of: satellite IP-based networking modems, a ""black"" convergence router suite, and a voice over IP (VoIP) gateway for unclassified voice. This architecture, combined with the global network operations (NetOps) construct, will enable significant bandwidth efficiencies for greater reach-hack and enhanced warfighting capabilities through dynamic bandwidth allocation req- ired for advanced capabilities such as unmanned aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As part of the Department's transformation, the teleport net-centric and circuit-based architecture will exist in parallel for some time to enable a gradual transition by the deployed warfighter. This architecture will be implemented in two phases beginning with a limited-IP design at two sites in FYO5 followed by a worldwide implementation at all DoD teleport locations. This paper highlights the implementation and intended operations of the new, net-centric teleport.","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1606159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1606159","","Bandwidth;Buildings;Circuits;Command and control systems;Information systems;Intelligent networks;Military communication;Military computing;Radio frequency;Satellite communication","IP networks;Internet telephony;bandwidth allocation;command and control systems;internetworking;military communication;modems;open systems;resource allocation;routing protocols;satellite communication;surveillance;telecommunication security;transport protocols","DISA;DISN;Defense Information Systems Agency;Department of Defense;GIG;GWOT;Global War on Terror;IP-based networking modem;ISR mission;NetOp;OEF;OIF;Operations Enduring Freedom;Operations Iraqi Freedom;TPO;VoIP gateway;bandwidth resource allocation;circuit-based communication technology;command-control system;commercial satellite communication;convergence router;defense information systems network;global information grid;global network operation;intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance;interoperability;intratheater communication;military satellite communication;multiple radio frequency;net-centric DoD teleport;teleport program office;transport security;voice over Internet protocol;warfighter transformation","","0","","","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas. The defenders can use the knowledge of such correlation between attack location and its impact to set higher security levels at particular positions by monitoring sensitive network parameters and detecting the anomalies.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2266399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525333","RPL;Rank attack;internal threat;performance;security","","Internet of Things;computer network security;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN routing protocol;Internet of Things;QoS parameters;RPL;ad hoc routing protocols;communication standard;control messages;control overhead;device management;energy saving performance;high forwarding load area;lossy networks;low-power networks;quality of service;rank concept;routing protocol network topology;security levels;wireless sensor network","","10","","7","","20130606","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated. Furt- ermore, superior configurations can be identified and assessed without endangerment of the productive network.","2325-5366;23255366","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568386","comparative evaluation;intrusion detection;intrusion detection correlation;optimization;real-world evaluation;test environment","Charge coupled devices;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sensors","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IT security;IT systems;NIDS;detection capability;false alarm rates;intrusion detection systems;knowledge based systems;network traffic;periodic performance evaluation studies;real - world networks;real-productive systems;system performance;unaltered live record","","2","","29","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, Cloud Computing is still a matter of great concern for a cloud user to trust security and reliability of cloud services. Cloud Computing is undergoing an incontestable success, which could be indeed compromised by concerns about the risks related to potential misuse of this model aimed at conducting illegal activities. There is major need of bringing security, transparency and reliability in cloud model for client satisfaction. One of the security issues is how to reduce the impact of any type of intrusion in this environment. To overcome these kinds of attacks, we propose a framework of cooperative Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (Hy-IDS) and Mobile Agents. Then, our Hybrid IDS consists of two types of IDS, which are dispatched over three layer of cloud computing. Therefore, in the first layer our framework allows to collect, analyze and detect malicious data using the first type of IDS and Mobile Agents. In case of attack, we collect at the level of the second layer all the malicious data detected in the first layer for the generation of new signatures, based on a Signature Generation Algorithm (SGA) and network intrusion detection system (NIDS). However, these new signatures are used to update the database of the IDS. The mobile agents play an important role in this collaboration. They are used in our framework for investigation of hosts, transfer data malicious and transfer update of a database of neighboring IDS in the cloud. Therefore, the neighboring IDS will use these new signatures to protect their area of control against the same type of attack. Applying this close-loop control, the collaborative network security management framework could identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","10.1109/CloudTech.2015.7337013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337013","Cloud Computing;Collaborative;Hy-IDS;Mobile Agents;Signature Generation Algorithm","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Virtualization","cloud computing;digital signatures;resource allocation;software reliability;trusted computing","Hy-IDS;NIDS;SGA;close-loop control;cloud computing;cloud service reliability;cloud service security;collaborative network security management framework;hybrid intrusion detection system;mobile agent;network intrusion detection system;resource sharing;signature generation algorithm;trusted framework","","","","23","","","2-4 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets. Post-place-and-route results show that when 8 characters are matched per cycle, our design can achieve 180 MHz clock rate, leading to a throughput of 11.8 Gbps.","2325-5552;23255552","","10.1109/HPSR.2012.6260830","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6260830","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;context;off-chip memory;packet flow","Context;Pipelines;Random access memory;Switches;Switching circuits;System-on-a-chip;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;logic design","REM;deep packet inspection;frequency 180 MHz;hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism;large-capacity memory;large-scale multiflow regular expression matching;large-size packet;off-chip memory;packet flow;packet processing operation;post-place-and-route;state-of-the-art FPGA device","","2","","13","","","24-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience. According to the simulation results, our proposed mechanism achieved similar video quality level compared with standard FEC, while reducing the transmission of redundant packets, which will bring many benefits in a resource-constrained system.","2160-4886;21604886","","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379150","Forward error correction;Intrusion detection;Multi-tier architecture;QoE;Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cameras;Forward error correction;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Redundancy;Streaming media;Video recording","forward error correction;image sequences;multimedia communication;quality of experience;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;video coding;wireless sensor networks","QoE-aware FEC mechanism;camera nodes;forward error correction;multimedia content transmission;multimedia intrusion detection;multitier WMSN;multitier network architecture;multitier wireless multimedia sensor networks;quality of experience-aware FEC mechanism;real-time video sequences;redundant packets;reliability;resource-constrained system;scalar sensors;ubiquitous systems;video quality level","","5","","25","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2050685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499108","Class-association-rule mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection","Data mining;Databases;Economic indicators;Fuzzy set theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Web and internet services","data mining;directed graphs;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;security of data","directed graph structures;fuzzy class-association-rule mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic network programming;intrusion-detection model","","49","","33","","20100701","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks.

However, they introduce new risks by allowing attacks on shared resources such as the file system, network and kernel. Existing security hardening mechanisms protect specific applications and are not designed to protect entire environments as those inside the containers. To address these, we present a LiCShield framework for securing of linux containers and their workloads via automatic construction of rules describing the expected activities of containers spawned from a given image. Specifically, given an image of interest LiCShield traces its execution and generates profiles of kernel security modules restricting the containers' capabilities. We distinguish between the operations on the linux host and the ones inside the container to provide the following protection mechanisms: (1) Increased host protection, by restricting the operations done by containers and container management daemon only to those observed in a testing environment; (2) Narrow container operations, by tightening the internal dynamic and noisy environments, without paying the high performance overhead of their on-line monitoring. Our experimental results show that this approach is efficient to prevent known attacks, while having almost no overhead on the production environment. We present our methodology and its technological insights and provide recommendations regarding its efficient deployment with intrusion detection tools to achieve both optimized performance and increased protection.

Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network. We also review the routing protocols of ad-hoc networks with trust considerations and select Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), a protocol that can be used in distributed ad hoc network settings for path discovery.","","","10.1109/WAINA.2010.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480623","mobile ad hoc networks;routing;security;trust;trust-formalization","Ad hoc networks;Collaborative work;Conferences;Distributed control;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;International collaboration;Resource management;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol","ad hoc networks;decision making;mobile communication;routing protocols","MANET;decision making;dynamic enterprise collaborations;dynamic source routing;mobile ad-hoc networks;networking technology;routing protocols;trust formalization","","4","","16","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose novel approaches for storage-based intrusion detection and discuss how features of state-of-the-art block storage systems can be used for intrusion detection and recovery of compromised data. In particular we present two prototype systems. First we present a real time intrusion detection system (IDS), which has been integrated within a storage management and virtualization system. In this system incoming requests for storage blocks are examined for signs of intrusions in real time. We then discuss how intrusion detection schemes can be deployed as an appliance loosely coupled with a SAN storage system. The major advantage of this approach is that it does not require any modification and enhancement to the storage system software. In this approach, we use the space and time efficient point-in-time copy operation provided by SAN storage devices. We also present performance results showing that the impact of ID on the overall storage system performance is negligible.

We compared two different adaptive network responses to these attacks against a baseline of no response for 10 and 20 node networks. Each response reflects a level of trust assigned to the captured node. Our simulation used a responsive variant of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm and focused on the response performance. We assumed that the attacks had been detected and reported. We compared performance tradeoffs of attack, response, and network size by focusing on metrics such as ""goodput"", i.e. percentage of messages that reach the intended destination untainted by the captured node. We showed, for example, that under general conditions a DoS attack response should minimize attacker impact while a response to a data swallowing attack should minimize risk to the system and trust of the compromised node with most of the response benefit. We show that the best network response depends on the mission goals, network configuration, density, network performance, attacker skill, and degree of compromise.","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290104","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Communications technology;Computer crime;Electronic mail;Intelligent networks;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing","ad hoc networks;military communication;telecommunication network routing","adaptive network;data swallowing attack;denial of service attack;on-demand distance vector routing algorithm;passive attacker;system adaptation;tactical ad hoc networks;tactical communications;trust response","","0","","5","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An abnormal component incurs a cost per unit time (depending on the criticality of the component) until it is probed and fixed.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011;10816011","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","2","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","2155-6806;21556806","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework. The experimental setup includes deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and network quarantining to secure a web server from network scanners.

Torng","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2014","22","6","1701","1714","Network intrusion detection and prevention systems commonly use regular expression (RE) signatures to represent individual security threats. While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms. For example, we are able to construct a D <sup>2</sup>FA with over 80 000 000 states using only 1 GB of main memory in only 77 min.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807837","Deep packet inspection;information security;intrusion detection and prevention;network security;regular expression matching","Automata;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Minimization;Standards","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;telecommunication security","D<sup>2</sup>FA;NFA;RE;XFA;bypassing space explosion;delayed input DFA;deterministic finite state automata;expensive nondeterministic finite automata;extended finite automata;high-speed regular expression matching;minimize then union framework;network intrusion detection;network prevention systems;regular expression signatures;security threats;union then minimize framework","","4","","37","","20140429","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key features of the Swift include: 1) extremely low filter update latency for dynamic packet filtering, and 2) gigabits-per-second high-speed packet processing. Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540","Linux kernel networking;packet filter","Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security","information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing","BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data","","2","","29","","20110224","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With fixed schedule and urban-wide coverage, an appealing service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to the public using buses, which allows mobile device users to send messages to locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in realizing this service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside adversaries.

Email: toelle@fgan.de","MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","","2006","","","1","7","This paper discusses the side effects of sanitizing IT security event messages in a cooperative multi-domain intrusion warning system (IWS). To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733","","Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology","Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security","IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities","","1","2","17","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We will emphasize on efficiency, robustness and accuracy. We will also try to demonstrate a hybrid approach obtained by combining the filtering-and-refinement method with the DBSCAN algorithm. In our experiments we pursued to compare the performance of the normal DBSCAN algorithm with the performance of the hybrid one. Our results indicate that the hybrid method is more accurate in terms of detecting anomalies and far superior in terms of speed than the normal DBSCAN algorithm.","","","10.1109/SACI.2011.5872976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872976","Anomaly detection;clustering","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency","data mining;security of data","DBSCAN algorithm;anomaly detection methods;data mining process;data sets;filtering-and-refinement method","","1","","17","","","19-21 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are four major concerns for such software dominant role, security, performance, reliability, and fault tolerance. Among them security is considered a major concern. SDNs security concerns include attacks on the control plane layer such as DoS attacks. This paper presents an inference-relation context based technique for the detection of DoS attacks on SDNs.

Unfortunately, the open medium, eclectic supply of nodes and dynamic topology make MANET defenseless to malevolent attackers. In this circumstance, it is crucial to foster proficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to guard MANET from a number of attacks.

With this approach, the inconsistencies often seen in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements are handled with a minimum of calibration. By taking off-line calibration measurement of a ZigBee sensor network, the inherent problem of signal uncertainty of to-be-localized nodes can be effectively resolved. The proposed RSSI-based algorithm allows flexible deployment of sensor nodes in various environments. The proposed algorithm has been verified in several typical environments and experiments show that the method outperforms existing algorithms. The location aware system has been integrated with an autonomous mobile robot to demonstrate the proposed on-demand robotic intruder detection system.

This paper proposes a grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system (GHIDS) which employs bottleneck verification approach to detect intrusions with low false alarm rate and high detection rate. Working within operating system kernel and performing bottleneck verification by integer comparison, GHIDS achieves high efficiency and accuracy.

A parameterizable cluster of simple processors provides system scalability. Hardware NIDSs described in the literature often employ hardwired comparators to verify if the incoming network traffic has data potentially containing intrusion attacks. Such NIDSs must be re-synthesized when a new set of rules is available, which happens frequently. In SPP-NIDS, the rule set defining network intrusion patterns is stored in RAM, enabling its straightforward upgrade. The proposed system, when implemented in a 2-million gate FPGA is able to work at a 100 Mbps network data rate, using the complete set of SNORT rules.

In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts. At the end of the review, the paper suggests fuzzy logic and other AI techniques to be exploited to reduce the rate of false alarms while keeping the detection rate high. In conclusion, the paper highlights opportunities for an integrated solution to large-scale CIIDS.","1098-7584;10987584","","10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584418","","Artificial intelligence;Collaboration;Correlation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Protocols","security of data","collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system;computer attacks;false positives;fuzzy alert correlation;fuzzy logic","","1","","25","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.","","","10.1109/EAIT.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032","Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node","Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV","data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack","","0","","18","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","5","3","47","","20090811","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","6","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Taken in isolation, the individual parts of UNISON encompass features already present in existing systems and infrastructures, however, UNISON combines these into a consistent whole, providing data storage/distribution and messaging/control in a simple, light-weight and unified fashion. We have prototyped UNISON as a self-standing middleware platform, and have used the resulting prototype to support a (similarly prototypical) generic, autonomous cyber defence system from DST Group's HINDER project. We discuss our experiences with UNISON in the context of this system.

Third International Conference on","","2008","","","1052","1059","A wireless ad-hoc network is a network which does not use any infrastructure such as access points or base station. Instead, the mobile nodes forward packets to each others, allowing communication among nodes outside wireless transmission range. In this dynamic network, each node is considered as a mobile router but in an energy-conserving manner. This fact makes node an active element in the network which is able of the best and of the worst. Actually, a malicious node can easily disrupt the proper functioning of the routing by simply refusing to forward routing message (misbehavior node), inject the wrong routing packets, modifying others, etc. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol for wireless ad-hoc network based on multi-agent systems and particularly on ant behavior. The novelty of our protocol relies in the fact that, apparently for the first time, a protocol combines at the same time routing on one side and trust level and reputation between nodes on the other side. This combination permits to increase the security of route establishment. More generally, this protocol opens the door to the use of different agents for obtaining different mixed functionalities, routing and trust level in this paper but also other functionalities like key-distribution.","","","10.1109/ARES.2008.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529460","","Ad hoc networks;Ant colony optimization;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Femtocell networks;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Multiagent systems;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;multi-agent systems;routing protocols;security of data","AntTrust;ant behavior;ant routing protocol;mobile nodes;mobile router;multi agent systems;trust;wireless ad hoc network","","1","","20","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Social analysis methods are applied to these matrices to detect suspicious behaviors of mobile nodes.

SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","2","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tampering with the kernel data is an attractive venue for rootkit writers since malicious modifications in the kernel are harder to identify compared to their user-level counterparts. So far however, the pattern followed for tampering is limited to hiding malicious objects in user-space. This involves manipulating a subset of kernel data structures that are related to intercepting user requests or affecting the user's view of the system. Hence, defense techniques are built around detecting such hiding behavior. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a new class of stealthy attacks that only exist in kernel space and do not employ any hiding techniques traditionally used by rootkits. These attacks are stealthy because the damage done to the system is not apparent to the user or intrusion detection systems installed on the system and are symbolic of a more systemic problem present throughout the kernel. Our goal in building these attack prototypes was to show that such attacks are not only realistic, but worse; they cannot be detected by the current generation of kernel integrity monitors, without prior knowledge of the attack signature.","1081-6011;10816011","","10.1109/SP.2007.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223229","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Detectors;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes","data integrity;data structures;invasive software;operating system kernels","attack signature;kernel code;kernel data structures;malicious modifications;stealthy attacks;systemic threats","","22","","18","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection.

This paper presents the design and implementation of DiMAPI, an application programming interface for distributed passive network monitoring. DiMAPI extends the notion of the network flow with the scope attribute, which enables flow creation and manipulation over a set of local and remote monitoring sensors. Experiments with a number of applications on top of DiMAPI show that it has reasonable performance, while the response latency is very close to the actual round trip time between the monitoring application and the monitoring sensors.

While security is an important concern in today's digital and physical world, sufficient research is not present in the network architecture of Wireless Nano sensor Networks (WNSNs).

So they can 't satisfy the IDS evaluation requirement in highspeed network environment. After analyzing the requirement of IDSs evaluation and the characteristics of network traffic, this paper proposes a differential equation model of active flow rate.

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks. I will construct the secured VOIP communication over MANET area using TCP / IP and storage Data in GSM modem as SMS (inbox).

Intrusion Response Systems (IRSs) extend IDSs by providing automatic protection mechanisms. The core of an IRS is its planning algorithm, in charge of selecting the best response action to counter the detected attacks. However, the planning algorithm has to be carefully designed and implemented in order to exhibit a low overhead and not to compromise the scalability of the protected system. In this paper we present the performance evaluation of an IRS based on Markov Decision Process (MDP), which leverages many-core co-processors. Such an IRS produces optimal long-term response policies evaluated according to a multi-criteria objective function. We show that, despite the complexity of the MDP modeling, the proposed IRS is able to protect large systems while introducing little to no overhead on the protected hosts.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2279-3; POD:978-1-5090-2280-9","10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568529","","","","","","","","","","","1-4 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters. These optimum static polling rates introduce minimum and maximum thresholds for the various scenarios mobile devices encounter on a daily basis.

In order to solve such security issues, we purpose a NIDS architecture which addresses the same constraints as a cluster: efficiency, scalability and reliability. It is based on the cluster paradigm. We stress on the facts that network packets must be dispatched according to streams and analysis must be load-balanced at process level.

A goal of this work is to be able to quantify and compare the merits of the different Internet latency reducing techniques, contrasting their gains in delay reduction versus the pain required to implement and deploy them. We found that classifying techniques according to the sources of delay they alleviate provided the best insight into the following issues: 1) The structural arrangement of a network, such as placement of servers and suboptimal routes, can contribute significantly to latency; 2) each interaction between communicating endpoints adds a Round Trip Time (RTT) to latency, particularly significant for short flows; 3) in addition to base propagation delay, several sources of delay accumulate along transmission paths, today intermittently dominated by queuing delays; 4) it takes time to sense and use available capacity, with overuse inflicting latency on other flows sharing the capacity; and 5) within end systems, delay sources include operating system buffering, head-of-line blocking, and hardware interaction. No single source of delay dominates in all cases, and many of these sources are spasmodic and highly variable. Solutions addressing these sources often both reduce the overall latency and make it more predictable.","1553-877X;1553877X","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2375213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967689","Data communication;Internet;algorithms;bufferbloat;comparative evaluation;congestion control;cross-layer;latency;networks;performance;protocols;queuing delay;standards;taxonomy","Delays;Internet;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Tutorials","IP networks;Internet;network operating systems;protocols;queueing theory;telecommunication network routing","Internet latency reduction;Internet protocol networks;base propagation delay;communicating endpoints;delay reduction;hardware interaction;head-of-line blocking;network structural arrangement;operating system buffering;overuse inflicting latency;performance bottleneck;queuing delays;round trip time;servers placement;suboptimal routes placement;throughput maximization;transmission paths;utilization maximization","","5","","","","20141126","thirdquarter 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","1060-9857;10609857","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With fixed schedule and urban-wide coverage, an appealing service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to the public using buses, which allows mobile device users to send messages to locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in realizing this service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside adversaries. Both rigorous privacy analysis and extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficacy of BusCast scheme.","1521-9097;15219097","","10.1109/PADSW.2014.7097847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097847","anonymous communication;backward unlinkability;message delivery;traffic analysis attacks;vehicular networks","Bismuth;Delays;Relays;Routing","data privacy;traffic engineering computing;transportation","BusCast scheme;ShanghaiGrid;information service;intelligent mobile device;message destination;privacy analysis;privacy information;privacy preserving message delivery;routing graph;routing scheme;trace-driven simulation;urban bus;urban traffic condition","","0","","16","","","16-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
