The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2012.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739,Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness,Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates,computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic,Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design,,1,,40,,5/29/2012,Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

They perform a wide range of important network functions, including WAN optimizations, intrusion detection systems, network and application level firewalls, etc. Depending on the processing requirement of traffic, packet processing for different traffic flows may consume vastly different amounts of hardware resources (e.g., CPU and link bandwidth). Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.",,978-0-7695-3747-4,,10.1109/ISPA.2009.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966,,Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness,multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation,P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment,,2,,16,,,10-12 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

An analytical framework for reasoning about intrusions,"Upadhyaya, S.; Ramkumar Chinchani; Kwiaty, K.","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings. 20th IEEE Symposium on",20020806,2001,,,99,108,"Local and wide area network information assurance analysts need current and precise knowledge about their system activities in order to address the challenges of critical infrastructure protection. In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance. Our main result is the modeling of user activity on a computing system as a martingale and the subsequent quantification of the cost of performing a job to enable decision making",1060-9857,0-7695-1366-2,,10.1109/RELDIS.2001.969760,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969760,,Costs;Delay;Encapsulation;Fault detection;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal resolution;Wide area networks;Yarn,computer network management;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;safety systems;system recovery,active response;analytical framework;cost analysis;critical infrastructure protection;decision making;error detection;intrusion detection solutions;intrusion signaling;martingale;network information assurance analysts;real-time assessment scheme;reasoning framework;recovery thread;system activities;user activity modeling,,5,,15,,,2001,28 Oct 2001-31 Oct 2001,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Several localization approaches have been proposed but most of them omit to consider that WSNs could be deployed in adversarial settings, where hostile nodes under the control of an attacker coexist with faithful ones. Verifiable multilateration (VM) was proposed to cope with this problem by leveraging on a set of trusted landmark nodes that act as verifiers. Although VM is able to recognize reliable localization measures, it allows for regions of undecided positions that can amount to the 40 percent of the monitored area. We studied the properties of VM as a noncooperative two-player game where the first player employs a number of verifiers to do VM computations and the second player controls a malicious node. The verifiers aim at securely localizing malicious nodes, while malicious nodes strive to masquerade as unknown and to pretend false positions. Thanks to game theory, the potentialities of VM are analyzed with the aim of improving the defender's strategy. We found that the best placement for verifiers is an equilateral triangle with edge equal to the power range R, and maximum deception in the undecided region is approximately 0.27R. Moreover, we characterizedâin terms of the probability of choosing an unknown node to examine furtherâthe strategies of the players.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2013.30,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560057,Game theory;localization games;security;wireless sensor networks,Electronic mail;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;Robustness;Wireless sensor networks,game theory;security of data;wireless sensor networks,VM;game theory;malicious node;node localization;noncooperative two-player game;probability;security games;trusted landmark nodes;verifiable multilateration;wireless sensor networks,,0,,42,,7/16/2013,Jan.-Feb. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

We propose a concise and scalable representation of these three attributes, that leads to a flexible visualization tool that is also clear and intuitive to use. Within our system, alerts can be grouped and viewed hierarchically with respect to both their type, i.e., the what, and to their where attributes. Further understanding is gained by displaying the temporal distribution of alerts to reveal complex attack trends.

Some formulas are derived to relate the network bit rate with the number of the processing units, their processing power, and memory size.

A Context-Based Analysis of Intrusion Detection for Policy Violation,"Wan, Kaiyu; Alagar, Vasu; Yang, Zong Yuan",,"Computational Intelligence and Security, 2007 International Conference on",20080104,2007,,,692,696,"Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) operate inde- pendently from security policy enforcement mechanism. In current IDS the functionality has been restricted to detect- ing only anomaly in system behavior and system misuse. In order to assist system administrators in restoring and strengthening system security after an intrusion is detected this paper proposes a method that will link the security vi- olation to a non-empty subset of the policy base. A multi- agent system is proposed to automate the intrusion detec- tion and analysis.
