Considering an elastic scaling model for cloud Security,"MacDermott, A.; Qi Shi; Merabti, M.; Kifiyat, K.","PROTECT: Res. Centre for Critical Infrastruct. Comput. Technol. & Protection, Liverpool John Moores Univ., Liverpool, UK","Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST), 2013 8th International Conference for",20140303,2013,,,150,155,"Cloud computing usage is growing, and soon the vast majority of organisations will rely on some form of cloud computing services. Cloud computing is being adopted in critical sectors such as energy, transport and finance. This makes cloud computing services critical in themselves. When cyber-attacks and cyber disruptions happen, millions of users are affected. Infrastructure vendors will inevitably take advantage of the benefits offered by the cloud computing environment, but while this may offer improved performance and scalability, the associated security threats deter this progression. There needs to be an assurance that confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data and resources is maintained. This paper provides an overview to the cloud security conundrum, details existing intrusion detection methods, and presents our observation and proposed elastic scaling method for cloud security.",,,,10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750181,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750181,cloud computing;critical infrastructure;intrusion detection;protection;security;threats,Algorithm design and analysis;Security,cloud computing;security of data,cloud computing environment;cloud computing services;cloud security conundrum;critical sectors;cyber attacks;cyber disruptions;elastic scaling method;elastic scaling model;infrastructure vendors;intrusion detection methods;security threats,,2,,24,,,9-12 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
