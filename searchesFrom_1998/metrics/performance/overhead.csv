Current security techniques, tools, and methods cannot prevent these cyber attacks. Attacks may finally lead to malfunctioning or even disabling the ICS for a long time. The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here.

Such actions include traffic remapping attacks (TRAs), which consist in claiming a higher traffic priority, i.e., false designation of the intrinsic traffic class so that it can be mapped onto a higher-priority class. In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet.

In this paper, we have proposed and simulated an enhanced detection mechanism in a Zone based Intrusion Detection System (ZBIDS). An extensive simulation is carried out to study the performance of ZBIDS under various routing attacks like blackhole, greyhole, wormhole and impersonation. The simulation results are based on the proposed architecture and shows that the enhanced ZBIDS has achieved desirable performance to meet the security requirement of MANETs.",,978-1-4673-6822-3,,10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219887,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219887,Zone based intrusion detection system;blackhole attack;grayhole attack;impersonation;wormhole attack,Ad hoc networks;Color;Computer architecture;Engines;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Routing,mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security,MANET;ZBIDS;blackhole;greyhole;mobile ad hoc networks;wireless communication;wireless networking;wormhole;zone based intrusion detection system,,0,,22,,,26-28 March 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Detecting distributed signature-based intrusion: The case of multi-path routing attacks,"Jiefei Ma; Le, F.; Russo, A.; Lobo, J.",,"Computer Communications (INFOCOM), 2015 IEEE Conference on",20150824,2015,,,558,566,"Signature-based network intrusion detection systems (S-IDS) have become an important security tool in the protection of an organisation's infrastructure against external intruders. By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.",,,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423,,Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization,computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic,asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate,,0,,21,,,April 26 2015-May 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections.

We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms.

The evaluation order of selection constructs can significantly influence the overall performance of multiple query evaluation. Consequently, based on the filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence of selection constructs dynamically captured at run-time, a selection-early strategy establishes the efficient evaluation sequence adaptively. For this purpose, the overall filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence is periodically monitored and the sequence is rearranged when its filtering capability is varied higher than a specific threshold. Accordingly, this strategy keeps the current evaluation sequence to be as efficient as possible by coping with a dynamic variation of its filtering capability.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques.

ELMO: Energy Aware Local Monitoring in Sensor Networks,"Khalil, I.M.","Fac. of Inf.

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.74,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654513,Sensor networks;local monitoring;malicious nodes.;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna,Antennas;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Sleep;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,ELMO;WSN;energy aware local monitoring;energy constrained system;energy consumption;local monitoring based security algorithm;sleep wake management;wireless sensor network,,3,,40,,12/3/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine
On the use of security analytics for attack detection in vehicular ad hoc networks,"Gantsou, D.","Univ.

As it is used for both supporting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, and connecting vehicles to external resources including cloud services, Internet, and user devices while improving the road traffic conditions, VANET is a Key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As such, VANET can be exposed to cyber attacks related to the wireless environment, and those of traditional information technologies systems it is connected to. However, when looking at solutions that have been proposed to address VANET security issues, it emerges that guaranteeing security in VANET essentially amounts to resorting to cryptographic-centric mechanisms. Although the use of public key Infrastructure (PKI) fulfills most VANET' security requirements related to physical properties of the wireless transmissions, simply relying on cryptography does not secure a network. This is the case for vulnerabilities at layers above the MAC layer. Because of their capability to bypass security policy control, they can still expose VANET, and thus, the ITS to cyber attacks. Thereby, one needs security solutions that go beyond cryptographic mechanisms in order cover multiple threat vectors faced by VANET.

Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network.

To minimize these drawbacks, we propose an event-driven intrusion detection architecture which integrates subject-verb-object (SVO) multi-point monitors and an impact analysis engine.

Enhancing security in CAN systems using a star coupling router,"Kammerer, R.; Fromel, B.; Wasicek, A.","Inst. for Comput.

Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based CAN are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based CAN, but are detected and contained on router-based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems.",,978-1-4673-2685-8,978-1-4673-2683-4,10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356590,,Automotive engineering;Multicast communication;Routing;Security;Software;Topology,computer network security;controller area networks;software maintenance,CAN router;CAN systems security;automotive applications;automotive domain;bus-based CAN;controller area network;denial-of-service attacks;eavesdropping;failure propagation;legacy CAN based systems;message fabrication;power train;router-based CAN;safety domain;safety-critical subsystems;star coupling router;trust model,,2,,24,,,20-22 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.",0743-166X,0-7803-7476-2,,10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404,,Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server,,,,86,7,35,,,23-27 June 2002,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Most of them scarcely try to combine the two issues together to propose an integrated solution, which is employed to defend the pivotal data and to recover the data when the intrusion has taken place. In this paper, we propose a framework of intrusion detection/recovery system (IDRS). This system is capable of detecting the intrusion on the file-level and recovering data on the block-level. Its advantages include that the file-level detection simplifies the implementation and the recovery based on the block-level can decrease the recovery time and raise the utilization ratio of storage devices. Again, considering that iSCSI has increasingly played an important role in network storage systems, we implement the IDRS prototype based on this promising protocol. The result of tests shows the extra storage overheads, arising from IDRS, are small (less than 10%). Therefore, we believe it is feasible to deploy IRDS on iSCSI systems to protect key files from damage.",,978-0-7695-3102-1,,10.1109/ARES.2008.59,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529401,,Availability;Data engineering;Data security;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Protection;Protocols,digital storage;file organisation;security of data,IDRS;block-level data recovery;file-level intrusion detection;iSCSI;network storage systems,,1,,16,,,4-7 March 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss.

Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation.

To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them.

IEEE International Symposium on",20091228,2009,,,1,10,"An emerging class of applications for enterprise wireless LANs (WLAN) is voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which impose a stringent requirement on end-to-end delay. Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device. As a result, the proposed architecture can automatically provide seamless network-layer handoff to a wide variety of mobile devices (such as PDA, portable, cell phone) running on different operating systems, as long as they are equipped with 802.11 network interface.",1526-7539,978-1-4244-4927-9,978-1-4244-4928-6,10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366648,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366648,,Cellular phones;Delay;Frequency;Hardware;Internet telephony;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Network interfaces;Operating systems;Roaming;Wireless LAN,IP networks;Internet telephony;cellular radio;mobile computing;wireless LAN,Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;PDA;cell phone;cellular networks;device-transparent network-layer handoff;enterprise wireless LAN;micromobility;mobile IP;mobile devices;voice over IP;wireless overlay network,,0,1,18,,,21-23 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Eighth IEEE International Conference on",20100115,2009,,,723,728,"Deep packet inspection (DPI) relies highly on regular expression due to its power of description, generalization and flexibility. In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination. SRD-DFA can be easily used with advanced DFA compression algorithms to achieve much less memory consumption.",,978-0-7695-3929-4,978-1-4244-5421-1,10.1109/DASC.2009.71,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380614,DFA;Minimization;Regular Expression,Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Power engineering and energy;Throughput,data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata,DFA compression algorithms;L7-filter rule set;Snort rule set;advanced DFA compression algorithms;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;extended DFA structure;memory consumption;packet payload;subrule distinguishable DFA,,2,,20,,,12-14 Dec. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Traditionally intrusion detection has relied on two data sources: various log files which record user's activity, and network traffic which contains potential threats. This research presents a system which we call IDEA; the Intrusion DEtection Automata system. We utilize a third source of data for intrusion detection in the form of an instrumented process. Open source software is recompiled using a modified compiler we have created, and the resulting executable program generates the data as it runs. An external monitoring facility then checks the behavior of the program against known good execution paths.

However, whether for selfish or malicious reasons, a node may fail to cooperate during the network operations or even attempt to disturb them, both of which have been recognized as misbehaviors. Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives. Our scheme evaluates trustworthiness from three perspectives: collaboration trust, behavioral trust, and reference trust. Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions.

For the GPU-to-GPU case, we consider several refinements to a base GPU implementation and measure the performance gain from each refinement. For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory. This analysis is done for GPUs with one I/O channel to the host as well as those with 2. Experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU that has 240 cores running off of a Xeon 2.8 GHz quad-core host CPU show that, for the GPU-to-GPU case, our Aho-Corasick GPU adaptation achieves a speedup between 8.5 and 9.5 relative to a single-thread CPU implementation and between 2.4 and 3.2 relative to the best multithreaded implementation. For the host-to-host case, the GPU AC code achieves a speedup of 3.1 relative to a single-threaded CPU implementation. However, the GPU is unable to deliver any speedup relative to the best multithreaded code running on the quad-core host. In fact, the measured speedups for the latter case ranged between 0.74 and 0.83.

ISCC 2007. 12th IEEE Symposium on",20071112,2007,,,71,78,"Distributed intrusion detection and prevention plays an increasingly important role in securing computer networks. In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a single point of failure . We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features.

In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.",,978-1-4244-1432-1,978-1-4244-1433-8,10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468,,Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN,,,,9,,16,,,10-14 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies.

Unveiling flat traffic on the Internet: An SSH attack case study,"Jonker, M.; Hofstede, R.; Sperotto, A.; Pras, A.","Centre for Telematics & Inf. Technol. (CTIT), Univ. of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Integrated Network Management (IM), 2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on",20150702,2015,,,270,278,"Many types of brute-force attacks are known to exhibit a characteristic `flat' behavior at the network-level, meaning that connections belonging to an attack feature a similar number of packets and bytes, and duration. Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.",,,,10.1109/INM.2015.7140301,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301,,Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes,Internet;computer network security;security of data,IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks,,0,,14,,,11-15 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node.

A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder","Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2007. SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,678,684,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, (1) impacts system performance, (2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, (3) addresses bad mouthing and (4) resists collusion.",,1-4244-1268-4,1-4244-1268-4,10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292881,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292881,,Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Resists;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML,XML;telecommunication security;wireless LAN,802.11 network;XML based policy engine;bad mouthing;centralized trust authority;misbehaving nodes;physical layer information;reputation vector;reputation-enabled intrusion detection system;software programmable devices;wireless networks,,3,,22,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion.

Performance Evaluation of Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS for MANET,"Agrawal, A.; Patidar, M.; Sharma, M.K.","Dept. of CSE, SIMS, Indore, India","IT in Business, Industry and Government (CSIBIG), 2014 Conference on",20150312,2014,,,1,6,"MANET is an infrastructure less network and can work without any devices dependencies. These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.",,978-1-4799-3063-0,,10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980,AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network),Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing,cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation,,0,,17,,,8-9 March 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards Web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion.

A protocol can be compared to a language definition: it contains a vocabulary, syntax definition and semantics. Like any computer language the protocol language must be unambiguous. The protocol specifies the behavior of concurrently executing processes. This concurrency creates a new class of subtle issues. One technique to address these issues is the finite state machine (FSM).

We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports. Based on our validation, we then identify and make available a list of 138 good Snort signatures, i.e., signatures that were effective in identifying validated malware without producing false positives.

Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of no-match cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of bad but cheap hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for on-access virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user.

SIMD parallelization of applications that traverse irregular data structures,"Ren, B.; Agrawal, G.; Larus, J.R.; Mytkowicz, T.; Poutanen, T.; Schulte, W.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","Code Generation and Optimization (CGO), 2013 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on",20130408,2013,,,1,10,"Fine-grained data parallelism is increasingly common in mainstream processors in the form of longer vectors and on-chip GPUs. This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units.

A PCA-based distributed approach for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks,"Ahmadi Livani, M.; Abadi, M.","Fac. of Electr. & Comput.

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.",,978-1-4244-9153-7,,10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585,distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network,Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks,principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks,,2,,15,,,23-24 Feb. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory.

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as 1 and the other is marked as 0. During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform.

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches.

Accelerating network applications on X86-64 platforms,Gao Xia; Bin Liu,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Technol., Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2010 IEEE Symposium on",20100812,2010,,,906,912,"The emerging multi-core platforms provide a high-performance, easy-to-develop and flexible way to implement high-speed network applications. For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.",1530-1346,978-1-4244-7754-8,,10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496,,Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols,,,,1,,24,,,22-25 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Data-centric anomalies in sensor network deployments: analysis and detection,"Abuaitah, G.; Bin Wang","BMW Networking Res. Lab., Wright State Univ., Dayton, OH, USA","Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems (MASS), 2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on",20140111,2012,Supplement,,1,6,"Recent real-world sensor network deployments have helped decision makers and sensor data analysts draw highly precise conclusions by relying on finer-grained raw sensory data. A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.",,978-1-4673-2433-5,,10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514,,Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors,decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks,base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary,,2,,,,,8-11 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A Robust Approach for Matching Mixed Casesensitive and Case-insensitive Patterns,Hongbin Lu; Kai Zheng; Bin Liu; Changhua Sun,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing","Networking and Services, 2007. ICNS. Third International Conference on",20080122,2007,,,72,72,"As one of the key methods as well as a bottleneck for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes) to detect and eliminate malicious traffic, pattern matching is increasingly gaining popularity while also faces threats from hackers' overloading attempts. The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the Search phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.",,978-0-7695-2858-9,,10.1109/ICNS.2007.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321,,Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system,,0,,15,,,19-25 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Attack-Tolerant Time-Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Xin Hu; Taejoon Park; Shin, K.G.","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Achieving secure time-synchronization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a challenging, but very important problem that has not yet been addressed effectively. This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-2025-4,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612,,Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network,,9,,26,,,13-18 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced.

Univ., Singapore, Singapore","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110117,2011,8,2,233,245,"The uniqueness of security vulnerabilities in ad hoc networks has given rise to the need for designing novel intrusion detection algorithms, different from those present in conventional networks. In this work, we propose an autonomous host-based intrusion detection system for detecting malicious sinking behavior. The proposed detection system maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross-layer features to define a routing behavior. For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed. Experiments based on simulation show that the proposed cross-layer approach aided by a combination of SVM and FDA performs significantly better than other existing approaches.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2009.48,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374416,Cross-layer design;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;routing attacks;sinking.,,ad hoc networks;radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security,Fisher discriminant analysis;MAC layer;autonomous host-based intrusion detection;cross-layer detection;malicious node behavior;malicious sinking behavior;packet drop ratio;security vulnerabilities;support vector machines;traffic density;wireless ad hoc networks,,6,,28,,1/8/2010,March-April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks.

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden.

SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability.

Moreover, event sensors and IDS stub, as the core components of IDS, are separately isolated from target systems, so strong reliability is also achieved in this architecture.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications.

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device.

In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption.

Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates.

Collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS): a framework for accurate and efficient IDS,"Yu-Sung Wu; Foo, Bingrui; Yongguo Mei; Bagchi, S.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual",20040108,2003,,,234,244,"We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.",,0-7695-2041-3,,10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328,,Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel,Internet;belief networks;security of data,Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors,,12,,19,,,8-12 Dec. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A Memory Efficient Multiple Pattern Matching Architecture for Network Security,Tian Song; Wei Zhang; Dongsheng Wang; Yibo Xue,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters.

To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors.

To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach.

Eng., Zhejiang Gongshang Univ., Hangzhou, China","Systems Journal, IEEE",20141120,2014,8,4,1049,1059,"Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate the computation with physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques.

At the link adaptation layer, the virtual interface provides link transparency to the upper layers and session management is handled at the interface manager. At the network layer, most IP-based ad hoc routing protocols can be accommodated. At the transport layer, the transport manager is instructed by the interface manager to adapt the transmission rate according to the new wireless link. Finally, at the application layer, the security manager handles various aspects of security concerns. Simulation results show that our approach can deliver low packet loss, low latency, and smooth handoff solutions with minimum packet overhead.

In this paper, we describe a recent extension of the LSM framework that enables labeled network communication via IPsec that is now available in mainline Linux as of version 2.6.16. This functionality enables machines to control communication with processes on other machines based on the security label assigned to an IPsec security association.

We examine here from a number of perspectives how this could be accomplished as a kind of vaccination of systems to reduce numbers of attacks and their severity. We develop a mathematical model of what would make an attacker go away. We report experiments with deliberate distortions on text to see at what point people could detect deception, and discover they can respond to subtle clues.

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds.

There is an emerging need for parallel intrusion detection techniques that can keep up with the increasing network throughput. A novel algorithm of load balance in the parallel IDS (intrusion detection system) was proposed to improve detection ability of parallel IDS. The algorithm was adopted to hash the network packet header information in data packet, to map the corresponding packet to the scope of the sensors' number, and to adjust the scope according to the performance and load of each sensor.

However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator.

Towards Database Firewall: Mining the Damage Spreading Patterns,"Bai, K.; Peng Liu","The Pennsylvania State University, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2006. ACSAC '06. 22nd Annual",20061226,2006,,,449,462,"Access control and integrity constraints are well known approaches to ensure data integrity in commercial database systems. However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.",1063-9527,0-7695-2716-7,,10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189,,Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases,,,,4,,24,,,Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.",1542-1201,978-1-4673-0267-8,978-1-4673-0268-5,10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906,,Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning,Internet;computer network management;computer network security,Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices,,0,,19,,,16-20 April 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven, off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management guestimate. Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an Extreme Project is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques.

Hierarchical Trust Management for Wireless Sensor Networks and its Applications to Trust-Based Routing and Intrusion Detection,Fenye Bao; Ing-Ray Chen; MoonJeong Chang; Jin-Hee Cho,"Dept. of Comput.

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ground truth node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives.

We report our experience with the modeling and detection of scoped invariants. The Xen Virtual Machine Manager is used for a case study.

In recent years, many attempts have been made to study the intrinsic attributes of these insider attacks but the focus has generally been on the analysis of one or very few particular attacks, or only the survey of various attacks without any performance analysis. Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol. Route modification attacks such as sinkhole and blackhole are deadly and severely affect the packet efficiency and bring down the throughput to unacceptable ranges.",,978-1-4673-2172-3,,10.1109/TrustCom.2012.199,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296111,Blackhole;Hello flood;MANETs;Network layer attacks;RREQ flood;Selective forwarding;Selfish Node;Sinkhole,Ad hoc networks;Data models;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput,mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security,AODV routing protocol;MANET;RREQ flood;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;blackhole;blackhole attack;hello flood;malicious AODV;mobile ad hoc networks security;performance metrics;route modification attacks;routing attacks;selective forwarding attack;selfish node behavior;sinkhole;sinkhole attack,,4,,17,,,25-27 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Many immune-inspired techniques have been developed with the aim to tackle different computing problems. Network security represents one of the most significant fields that the immune-inspired techniques have been applied to. Given that mobile ad hoc networks have a decentralized nature similar to the human immune system (HIS), immune-inspired security architecture is highly expected to come across different ad hoc security problems, one of which is the malicious node that can disrupt the routing process, masquerade as the legitimate nodes, and impersonate the trusted nodes. In this paper, immune-inspired security architecture for simulating a number of HIS processes for securing mobile ad hoc networks is presented.

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

A methodology for P2P file-sharing traffic detection,"Spognardi, A.; Lucarelli, A.; Di Pietro, R.","Dipt. di Informatica, Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Italy","Hot Topics in Peer-to-Peer Systems, 2005. HOT-P2P 2005. Second International Workshop on",20051024,2005,,,52,61,"Since the widespread adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking during the late '90s, P2P applications have multiplied. Their diffusion and adoption are witnessed by the fact that P2P traffic accounts for a significant fraction of Internet traffic. Further, there are concerns regarding the use of these applications, for instance when they are employed to share copyright protected material. Hence, in many situations there would be many reasons to detect P2P traffic. In the late '90s, P2P traffic was easily recognizable since P2P protocols used application-specific TCP or UDP port numbers. However, P2P applications were quickly empowered with the ability to use arbitrary ports in an attempt to go undetected. Nowadays, P2P applications explicitly try to camouflage the originated traffic in an attempt to go undetected. Despite the presence of rules to detect P2P traffic, no methodology exists to extract them from applications without the use of reverse engineering. In this paper we develop a methodology to detect P2P traffic. It is based on the analysis of the protocol used by a P2P application, extraction of specific patterns unique to the protocol, coding of such a pattern in rules to be fed to an intrusion detection system (IDS), and validation of the pattern via network traffic monitoring with SNORT (an open source IDS) fed with the devised rules. In particular, we present a characterization of P2P traffic originated by the OpenNap and WPN protocols (implemented in the WinMx application) and FastTrack protocol (used by KaZaA) obtained using our methodology, that shows the viability of our proposal. Finally, we conclude the paper exposing our undergoing efforts in the extension of the methodology to exploit differences between centralized and decentralized P2P protocols, as well as the characterization of encrypted traffic, and highlight a new research direction in the identification of P2P traffic.",,0-7695-2417-6,,10.1109/HOT-P2P.2005.2,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517791,,Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Protection;Protocols;Reverse engineering;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;copyright;pattern recognition;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,FastTrack protocol;Internet traffic;KaZaA;OpenNap protocol;P2P application;P2P file-sharing traffic detection;P2P protocols;P2P traffic;SNORT;TCP;UDP;WPN protocol;copyright protected material;encrypted traffic characterization;intrusion detection system;network traffic monitoring;pattern extraction;peer-to-peer networking;reverse engineering,,12,1,23,,,21-Jul-05,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming.

In the proposed method, the IDS has additional knowledge about common multimedia file formats and uses this knowledge to perform a more detailed analysis of packets carrying that type of data.

Storage-based intrusion detection system (SIDS) has become a valuable tool in monitoring for the intrusion. However, the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection. Through analysis, we find that the impact of intrusion detection on the OBSS is negligible. The advantage of this approach is simple.

Proceedings.15th International Conference on",20070122,2006,,,5,10,"This paper proposes an attack-resilient routing architecture, called cross-layer active re-routing (CARE), for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and dysfunctional network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.",1095-2055,1-4244-0572-6,,10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617,,Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing,attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures,,0,,12,,,9-11 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset.

Detecting Sinkhole attacks in wireless sensor networks,"Tumrongwittayapak, C.; Varakulsiripunth, R.","Fac. of Eng., King Mongkut''s Inst. of Technol. Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand","ICCAS-SICE, 2009",20091113,2009,,,1966,1971,"Presently, the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used in many areas of communication systems and its security system becomes very important. However, the security mechanism for WSNs has to be considered differently from traditional network. Firstly, there are severe constraints on WSNs devices such as minimal energy, computational and communicational capabilities. Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is lightweight due to the monitor nodes were not loaded with any ordinary nodes or BS. Moreover, the proposed mechanism does not cause the communication overhead.",,978-4-907764-34-0,978-4-907764-33-3,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334764,detecting sinkhole attacks;intruder detection;security in wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks,Bandwidth;Communication system security;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,RSSI;base station;communication system;extra monitor node;intrusion detection;node capture;physical attack;received signal strength indicator;security system;sinkhole attack detection;tampering;wireless sensor network,,0,,19,,,18-21 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In cognitive radio networks, effect of these malicious users on network performance becomes more threatening, where they impersonate primary users by emitting similar signals, causing secondary users to vacate the occupied channel needlessly. As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated.

This work presents an innovative architecture to realize string matching in sub-linear time based on algorithmic heuristics, which come from parallel queries to a set of space-efficient Bloom filters. The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module. This architecture is simulated with both behavior simulation in C and timing simulation in HDL for antivirus applications.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.210,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919,Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.,Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement,Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration,,3,,32,,11/9/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

In this sense, approaches like localized geographic routing are very promising. Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph of the network. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces.

In existing system Researchers main attraction is on designing new prevention, detection and response mechanism for MANETs. The scheme will identify, supervise and observe the malicious nodes without adjusting the performances in the network. The motivation is to overcome the issues such as limited transmission power, packet dropping, receiver collision and false misbehavior reports generation of the Watchdog system.

Hybrid Transactions: Lock Allocation and Assignment for Irrevocability,"Sreeram, J.; Santosh Pande",,"Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), 2012 IEEE 26th International",20120816,2012,,,1192,1203,Irrevocable Software Memory Transactions provide a safe way to perform certain unrecoverable operations such as I/O or system calls inside transactions. In this paper we show that this notion of irrevocability has strong relevance and impact on the performance and throughput of a transactional program. In this paper we propose a compile-time analysis and transactional memory runtime system that allows several irrevocable transactions to execute concurrently with normal revocable transactions unlike state-of-the-art methods that allow for at most one irrevocable transaction at a time. Our approach uses a compile-time analysis to derive a fine-grained lock-assignment scheme using a precise context-sensitive data structure analysis that is able to identify disjoint logical data structures.

In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor.

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience.

Some of the inspections one may make look for consistency with respect to data available only at the application layer, requiring one to position the analysis high in the protocol stack. Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer. Policy engine rules may refer to the structure and behavior of the AMI protocol, and may also perform multi-stage analysis of data payloads looking for evidence that executable code is carried, rather than data.

Intrusion detection in wireless ad hoc networks,"Mishra, A.; Nadkarni, K.; Patcha, A.","Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","Wireless Communications, IEEE",20040816,2004,11,1,48,60,"Intrusion detection has, over the last few years, assumed paramount importance within the broad realm of network security, more so in the case of wireless ad hoc networks. These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response.

PDA-misbehaving node detection & prevention for MANETs,"Prasannavenkatesan, T.; Raja, R.; GaneshKumar, P.","Inf. Technol. Dept., Anna Univ.

Mobile ad hoc networks are gaining popularity because of the availability of low cost mobile devices and its ability to provide instant wireless networking capabilities. MANET is an infrastructure less network and there is no central administration. The open medium, wide distribution of nodes, changing topology and no centralized monitoring makes MANETs vulnerable to malicious attackers. For these types of networks, security is the most essential service to provide protection and prevent malicious attacks occurring in the mobile nodes. Attackers can easily compromise MANETs by inserting malicious or non cooperative nodes into the network. To compensate MANET from these malicious activities in this paper, it is proposed a new intrusion detection & prevention algorithm named as Packet Dropping detection Algorithm (PDA). MANETs depends on the cooperation of nodes in the network for the forwarding of packets to the destination. The Cooperation requires detecting routes on the neighbor nodes. The cooperative node having malicious activity by the attacker may not forward or drops the packets, partially or fully. By PDA algorithm the neighbor nodes inform about the attacker by raising a global alarm and prevent an intruder from the malicious attacks in the network.",,978-1-4799-3357-0,,10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950037,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950037,PDA;detection;misbehaving node;packet dropping;prevention,Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nominations and elections;Protocols,mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security,MANET;PDA algorithm;PDA-misbehaving node detection;PDA-misbehaving node prevention;changing topology;cooperative node;intruder prevention;intrusion detection-prevention algorithm;low-cost mobile devices;malicious activity;malicious attack detection;malicious attack prevention;malicious attackers;malicious node;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;neighbor nodes;node cooperation;node distribution;noncooperative nodes;packet dropping detection algorithm;packet forwarding;route detection;wireless networking capabilities,,0,,10,,,3-5 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

CompactDFA: Generic State Machine Compression for Scalable Pattern Matching,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160,,Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils,data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data,Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms,,14,1,21,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application.

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms.

The privacy of users is of paramount importance to administrators and organizations, which are reluctant to cooperate between each other and exchange network traffic traces. The main reasons behind reluctance to exchange monitored data are the protection of the users' privacy and the fear of information leakage about the internal infrastructure. Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic. Our effort focuses on the design and implementation of a generic and flexible anonymization framework that provides extended functionality, covering multiple aspects of anonymization needs and allowing fine-tuning of privacy protection level.

On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space.

Their performance is judged by three criteria: processing overhead, space overhead, and false positive ratio. Due to wide applicability, any improvement to the performance of Bloom filters can potentially have broad impact in many areas of networking research. In this paper, we propose Bloom-1, a new data structure that performs membership check in one memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a classical Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this new family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller and comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected.

We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a uncompromised router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment.

The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability.

The current Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Operations Iraqi (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) demand a more efficient and scalable infrastructure to support warfighter transformation. To meet these emerging requirements, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) DoD teleport program office (TPO) is building an initial transformational net-centric architecture by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 with significant upgrades starling in FY 2006. The DoD teleport system provides the deployed warfighter access to the global information grid (GIG) by linking the space and ground segments through a worldwide, pre-positioned military and commercial satellite communications infrastructure. Through multiple radio frequency (RF) media (military and commercial bands), teleport provides inter-theater reach-back into the defense information systems network (DISN) and service command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems, as well as intra-theater communications support for tactical users. These interfaces enable the seamless, interoperable, and secure transport of command and control (C2), intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and mission critical information supporting warfighter global operations. The TPO net-centric teleport architecture converges all the voice, video, and data requirements into a single Internet protocol (IP)-based transport system, consisting of: satellite IP-based networking modems, a black convergence router suite, and a voice over IP (VoIP) gateway for unclassified voice. This architecture, combined with the global network operations (NetOps) construct, will enable significant bandwidth efficiencies for greater reach-hack and enhanced warfighting capabilities through dynamic bandwidth allocation req- ired for advanced capabilities such as unmanned aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As part of the Department's transformation, the teleport net-centric and circuit-based architecture will exist in parallel for some time to enable a gradual transition by the deployed warfighter. This architecture will be implemented in two phases beginning with a limited-IP design at two sites in FYO5 followed by a worldwide implementation at all DoD teleport locations.

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.",1525-3511,978-1-4244-1997-5,,10.1109/WCNC.2008.493,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524,,Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security,MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes,,9,,14,,,March 31 2008-April 3 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes.

We improve such backtracking techniques by logging certain additional parameters of the file system during normal operations (real-time) and examining the logged information during the analysis phase.

So far the focus of most studies of this problem has been on either blocking unused ports (fire-walling) or detecting attacks with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper we introduce the design and implementation of SecureDirect, which is an attempt at addressing the problem of intrusion prevention by combining an IDS with a stateful load balancer SecureDirect is a real time load balancer that distinguishes between traffic coming from good clients and traffic originating from attackers.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load.

A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents.

Proceedings. 19th IEEE International",20050418,2005,,,8 pp.,,"Various routing attacks for single-path routing have been identified for wireless ad hoc networks and the corresponding counter measures have been proposed in the literature. However, the effects of routing attacks on multi-path routing have not been addressed. In this paper, the performance of multi-path routing under wormhole attack is studied in detail. The results show that multi-path routing is vulnerable to wormhole attacks. A simple scheme based on statistical analysis (called SAM) is proposed to detect such attacks and to identify malicious nodes. Comparing to the previous approaches (for example, using packet leash), no special requirements (such as time synchronization or GPS) are needed in the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that SAM successfully detects wormhole attacks and locates the malicious nodes in networks with different topologies and with different node transmission range.

This method focuses on malwares which impersonate a legitimate process by injecting malicious codes into the process. This method extracts two process images. One is obtained from a process to be checked (target process) generating suspicious communication. The other is obtained by executing the same executable as the target process in a clean Virtual Machine. Then the two process images are compared to extract injected codes.

Two-tier data-driven intrusion detection for automatic generation control in smart grid,"Ali, M.Q.; Yousefian, R.; Al-Shaer, E.; Kamalasadan, S.; Quanyan Zhu","Dept. of Software & Inf.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying.

Security vulnerabilities and solutions for packet sampling,"Goldberg, S.; Rexford, J.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ","Sarnoff Symposium, 2007 IEEE",20080716,2007,,,1,7,"Packet sampling supports a range of Internet measurement applications including characterizing the spatial flow of traffic through a network for traffic engineering purposes, identifying the flows utilizing a link for billing purposes or for intrusion detection, and monitoring end-to-end data-path quality. However, packet-sampling mechanisms must be robust to adversarial hosts that craft packet streams that are disproportionately selected by a packet sampler. For example, a botnet flooding a network with packets in a denial-of-service attack, or a greedy customer trying to avoid being billed for network utilization, each have a strong incentive to craft packet streams that evade selection by the packet sampler.

The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node.

As a scalable and parameter-free unsupervised AD technique, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has attracted a lot of attention for its applications in computer networks and WSNs. However, the nature of lazy-learning makes the kNN-based AD schemes difficult to be used in an online manner, especially when communication cost is constrained. In this paper, a new kNN-based AD scheme based on hypergrid intuition is proposed for WSN applications to overcome the lazy-learning problem. Through redefining anomaly from a hypersphere detection region (DR) to a hypercube DR, the computational complexity is reduced significantly. At the same time, an attached coefficient is used to convert a hypergrid structure into a positive coordinate space in order to retain the redundancy for online update and tailor for bit operation. In addition, distributed computing is taken into account, and position of the hypercube is encoded by a few bits only using the bit operation. As a result, the new scheme is able to work successfully in any environment without human interventions.

Parsing application layer protocol with commodity hardware for SDN,Hao Li; Chengchen Hu; Junkai Hong; Xiyu Chen; Yuming Jiang,"Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an, China","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2015 ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20150521,2015,,,51,61,"The de facto implementation of Software Defined Networking (SDN), i.e., OpenFlow, only parses L2-L4 headers, which limits the use of SDN to employ control intelligence in application layer. In this paper, we advocate content parsing to empower SDN with finer grained control ability over traffic. Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols.

Changes to satisfy telecommunication needs within the technical community have surfaced gradually through the efforts of international computer standards organizations, technical panels, and guidance committees. The design of a secure computer communications architecture to protect the integrity of information exchange is pursued by the aerospace industry, the commercial and financial sectors, and at all levels of government agencies. Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks.

Detection and repair of software errors in hierarchical sensor networks,"Herbert, D.; Yung-Hsiang Lu; Bagchi, S.; Zhiyuan Li","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN","Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing, 2006. IEEE International Conference on",20060619,2006,1,,8 pp.,,"Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for collecting critical data in various applications. Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (invariants). These invariants are associated with conditions (the observed variables) of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network.

This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior.

In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted.

CCNC 2009. 6th IEEE",20090218,2009,,,1,8,"Intrusion detection systems (EDSs) deal with large amounts of data containing irrelevant and/or redundant features. These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms can deliver satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and testing time.",,978-1-4244-2308-8,978-1-4244-2309-5,10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784780,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784780,,Bit error rate;Computer crime;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing,computer networks;security of data;support vector machines,ESVDF;backward elimination ranking;classification accuracy;enhanced support vector decision function;features ranking;features selection;forward selection ranking;intrusion detection systems;support vector machines;testing time;training time,,6,,40,,,10-13 Jan. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks.

Many proposed schemes were presented recently, but none of which, employing separate system bus, have been proven experimentally as a potentially effective method for protecting the data stored in hard drives and removable disks. In our scheme, the system does not need to maintain any authentication mechanism or data integrity for the packets sent by any node, with a well-received attention towards threatening our valuable stored data.

This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into one modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. The architecture achieves roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern-matching engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA 10. KIDS core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties.

In this paper, we present a Policy-Based Network Security (PBNS) management approach for tactical MANETs. This approach leverages the DRAMA policy based network management system and the Smart Firewall system to meet the above requirement. It allows administrators to specify low-level network access control policies for each INFOCON level using high-level policies (adapted from the Smart Firewalls approach). The high-level policies are securely distributed to all the policy decision points in the network, which evaluate and enforce policies in a distributed manner. As a consequence of enforcing policies in response to INFOCON level changes, appropriate access control policies will be derived and applied to local firewall devices without human intervention.

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH.

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack.

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site.

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH.

This adaptive approach can overcome the limitations of traditional trust schemes, whereby the trusted operators are weighted manually or subjectively.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%.

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet.

Memory Protection through Dynamic Access Control,"Zhang, K.; Tao Zhang; Santosh Pande","Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA","Microarchitecture, 2006. MICRO-39. 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on",20061226,2006,,,123,134,"Current anomaly detection schemes focus on control flow monitoring. Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation. Thus, our major contribution is to provide an efficient scheme to detect data tampering while minimizing the overhead",1072-4451,0-7695-2732-9,,10.1109/MICRO.2006.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041841,,Access control;Degradation;Hardware;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Program processors;Protection;Runtime,authorisation;optimising compilers;program control structures;system monitoring,anomaly detection;control flow monitoring;data protection;data tampering;dynamic access control;intrusion detection;memory protection;microarchitecture;optimization;program compiler;program semantics,,2,,27,,,9-13 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

In this paper we present a flow based system to detect anomalous activity by using IP flow characteristics with chi-square detection mechanism. This system provides solution to identify anomalous activities like scan and flood attack by means of automatic behavior analysis of the network traffic and also give detailed information of attacker, victim, type and time of the attack which can be used for corresponding defense. Anomaly Detection capability of the proposed system is compared with SNORT Intrusion detection system and results prove the very high detection rate of the system over SNORT for different scan and flood attack.

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%.

SIDAN: A tool dedicated to software instrumentation for detecting attacks on non-control-data,"Demay, J.-C.; Totel, E.; Tronel, F.","SUPELEC, Rennes, France","Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS), 2009 Fourth International Conference on",20100217,2009,,,51,58,"Anomaly based intrusion detection systems rely on the build of a normal behavior model. When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution.

The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns.

However, the inherent nature of PCM technology does not align perfectly with either applications in terms of cost-per-bit, performance, power, endurance or retention. The missing killer applications for PCM have slowed down the technology development from becoming mainstream. From the systems perspective, the ever-growing big data problems call for a paradigm shift from traditional compute-centric system to data-centric system for better performance, efficiency and productivity. A data-centric system will demand new hardware features to support the efficient storage and manipulation of data in a wide range of data-intensive applications.

Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks.

Our aim is to develop such a system that operates on signatures extracted from execution profiles. These signatures are not descriptions of exploits, but instead are descriptions of the program conditions that lead to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, i.e., they depend on the structure of the vulnerabilities themselves. A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures.

Minos: Control Data Attack Prevention Orthogonal to Memory Model,"Crandall, J.R.; Chong, F.T.",University of California at Davis,"Microarchitecture, 2004.

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks.

In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server.

Nodes can change position quite frequently, which mean the mobility of the network. For quick data transmission, we need a routing protocol that adapts to topology changes. For our convenience, we have proposed a fast and secure protocol which is proactive and reactive in nature. In proactive protocol, routing table updates takes place when the topology changes. In routers that use dynamic routing protocols, it is important to have fast convergence because routers could make incorrect forwarding decisions until the network has fully converged. In proactive protocol, when a new node is added in the network it takes some time to converge during that time if we want to send data to destination through that new node immediately, it takes some time to converge and then it will transmit the data. To avoid this problem we are going to use reactive protocol instead of proactive in that time that is until network converge. In proactive protocol structure, we reduced the packet size and contains only limited field. By this, the total bit size gets reduced. We propose this mechanism to avoid waiting time and to transmit data as early as possible.

E-STAR combines payment and trust systems with a trust-based and energy-aware routing protocol. The payment system rewards the nodes that relay others' packets and charges those that send packets. The trust system evaluates the nodes' competence and reliability in relaying packets in terms of multi-dimensional trust values. The trust values are attached to the nodes' public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions. We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss of trust will result in loss of future earnings. Moreover, for the efficient implementation of the trust system, the trust values are computed by processing the payment receipts. Analytical results demonstrate that E-STAR can secure the payment and trust calculation without false accusations.

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.",,978-1-4799-3078-4,,10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318,Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security,Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security,computer network security,OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks,,0,,17,,,24-27 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A honeypot is an information system resource. It intentionally put in harm's way to be compromised by attackers.

Key infection: smart trust for smart dust,"Anderson, R.; Haowen Chan; Perrig, A.","Cambridge Univ., UK","Network Protocols, 2004. ICNP 2004. Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on",20041101,2004,,,206,215,"Future distributed systems may include large self-organizing networks of locally communicating sensor nodes, any small number of which may be subvened by an adversary. Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust.

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naive fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naive fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly.

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs).

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as virus free by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048  128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.",1522-8681,978-1-4673-5956-6,,10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172,,,CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data,NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability,,3,,28,,,19-22 May 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Moreover, SDN can facilitate the creation of new network applications that previously, with traditional networks, were more complex to be implemented. To illustrate the benefits of the use of SDN in SCADA, we designed a mechanism that aims to prevent a possible eavesdropper from fully capturing communication flows between SCADA components.

Improving Software Performance and Reliability with an Architecture-Based Self-Adaptive Framework,Xu Zhang; Chung-Horng Lung,"Dept. of Syst. & Comput.

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate to a dynamically changing environment. The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.",0730-3157,978-1-4244-7512-4,978-0-7695-4085-6,10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339,autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture,Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers,distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability,SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability,,0,,18,,,19-23 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path.

In this paper, we show that there is a rich set of covert communication channels available to attackers for use in coordinating large scale attacks against power grids. Specifically, we present PhyCo, a novel covert channel that leverages physical substrates, e.g., line loads, within a power system, to transmit information between compromised device controllers. Using PhyCo, two compromised controllers that are miles apart can coordinate their efforts by manipulating relays to modify the power network's topology. This can be done without requiring the use of any explicit communication channels, e.g., power line communications, and can evade intrusion detection sensors aimed at overt traffic.

MobiQuitous '09. 6th Annual International",20091110,2009,,,1,10,"The increasingly deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) challenge traditional network management systems because of the shared open medium and the varying channel conditions. There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.",,978-963-9799-59-2,,10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395,,Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol,fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN,IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications,,3,,34,,,13-16 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way.

While this flexibility is a boon for embedded system developers, who can now rapidly prototype and deploy solutions with performance approaching custom designs, this results in a system development methodology where functionality is stitched together from a variety of soft IP cores, often provided by multiple vendors with different levels of trust. Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing.

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas.

Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage. We use a sample case study of disaster recovery operations system to have a real scenario of mobile ad-hoc practice. An experiment is conducted using that scenario under different treatments. The contribution of our work is to suggest an intrusion detection model that is efficient but still reliable to use.",,978-1-4673-4527-9,,10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514283,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514283,,Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Power demand,computer network security;costing;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation,aggregative detection model;communication resource usage efficiency evaluation;cooperative detection model;disaster recovery operations system;intrusion detection system cost performance analysis;mobile wireless ad-hoc network;network security;power resource usage efficiency evaluation;wireless communication settings,,1,,14,,,22-23 Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels.

This paper presents a compiler-based solution to the notorious buffer overflow attack problem. Using this solution, users can prevent attackers from compromising their systems by changing the return address to execute injected code, which is the most common method used in buffer overflow attacks. Return address defender (RAD) is a simple compiler patch that automatically creates a safe area to store a copy of return addresses and automatically adds protection code into applications that it compiles to defend programs against buffer overflow attacks. Using it to protect a program does not need to modify the source code of the protected programs. Moreover, RAD does not change the layout of stack frames, so binary code it generated is compatible with existing libraries and other object files. Empirical performance measurements on a fully operational RAD prototype show that programs protected by RAD only experience a factor of between 1.01 to 1.31 slow-down.

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources.

A cooperative botnet profiling and detection in virtualized environment,"Shun-Wen Hsiao; Yi-Ning Chen; Sun, Y.S.; Meng Chang Chen","Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat.

Although numerous intrusion detection systems are available, yet it is not practical to install IDS in every virtual machine. In this paper, we argue that a virtual machine monitor (VMM) can support certain security functions that our proposed design can actively collect information directly from the VMM without installing an agent in the guest OS. In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the active detection agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs.

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on traditional graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-4148-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781,,Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic,cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic,,1,,21,,,Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2008.1,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182,Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity,,Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data,Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability,,12,,27,,2/2/2008,Jan.-March 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine
Energy-based adaptation in simulations of survivability of ad hoc communication,"Raciti, M.; Cucurull, J.; Nadjm-Tehrani, S.","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

We evaluated our system using anonymised traffic captured on an operator's network, and the results showed an improvement of 31% of malicious servers detected resulting from the collaboration, and this without significant performance impact and bandwidth overhead (respectively 4% and 11kb/s).",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679994,Bloom filters;Botnet detection;Collaborative detection;Domain-flux botnets;Inter-domain detection,Collaboration;Communities;Monitoring;Privacy;Probes;Servers;Vectors,computer network security;data privacy;groupware;invasive software;telecommunication traffic,anonymised information exchange;anonymised traffic;business preservation;centralized approach;collaborative approach;collaborative detection system;interdomain botnet detection system;large-scale network real time analysis;malicious server identification;privacy preservation,,0,,27,,,20-23 Oct. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user.

Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link.

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors.

When a node wishes to communicate with other node in the network, it invites all available nodes to participate in the routing mechanism; moreover, conventional routing protocols assume trusted co-operative environment. As a result, network layer of MANET is prone to various security attacks and therefore, finding a secure and efficient route becomes a major challenge.

Scalable Lookahead Regular Expression Detection System for Deep Packet Inspection,"Bando, M.; Artan, N.S.; Chao, H.J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Polytech. Inst. of New York Univ., Brooklyn, NY, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20120612,2012,20,3,699,714,"Regular expressions (RegExes) are widely used, yet their inherent complexity often limits the total number of RegExes that can be detected using a single chip for a reasonable throughput. This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes.

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation.

Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult.

Using the concepts from one-way hashing and language-derived relevance theory, we propose five novel contributions relevant to ad-hoc communications and security: one-way cryptographic hashing as a mechanism for securely communicating in an environment where preexisting shared knowledge exists, hashed shared knowledge messages as a basis for secure formation of self-selecting subgroups and trust building, adding salt to the shared knowledge hashes to remove the static nature of common messages and defend against precomputed table attacks, integration of variable complexity hash functions to dynamically adjust hash complexity relative to message complexity, and a message integrity element based on the secrecy of the original shared knowledge within a hashed message.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%.

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

Detection of Fraudulent Usage in Wireless Networks,Bo Sun; Yang Xiao; Ruhai Wang,"Lamar Univ., Beaumont","Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on",20071119,2007,56,6,3912,3923,"The complexity of cellular mobile systems renders prevention-based techniques not adequate to guard against all potential attacks. An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities. We simulate users' various behaviors and provide simulation results.",0018-9545,,,10.1109/TVT.2007.901875,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4356991,Bayes decision rule;Bayesian decision rule;instance based learning;instance-based learning (IBL);intrusion detection;wireless network,,belief networks;cellular radio;mobile radio;radio access networks;safety systems;security of data,Bayesian decision rule;Gaussian kernel;Parzen window;cellular mobile systems;class conditional probability density function;fraudulent usage;intrusion detection system;mobile telecommunication services;wireless networks,,6,,27,,,Nov. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations.

However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows.

The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it. This paper describes the hybrid firewall prototype with a focus on the software created to accelerate Netfilter with a network processor resident firewall.

This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic.

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. As part of an overall strategy for network resilience, a crucial requirement is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach via simulation of a resource starvation attack on an Internet Service Provider infrastructure.

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.",1533-2306,978-1-4577-1118-3,,10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830,RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks,,13,,28,,,28-31 Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

How dynamic is the ISPs address space? Towards internet-wide DHCP churn estimation,"Moura, G.C.M.; Ganan, C.; Lone, Q.; Poursaied, P.; Asghari, H.; van Eeten, M.","Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands","IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking), 2015",20150702,2015,,,1,9,"IP address counts are typically used as a surrogate metric for the number of hosts in a network, as in the case of ISP rankings based on botnet infected addresses. However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.",,,,10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335,,IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement,IP networks;Internet;invasive software,DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric,,0,,34,,,20-22 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.",,978-1-4799-7980-6,,10.1109/CSE.2014.125,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635,DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions,Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data,ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching,,0,,24,,,19-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance.

Robust and Scalable String Pattern Matching for Deep Packet Inspection on Multicore Processors,"Yang, Y.-H.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20130927,2013,24,11,2283,2292,"Conventionally, dictionary-based string pattern matching (SPM) has been implemented as Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA). Due to its large memory footprint, a large-dictionary AC-DFA can experience poor cache performance when matching against inputs with high match ratio on multicore processors. We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint. The B-NFA extends the matching to full dictionary lengths in a compact variable-stride branch data structure, accelerated by single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. A branch grafting mechanism is proposed to opportunistically advance the state of the H-DFA with the matching progress in the B-NFA. Compared with a fully populated AC-DFA, our HBFA prototype has <;1/5 construction time, requires <;1/20 runtime memory, and achieves 3x to 8x throughput when matching real-life large dictionaries against inputs with high match ratios.

Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic.

Dempster-Shafer evidence theory based trust management strategy against cooperative black hole attacks and gray hole attacks in MANETs,"Bo Yang; Yamamoto, R.; Tanaka, Y.","Global Inf. & Telecommun.

However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.",,978-89-968650-2-5,,10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177,Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management,Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security,cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security,Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism,,0,,11,,,16-19 Feb. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Characterization and analysis of dynamic parallelism in unstructured GPU applications,"Jin Wang; Yalamanchili, S.","Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","Workload Characterization (IISWC), 2014 IEEE International Symposium on",20141215,2014,,,51,60,"GPUs have been proven very effective for structured applications. However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead.

A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0430, Email: damon.mccoy@cs.colorado.edu","Networking Technologies for Software Define Radio Networks, 2007 2nd IEEE Workshop on",20071015,2007,,,48,54,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance, 2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses bad mouthing and 4) resists collusion.",,1-4244-1315-X,1-4244-1316-8,10.1109/SDRN.2007.4348973,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4348973,,Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Standards development;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML,,,,0,,22,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy.

This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards.

TFA: A Tunable Finite Automaton for Pattern Matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Yang Xu; Junchen Jiang; Rihua Wei; Yang Song; Chao, H.J.","Polytech.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778,Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion,Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management,finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data,Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton,,0,,25,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints such as network congestion, limited node energy levels, or non-cooperation of nodes might severely impact the performance and the robustness of existing planar graph routing variants. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We investigate basic schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network, and derive algorithms for routing and forwarding along these curves. We analytically prove that our scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery in arbitrary planar connected graphs.

Encryption cannot fully protect the data communicated between nodes, as routing information may expose the identities of the communicating nodes and put their relationships at risk. In this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous routing protocol that uses a mobile agent paradigm for wireless and mobile ad hoc networks.

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV.

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection.

Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique.

This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased.

This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.",,978-1-4244-6023-6,978-1-4244-6024-3,10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061,,Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn,Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing,Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs,,2,1,40,,,28-30 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads. We find (1) the load/store units can be the bottleneck of protocol processing; and (2) in connection establishing phase of TCP processing, cache contention between threads is more aggressive than any other phase.

This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits.

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696,Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority,Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks,,,,0,,22,,,26-28 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Such attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software to override its program control-flow and consequently invoke system calls, causing out-of-process damage. Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process.

All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection.

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks.

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace.

Sci., Acadia Univ., Wolfville, NS, Canada","Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on",20121016,2013,60,3,1089,1098,"The migration to wireless network from wired network has been a global trend in the past few decades. The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs.

Enhancing the pervasive trust management model in MANETs by analyzing the factors affecting performance of various attacks,"Durairajan, P.; Sasikala, T.","Sathyabama Univ., Chennai, India","Emerging Trends in Robotics and Communication Technologies (INTERACT), 2010 International Conference on",20110131,2010,,,115,120,"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) consists of a collection of wireless mobile hosts without the required intervention of any existing infrastructure or centralized access point such as base station. The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology.

Protecting Run-Time Filters for Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Valgenti, V.C.; Hai Sun; Min Sik Kim","Petabi, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA","Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA), 2014 IEEE 28th International Conference on",20140619,2014,,,116,122,"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) examine millions of network packets searching for malicious traffic. Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.",1550-445X,978-1-4799-3629-8,,10.1109/AINA.2014.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655,Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security,Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology,filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic,NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection,,0,,19,,,13-16 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program.

This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network.

A Scalable High-Performance Virus Detection Processor Against a Large Pattern Set for Embedded Network Security,Chieh-Jen Cheng; Chao-Ching Wang; Wei-Chun Ku; Tien-Fu Chen; Jinn-Shyan Wang,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Inf. Eng., Nat. Chung Cheng Univ., Chiayi, Taiwan","Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20120405,2012,20,5,841,854,"Contemporary network security applications generally require the ability to perform powerful pattern matching to protect against attacks such as viruses and spam. Traditional hardware solutions are intended for firewall routers. However, the solutions in the literature for firewalls are not scalable, and they do not address the difficulty of an antivirus with an ever-larger pattern set. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets.

DDoS-Shield: DDoS-Resilient Scheduling to Counter Application Layer Attacks,"Ranjan, S.; Swaminathan, R.; Uysal, M.; Nucci, A.; Knightly, E.",,"Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20090218,2009,17,1,26,39,"Countering distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is becoming ever more challenging with the vast resources and techniques increasingly available to attackers. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2008.926503,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692,Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring,,authorisation;security of data,DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service,,27,1,35,,7/2/2008,Feb. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Conservative vs. Optimistic Parallelization of Stateful Network Intrusion Detection,"Schuff, D.L.; Yung Ryn Choe; Pai, V.S.","Purdue Univ. West Lafayette, West Lafayette, IN","Performance Analysis of Systems and software, 2008. ISPASS 2008. IEEE International Symposium on",20080507,2008,,,32,43,"This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).",,978-1-4244-2232-6,978-1-4244-2233-3,10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736,,Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn,computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols,TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion,,4,,22,,,20-22 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification.

Early statistical anomaly intrusion detection of DOS attacks using MIB traffic parameters,"Jun Li; Manikopoulos, C.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society",20030923,2003,,,53,59,"We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a <sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background.

These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial.

The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion.

This security framework involves: detection of malicious nodes by the destination node, isolation of malicious nodes by discarding the path and prevention data packets by using dispersion techniques. We propose to develop a multipath reliable routing (MRR) algorithm, which determines a set of node-disjoint reliable paths. The paths are arranged in the descending order of their reliability index. Data packets are dispersed and transmitted simultaneously through the reliable disjoint paths. The primary reliable path sends the information packet containing the transmission information. At the destination, if there is mismatch between the transmission information and the data packets received, a negative feedback is sent back to the source that includes the particulars of the affected paths. The affected paths are then removed from the list of node-disjoint paths by the source. The destination can recover the data effectively by attaining reliability, since the data packets are dispersed along multiple paths using an efficient dispersion algorithm.

In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance. Our main result is the modeling of user activity on a computing system as a martingale and the subsequent quantification of the cost of performing a job to enable decision making",1060-9857,0-7695-1366-2,,10.1109/RELDIS.2001.969760,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969760,,Costs;Delay;Encapsulation;Fault detection;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal resolution;Wide area networks;Yarn,computer network management;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;safety systems;system recovery,active response;analytical framework;cost analysis;critical infrastructure protection;decision making;error detection;intrusion detection solutions;intrusion signaling;martingale;network information assurance analysts;real-time assessment scheme;reasoning framework;recovery thread;system activities;user activity modeling,,5,,15,,,2001,28 Oct 2001-31 Oct 2001,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets.

To provide situational awareness, detection systems usually employ (alert, priority) mappings that are either built in the IDS without consideration of the high-level mission objectives of the infrastructure, or manually defined by administrators through a time-consuming task that requires deep system-level expertise. In this paper, we present Seclius, an online security evaluation framework that translates low-level IDS alerts into a high-level system security measure and provides a ranking of past malicious events and affected system assets based on how crucial they are for the organization. Seclius significantly reduces human involvement by automatically learning system characteristics, providing a simple formalism that administrators can use to define security requirements.

IWCMC '08. International",20080815,2008,,,606,613,"While a variety of AIDS (anomaly-based intrusion detection system) are claimed to be fully distributed, lightweight, and ready for application, their detection cost are not always neglectable, especially when considering the fact that MANET nodes have scarce resources which usually impels them to avoid any unnecessary action. It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.",,978-1-4244-2201-2,978-1-4244-2202-9,10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004,,Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security,AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy,,1,,18,,,6-8 Aug. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall.

Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think,"Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.",,"Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,185,190,"A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.",,,,10.1109/SPW.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302,,Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches,Internet;finite state machines;protocols,FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications,,0,,9,,,17-18 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not penetrate hosts protected by ASA.",1751-8628,,,10.1049/iet-com.2011.0566,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219366,,,IP networks;access protocols;cache storage;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,ARP cache management;ARP protocols;UDP packets;Windows XP;address resolution protocol;agent software;antiARP spoofing agent;data link layer address;denial of service attacks;kernel ARP software;network layer address;user datagram protocol packets,,1,,,,,May 1 2012,,IET,IET Journals & Magazine

Effects of IDSs on the WSNs Lifetime: Evidence of the Need of New Approaches,"Doddapaneni, K.; Ever, E.; Gemikonakli, O.; Mostarda, L.; Navarra, A.","Sch. of Eng. &amp; Inf. Sci., Middlesex Univ., London, UK","Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom), 2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on",20120906,2012,,,907,912,"A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor environmental data such as temperature, humidity, light, speed and sound. WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected.

Tenth International Conference on",20020807,2001,,,159,165,"Since late 1999, DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack has drawn many attentions from both research and industry communities. Many potential solutions (e.g., ingress filtering, packet marking or tracing, and aggregate-based congestion control or rate limiting) have been proposed to handle this network bandwidth consumption attack. Among them, ICMP traceback (iTrace) is currently being considered as an industry standard by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). While the idea of iTrace is very clever, efficient, reasonably secure and practical, it suffers a serious statistic problem such that the chance for useful and valuable iTrace messages can be extremely small against various types of DDoS attacks. This implies that most of the network resources spent on generating and utilizing iTrace messages will be wasted. Therefore, we propose a simple enhancement called intention-driven iTrace, which conceptually introduces an extra bit in the routing and forwarding process. With the new intention-bit, it is shown that, through our simulation study, the performance of iTrace improves dramatically.

Stealthy Attacks in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks: Detection and Countermeasure,"Khalil, I.; Bagchi, S.","Coll. of Inf. Technol., United Arab Emirates Univ., Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110620,2011,10,8,1096,1112,"Stealthy packet dropping is a suite of four attacks-misrouting, power control, identity delegation, and colluding collision-that can be easily launched against multihop wireless ad hoc networks. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.249,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538,KeywordsLocal monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.,Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication,,6,,39,,12/30/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Sci., Univ. of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2011 IEEE Symposium on",20110818,2011,,,706,712,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become a hot research topic in recent years and are considered to be one of the building blocks of pervasive computing. Many diverse, mission-critical applications are deployed, including military, rescue, healthcare, factory floor, and smart homes. Security is a fundamental requirement in such sensitive applications in order to ensure their reliable and stable operation. However, security is a fairly difficult task to achieve. The open nature of the wireless communication, the unrestricted deployment and limitations of WSNs and the existence of a variety of attacks threaten the security of a sensor network. Currently, research efforts have mainly focused on developing prevention and intrusion detection mechanisms in WSNs. Intrusion recovery is also an important aspect of security provisioning that is not given the same attention. Researchers have proposed intrusion recovery protocols to restore the network's operation when an attack is detected. Their designs are mostly based on simplified threat models, making the intrusion recovery countermeasures vulnerable to advanced threat models. Although the network may recover its operation after an attack is detected, it does not mean that the threat is eliminated. For example, a persistent adversary can adapt his intrusion strategy to compromise the deployed recovery countermeasure. This research work evaluates the robustness and reliability of well-known recovery countermeasures in WSNs against persistent adversaries. Evaluation results have shown that existing intrusion recovery solutions are vulnerable and can be exploited under different attack strategies in order to compromise the applied recovery countermeasures, and thus the network.

Research has shown that the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable distributed application and devices to device communication, even on very resource constrained devices, and thus play an important role for IoT and CPS. In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured. Security mechanisms for resource constrained devices has attracted much interest from the academic community, where research groups have shown solutions like IPsec, VPN-tunnels, (D)TLS, etc. are feasible to use on this type of networks. However, even though the use of well-known security mechanisms are vital for SOA-based IoT/CPS networks and systems to be protected, they do not provide any fine-grain access control. In this paper, a CoAP-based framework for service-level access control on low-power devices is presented. The framework allows fine grain access control on a per service and method basis. For example, by using this approach a device can allow read/write access to its services to one group of users while only allowing read access to another group. Users without the right credentials are not even allowed to discover available services. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, several implementations are presented together with test results.

A Moderate to Robust Game Theoretical Model for Intrusion Detection in MANETs,"Otrok, H.; Mohammed, N.; Lingyu Wang; Debbabi, M.; Bhattacharya, P.","Concordia Inst. for Inf. Syst. Eng., Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC","Networking and Communications, 2008. WIMOB '08. IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing,",20081021,2008,,,608,612,"One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value.

These models have the following problems: bad real time capability, bottleneck, and single point of failure. In order to overcome these shortcomings of current intrusion detection techniques, a new distributed intrusion detection model based on mobile agent is proposed in this paper. Intelligent and mobile characteristics of the agent are used to make computing move to data. As mobile agent can only improve the structure of system and can not supply fundamental new detecting techniques, improved dynamic clonal selection algorithm and collaborative signal mechanism are adopted for reducing false positive rate and increasing detection rate in this paper. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm were simulated by KDDpsila99 datasets. Comparing with winning entry of KDDpsila99 classifier learning contest, the proposed model has low false positive rate and higher detection rate in both Dos and Probing attacks, and greatly higher detection rate in U2R attack. Robustness and dynamic adaptability of the system are validated.",,978-0-7695-3699-6,,10.1109/APCIP.2009.249,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5197236,dynamic clonal selection;intrusion detection system;mobile agent,Autonomous agents;Collaboration;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Detectors;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents,mobile agents;security of data,collaborative signal mechanism;distributed component;distributed intrusion detection model;dynamic clonal selection algorithm;immune mobile agent;intelligent agent;intrusion detection system;processing center,,0,,8,,,18-19 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Current implementations allow passengers to access Internet for pleasure and in some cases secure VPN access is provided to corporate networks. Several researchers are looking at the possibility of the existence of a total of three networks: passenger network (PN); crew network (CRN); and the control network (CON). Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks will co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN. The scope of this research is to determine the viability and need of a security mechanism.

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack.

Exploits are many times used by worms to fast propagate across the full Internet being Web servers one of their main targets. New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.",1060-9857,978-0-7695-3826-6,,10.1109/SRDS.2009.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421,exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware,Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server,Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security,HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit,,1,1,36,,,27-30 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks.

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN tunnel. To address this issue, we propose VGuard, a framework that allows a policy owner and a request owner to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy without the policy owner knowing the request and the request owner knowing the policy. We first present an efficient protocol, called Xhash, for oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, without disclosing their numbers to each other. Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of VGuard is to first convert a firewall policy to nonoverlapping numerical rules and then use Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. Comparing with the Cross-Domain Cooperative Firewall (CDCF) framework, which represents the state-of-the-art, VGuard is not only more secure but also orders of magnitude more efficient.

The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions.

In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic.

Malicious behavior may target the disruption of communications, infrastructure services, and applications. A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency.

To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.",,,,10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490,,Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks,,0,,21,,,29-31 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers.

The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade.

Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious. Some researchers have proposed detection mechanisms for the first type. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection method called delay per hop indication (DelPHI).

Improved TCAM-Based Pre-Filtering for Network Intrusion Detection Systems,Yeim-Kuan Chang; Ming-Li Tsai; Cheng-Chien Su,"Nat.

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent.

This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm.

Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory.

To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging.

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier.

This makes our solution capable of detecting known and unknown DoS attacks effectively by learning the patterns of legitimate network traffic only.

Securing the Internet routing infrastructure,"Papadimitratos, P.; Haas, Z.J.","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY, USA","Communications Magazine, IEEE",20021210,2002,40,10,60,68,"The unprecedented growth of the Internet over the last years, and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems, resulted in the Internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium. At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure.

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic.

Twenty-third AnnualJoint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies,20041122,2004,4,,2404,2413 vol.4,"Security is a critical issue in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security.

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.",,,,10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960,,Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology,computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols,6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats,,0,,,,,28-30 April 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Defeating Dynamic Data Kernel Rootkit Attacks via VMM-Based Guest-Transparent Monitoring,"Junghwan Rhee; Riley, R.; Dongyan Xu; Xuxian Jiang","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN","Availability, Reliability and Security, 2009. ARES '09. International Conference on",20090605,2009,,,74,81,"Targeting the operating system kernel, the core of trust in a system, kernel rootkits are able to compromise the entire system, placing it under malicious control, while eluding detection efforts. Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.",,978-1-4244-3572-2,978-0-7695-3564-7,10.1109/ARES.2009.116,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457,Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system,Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors,authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines,QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor,,8,4,27,,,16-19 March 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231,Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks,Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks,learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks,anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks,,35,,52,,6/10/2010,Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

MANET nodes operate in a decentralized trust no peer mode that complicates and inhibits security services, thus creating a formidable security challenge. Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a neighborhood watch concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it.

Decompression-free inspection: DPI for shared dictionary compression over HTTP,"Bremler-Barr, A.; David, S.T.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Interdiscipl. Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,1987,1995,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576,,Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers,Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols,Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression,,2,,25,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities.

To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way.

Single sign on (SSO) provides a convenient facility for managing user authentication such that a user only logs into a system once in order to gain access to many protected applications. For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the bad guys are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server.

We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN.

WSNs are usually composed of a large number of low power sensors. They require a careful consumption of the available energy in order to prolong the lifetime of the network. From the security point of view, the overhead added to standard protocols must be as light as possible according to the required security level. Starting from the DESERT tool (P. Inverardi et al., 2005) which has been proposed for component-based software architectures, we derive a new framework that permits to dynamically enforce a set of properties of the sensors behavior.

DBSCAN needs less knowledge of input parameters. Major advantage of DBSCAN is to identify arbitrary shape objects and removal of noise during the clustering process. Beside its familiarity, DBSCAN has problems with handling large databases and in worst case its complexity reaches to O(n<sup>2</sup>). Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm. We also compare these variations with one another to select the efficient algorithm. In most of the variations partitioning and hybrid methodologies are originated to deal DBSCAN problems.

The Fifth International Conference on",20060731,2006,,,152,159,"Network-based attacks can be either persistent or sporadic. Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance",,1-59593-334-4,,10.1109/IPSN.2006.244130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453,Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback,Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks,broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks,CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network,,4,,30,,,0-0 0,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
An Internet traffic analysis method with MapReduce,Youngseok Lee; Wonchul Kang; Hyeongu Son,"Chungnam Nat.

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host.

With the industry wide adaptation of service-oriented architecture (SOA), web services have become an integral component of enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges. Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant.

Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN.

GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic.

Organization cannot afford any kinds of attacks on their confidential information and resources either from insiders or out-siders. The damage done by insiders is more severe than that of external attackers due to their knowledge about the system and potential targets. It has been observed by studying previous case studies of insider attacks that insiders usually get involve in some unusual or suspicious activities prior to launching actual attacks. So observing these kinds of activities and taking proper actions in time may help to avoid such kinds of attacks. In this paper a risk assessment methodology has been presented to compute the threat levels of insiders. Appropriate actions may be taken by knowing about the threat level of each user in order to avoid actual attacks. The methodology not only incorporates technical measures but also some psychological indicators to detect insiders. The difference of this methodology from the previous ones is that it provides a practical way of quantization of risks for insider threats. The methodology is simulated in a test network against different scenarios and results showed that it efficiently categorized users according to their threat level. So it provides a base to deploy non uniform security policies among the users thus reducing overall processing overheads.,,978-1-4799-7504-4,,10.1109/FIT.2014.41,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118395,Insider;Organization;Risk;psychological;threat,Computers;Distance measurement;Monitoring;Organizations;Psychology;Security;Software,psychology;security of data,information misuse;insider threat;nonuniform security policy;psychological indicator;risk assessment,,0,,13,,,17-19 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique.

Their performance is judged by three criteria: query overhead, space requirement, and false positive ratio. Due to wide applicability, any improvement to the performance of Bloom filters can potentially have a broad impact in many areas of networking research. In this paper, we study Bloom-1, a data structure that performs membership check in one memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a standard Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g and Bloom-Q, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller or comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

Development of a Secure Traffic Analysis System to Trace Malicious Activities on Internal Networks,"Hirono, S.; Yamaguchi, Y.; Shimada, H.; Takakura, H.","Grad. Sch. of Inf.

By using a dedicated malware for evading detection at the initial attack, an attacker quietly succeeds in setting up a front-line base in the target organization. Communication between the attacker and the base adopts popular protocols to hide its existence. Because conventional countermeasures deployed on the boundary between the Internet and the internal network will not work adequately, monitoring on the internal network becomes indispensable. In this paper, we propose an integrated sandbox system that deploys a secure and transparent proxy to analyze internal malicious network traffic. The adoption of software defined networking technology makes it possible to redirect any internal traffic from/to a suspicious host to the system for an examination of its insidiousness. When our system finds malicious activity, the traffic is blocked. If the malicious traffic is regarded as mandatory, e.g., For controlled delivery, the system works as a transparent proxy to bypass it. For benign traffic, the system works as a transparent proxy, as well. If binary programs are found in traffic, they are automatically extracted and submitted to a malware analysis module of the sandbox.

Zebu: A Language-Based Approach for Network Protocol Message Processing,"Burgy, L.; Reveillere, L.; Lawall, J.; Muller, G.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20110728,2011,37,4,575,591,"A network application communicates with other applications according to a set of rules known as a protocol. This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.",0098-5589,,,10.1109/TSE.2010.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528,Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing,Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server,Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing,ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols,,5,,34,,6/17/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Enhanced side-channel analysis method to detect hardware virtualization based rootkits,"Kyte, I.; Zavarsky, P.; Lindskog, D.; Ruhl, R.","Wurldtech Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Internet Security (WorldCIS), 2012 World Congress on",20120823,2012,,,192,201,"This paper describes a method of detecting hardware virtualization based rootkits by performance benchmarking by detecting performance degradation caused by the hardware virtualization itself. The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence. That degradation must also be accurately measurable by a trusted and therefore external timing source. Accordingly, the benchmarking experiment that has been devised was performed using commodity hardware and freely available software, to determine which resources virtualization seems to degrade performance most significantly, and of these resources, which are most accurately timed externally. Although the results are preliminary, and strictly speaking, apply only to the actual hardware used in the experiment, they nonetheless show that there is potential to use passive network analysis to detect hardware based virtualization rootkits and associated malware.",,978-1-4673-1108-3,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280227,enhanced side-channel analysis;performance benchmarking;rootkit detection,Benchmark testing;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Timing;Virtual machine monitors,benchmark testing;invasive software;virtualisation,commodity hardware;freely available software;hardware virtualization;malware;performance benchmarking;performance degradation;rootkits;side-channel analysis method,,0,,21,,,10-12 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry.

We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier.

Another CDFA Based Multi-Pattern Matching Algorithm and Architecture for Packet Inspection,Tian Song; Dongsheng Wang,"Sch. of Comput.

This paper presents a method to optimize the potential memory usage of DFA based algorithms for multi-pattern expression matching by the combining DFA's paths, named isomorphic path combination (IMPC). To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA.

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.",1930-529X,1-4244-0356-1,1-4244-0357-X,10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932,,Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;invasive software,Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system,,0,,11,,,Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core.

That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population.

Signature Tree Generation for Polymorphic Worms,Yong Tang; Bin Xiao; Xicheng Lu,"Coll. of Comput., Nat.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined more specific relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2010.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493,Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation,,digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures,NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering,,7,,36,,6/17/2010,Apr-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

An energy-efficient anomaly detection approach for wireless sensor networks,"Ahmadi Livani, M.; Abadi, M.","Fac. of Electr. & Comput.

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.",,978-1-4244-8183-5,,10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031,energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network,Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks,principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks,WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks,,2,,14,,,4-6 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Massive Distributed DoS attacks have the potential to severely decrease backbone availability and can virtually detach a network from the Internet.

Harnessing the Power of P2P Systems for Fast Attack Signature Validation,"Antonatos, S.; Vu Quang Hieu","Inst. of Comput. Sci., Found. for Res. & Technol. Hellas, Heraklion, Greece","Network and System Security, 2009. NSS '09. Third International Conference on",20091110,2009,,,107,114,"Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.",,978-1-4244-5087-9,978-0-7695-3838-9,10.1109/NSS.2009.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955,P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation,Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing,P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm,,0,,14,,,19-21 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Attack diagnosis: throttling distributed denial-of-service attacks close to the attack sources,Ruiliang Chen; Jung-Min Park,"Bradley Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Virginia Polytech. Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, VA, USA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2005. ICCCN 2005. Proceedings. 14th International Conference on",20051031,2005,,,275,280,"Attack mitigation schemes actively throttle attack traffic generated in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.",1095-2055,0-7803-9428-3,,10.1109/ICCCN.2005.1523866,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523866,,Atherosclerosis;Computer crime;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic,IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services,DDoS attack;IP header;Internet protocol;PAD;Skitter Internet map;TTL field;attack diagnosis;attack mitigation scheme;counter-measure paradigm;distributed denial-of-service;global key distribution infrastructure;packet marking;parallel attack diagnosis;pushback marking;realistic network topology;transistor-transistor logic,,3,,17,,,17-19 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Specifically, by taking self-securing approach, the proposed protocol makes use of a localized trust model which allows users to get certificates and to perform authentication without requirement of any on-line trusted third party. Compared to other securing routing protocols, our solution eliminates the unrealistic assumption about the availability of on-line trusted authorities or certificate repositories, thus, it can take advantage of public-key technology to prevent many types of attack from malicious nodes.

Nevertheless, existing technologies are insufficient as primitives for end-host security. For example, Berkeley packet filter (BPF), the most popular monitoring infrastructure for many Unix systems, is intended for packet capturing at physical interfaces, and thus, not appropriate for monitoring of applications, which is sometimes critical for system security. This paper presents a simple solution to the problem, utilizing hierarchical virtual network interface (VIF) mechanism. VIF is a new OS abstraction that can be hierarchically structured and attached to OS entities to control their network I/O. We extend VIFs to allow filtering and monitoring of their traffic, and show that it has desirable properties for end-host monitoring and control of traffic.

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system.

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code.

Enhancing the Reliability and Security of the Information Infrastructure Used to Manage the Power System,"Cleveland, Frances","IEEE Member, PES-PSCC","Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2007. IEEE",20070723,2007,,,1,8,"In the power industry, the focus has been almost exclusively on implementing equipment that can keep the power system reliable. Until recently, communications and information flows have been considered of peripheral importance. However, increasingly the information infrastructure that supports the monitoring and control of the power system has come to be critical to the reliability of the power system. Communication protocols are one of the most critical parts of power system operations, responsible for retrieving information from field equipment and, vice versa, for sending control commands. Despite their key function, to-date these communication protocols have rarely incorporated any security measures, including security against inadvertent errors, power system equipment malfunctions, communications equipment failures, or deliberate sabotage. Since these protocols were very specialized, security by obscurity has been the primary approach. However, security by obscurity is no longer a valid concept. In particular, the electricity market is pressuring market participants to gain any edge they can. A tiny amount of information can turn a losing bid into a winning bid - or withholding that information from your competitor can make their winning bid into a losing bid. And the desire to disrupt power system operations can stem from careless mistakes, to simple teenager bravado, to competitive game-playing in the electrical marketplace, and even to actual terrorism. As the power industry relies increasingly on information to operate the power system, two infrastructures must now be managed: not only the power system infrastructure, but also the information infrastructure. The management of the power system infrastructure has become reliant on the information infrastructure as automation continues to replace manual operations, as market forces demand more accurate and timely information, and as the power system equipment ages. Therefore, the reliability of the power sys- - tem is increasingly affected by any problems that the information infrastructure might suffer.

The intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks may no longer be effective and sufficient when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network, thus existing methods of intrusion detection have to be modified and new methods have to be defined in order to work effectively and efficiency in this new network architecture.

The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads.

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops.

It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack.

Using parallel distributed reasoning for monitoring computing networks,"Musman, S.","MITRE Corp., McLean, VA, USA","MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2010 - MILCOM 2010",20110106,2010,,,417,422,"We describe a distributed reasoning system called Otto-Mate that is used to detect, reason about, and respond to incidents on a computing network. Events for monitoring computing networks occur at different system levels. Some information might relate to data, some might be operating system specific, some application or service related, some could be network related, and from each there will be compound events that describe incident effects and information about the situation context. All together there can be thousands of events per second. Today's approaches to monitoring networks are typically centralized, sending events over the network to a single engine for analysis. Centralized monitoring ultimately cannot scale to address the volume of events that one would ideally like to be able to monitor, so techniques of today often make severe compromises relating to the events that they ingest. Centralized monitoring creates a single point of failure and also generates significant network load. To overcome these deficiencies we have developed a more distributed, approach: our reasoner agents can (in theory) be installed on every monitored resources and the reasoner language (used for programming the reasoners) enables knowledge in a reasoner's working memory to be synchronized over multiple reasoners enabling them to implement parallel distributed reasoning algorithms that are able detect event patterns irrespective of whether the events are local or remote. Distributing the reasoning makes the system extremely resilient. Additionally, since the knowledge shared between the reasoning agents represents summary information, and because many on-line event correlation algorithms often suppress reporting once an incident has been reported, the amount of network load needed to support the distributed monitoring can actually be reduced. To demonstrate our approach we describe its application to the monitoring of a computing network that has been instrumented to protect it - - against 0-day email virus attacks.",2155-7578,978-1-4244-8178-1,,10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680347,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680347,autonomic response;distributed reasoning;event correlation;intelligent agents;network and security monitoring;parallel programs,Cognition;Correlation;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers;Viruses (medical),computer network security;computer viruses;electronic mail;inference mechanisms;parallel processing,Otto-Mate;computing networks;email virus attacks;operating system;parallel distributed reasoning algorithms;parallel distributed reasoning system;reasoner language;reasoning agents,,0,,11,,,Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

TRR dynamically and randomly relocates a program's stack, heap, shared libraries, and parts of its runtime control data structures inside the application memory address space. Making a program's memory layout different each time it runs foils the attacker's assumptions about the memory layout of the vulnerable program and makes the determination of critical address values difficult if not impossible. TRR is implemented by changing the Linux dynamic program loader, hence it is transparent to applications.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200,Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy,Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security,Internet;computer network security;data privacy,DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure,,0,,56,,2/10/2015,May-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Most of proposed solutions to counter packet dropping are either based on trust management or multipath routing, but no solution combines both trust management and multipath routing. Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a security framework which adapts security to the application requirements; evaluates trustworthy relationship based on localized trust model and efficiently combines multipath routing into trust management.

However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection. Our experiments show that the probability of a successful evasion is low, at about 0.98% in the worst case. We implement our approach in a prototype and present some preliminary results.

IEEE 34th Conference on",20091218,2009,,,899,906,"Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.",,978-1-4244-4488-5,978-1-4244-4487-8,10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038,,Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic,IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats,,0,,23,,,20-23 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls.

Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms.

The proposed system is designed to deal the fragmented and out-of-order packets. Fragmentation is the term given to the process of breaking down an IP datagram into smaller packets to be transmitted over different types of network media and then reassembling them at the other end. In most cases, depending upon the actual security device defending the network, there are typically multiple fragmentation techniques and packet size combinations capable of squeezing and exploiting protection device on a network. We present an efficient multi pattern algorithm for regular expression matching on streams with fragmented and out of order data, while maintaining a small state and without complete stream reconstruction.

Design and Implementation of a Fast Dynamic Packet Filter,Zhenyu Wu; Mengjun Xie; Haining Wang,"Dept. of Comput.

The key features of the Swift include: 1) extremely low filter update latency for dynamic packet filtering, and 2) gigabits-per-second high-speed packet processing. Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540,Linux kernel networking;packet filter,Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security,information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing,BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data,,0,,29,,2/24/2011,Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it.

Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection,Jiang Ming; Haibin Zhang; Debin Gao,"Coll. of Inf. Sci. & Technol., Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","Network and System Security (NSS), 2011 5th International Conference on",20111027,2011,,,25,32,"Anomaly detection has been attracting interests from researchers due to its advantage of being able to detect zero-day exploits. A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.",,978-1-4577-0458-1,,10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956,anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis,Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training,security of data,file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits,,2,,24,,,6-8 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Robot Coordination for Energy-Balanced Matching and Sequence Dispatch of Robots to Events,"Lukic, M.; Barnawi, A.; Stojmenovic, I.","Fac. of Tech.

We propose pairwise distance based matching algorithm (PDM) to eliminate long edges by pairwise exchanges between matching pairs. Our sequence dispatch algorithm (SQD) iteratively finds the closest event-robot pair, includes the event in dispatch schedule of the selected robot and updates its position accordingly. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding energy-balanced variants are obtained. We also present generalizations which handle multiple visits and timing constraints.

The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures.

Empirical results show that the PEG strategy can 1) achieve significant speedups on a state of the art multicore signal processor platform for static dataflow applications with predictable execution times,and 2) exceed classical scheduling speedups for application shaving execution times that can vary dynamically.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols.

In each stage, parallel SRAMs are used to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Transition rules can be efficiently stored and accessed in one cycle.

This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications.

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties.

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy.

Preservation of Security Configurations in the Cloud,"Eghtesadi, A.; Jarraya, Y.; Debbabi, M.; Pourzandi, M.","Comput. Security Lab., Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC, Canada","Cloud Engineering (IC2E), 2014 IEEE International Conference on",20140922,2014,,,17,26,"The dynamic and elastic nature of cloud computing introduces new security challenges when it comes to maintaining consistent security configurations. This is emphasized by the fact that virtual machines are abruptly migrated between physical hosts, in the same or even in different data centers under different security policies. If security is not correctly enforced at the destination locations, and not properly updated in the source locations, security of the migrating virtual machine as well as the co-located machines can be compromised. In this paper, we intend to tackle this problem, specifically for intrusion detection/prevention and VPN/IPsec as main security mechanisms. More precisely, we propose a systematic verification approach to check the compliance of security configurations. To this end, we first elaborate on two properties, namely intrusion monitoring configuration preservation and VPN/IPsec protection configuration preservation. Then, we derive a set of formulas that compare security configurations before and after migration. This allows reasoning on whether the aforementioned security properties hold. To this end, we encode these formulas as constraint satisfaction problems. The obtained constraints are then submitted to a constraint solver, namely Sugar, in order to verify the properties and to pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems.",,,,10.1109/IC2E.2014.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903454,Cloud Computing;Intrusion Detection;Security;VPN/IPsec;Verification,Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sugar;Virtual machining;Virtual private networks,cloud computing;computer centres;constraint satisfaction problems;security of data;virtual machines,VPN-IPsec protection configuration preservation;cloud computing;co-located machines;constraint satisfaction problems;data centers;intrusion monitoring configuration preservation;physical hosts;pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems;security configuration preservation;security mechanisms;security policies;security properties;systematic verification approach;virtual machines,,0,,26,,,11-14 March 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

On the other hand, we are witnessing an increasing number of zero day attacks. Our analysis confirms that Local Area Networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks since there is free communication between the hosts in the LAN. A single compromised host can severely degrade the services in the traditional LAN and it is extremely difficult task for the security administrator to determine the compromised host that is generating attack traffic. In this paper we propose techniques to enhance the security in traditional LAN by making use of the trusted computing and virtualisation technologies. Often virtualisation is considered as a technology which enables to run multiple computers on a single server. We will show that virtualisation technology has significant benefits even if a single virtual machine is hosted on each VMM. Our model enables the security administrator to enforce security policies on the traffic that can be placed on the LAN medium. Hence our model efficiently deals with the attack at the VMM that is hosting the compromised virtual machine. The security can be enhanced furthermore by using the TPM technology to secure the virtualized local area networks. We will also present detail analysis of different cases scenarios on how the proposed model can enhance the security of the local area networks. There are several advantages with our model.

Internet situation awareness can be accomplished by creating a common basis for private and public operators to monitor their networks. Thus, an overlay monitoring layer is needed, which can be utilized to address a very important aspect for a more secure and trustworthy Internet. This is the need of various stakeholders to have the information they need to perform their decision tasks in a reliable fashion. This can be accomplished by offering them a common smart approach and the additional benefit of a global view, which they can use to compare their local situation with. This smart approach should utilize well proven existing global statistics, best practices and existing technical sensors, which can be adapted to the overall common framework. From this, output for all relevant stakeholders, like national assessments centers, can be generated to fulfill the individual needs. One possible input source could be the technical sensor technology, which has been developed by our Institute for Internet security and which we give to partners and other researchers free of charge. It is a great basis for an Internet situation awareness, since it is a well proven system, which has been in operation for a couple of years, and since it can easily be adapted by our developers to comply with the overall framework.

For the ease of development, complex packet processing algorithms are often implemented at the user-space level. As a result, performance benchmarks for packet processing algorithms often show a great gap when packets are input from different sources. An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated. Experiments show that the proposed software architecture reduces 30% of CPU utilization.

We describe a protocol, named Reliability Map Routing (RMR), which uses end-to-end Quality of Service metrics that include spatial reliability and trust. The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance.

The outside attackers can be prevented with the help of an efficient key management protocol and cryptography. However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism.

This paper examines the spread of a class of hitlist-based worms that attempt to propagate by searching for address book files on the host system and using the host's mail program to spread to the addresses found. This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected. This paper provides a complete description of a method to allow for better containment of this class of worms.

This paper presents the design and implementation of DiMAPI, an application programming interface for distributed passive network monitoring. DiMAPI extends the notion of the network flow with the scope attribute, which enables flow creation and manipulation over a set of local and remote monitoring sensors. Experiments with a number of applications on top of DiMAPI show that it has reasonable performance, while the response latency is very close to the actual round trip time between the monitoring application and the monitoring sensors.

On the Detection of Signaling DoS Attacks on 3G Wireless Networks,"Lee, P.P.C.; Bu, T.; Woo, T.","Columbia Univ., New York",INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20070529,2007,,,1289,1297,"Third generation (3G) wireless networks based on the CDMA2000 and UMTS standards are now increasingly being deployed throughout the world. Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.",0743-166X,1-4244-1047-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735,,3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks,3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security,3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation,,18,1,28,,,6-12 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The efficiency of the trust evaluation process is largely governed by the trust derivation, as it dominates the overhead in the process, and performance of WSNs is particularly sensitive to overhead due to the limited bandwidth and power. This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.",,,,10.1109/EAIT.2014.24,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032,Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node,Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV,data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing,CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack,,0,,18,,,19-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency.

Misuse detectors attempt detection by matching the current system/user activity against known signatures and patterns. As opposed to this, anomaly detection works by developing a reference graph and comparing the ongoing activity against it. Any significant deviation is flagged as an intrusion. Anomaly detection is more promising because of its potential to detect unseen types of attacks. However, both techniques have conventionally relied on audit trails sampled deep inside the system via probes and the sheer size of the data allows only after-the-fact and off line detection. In recent past, there have been efforts to capture the semantics of system activity for more rapid detection and this can typically be done at levels closer to the user. In our earlier works related to this effort, we presented a scheme and a reasoning framework to detect intrusions based on the encapsulated user intent. This paper addresses the scalability and implementation aspects of the system by introducing concepts such as workspaces and meta-operations.

PEDA replays the has-been-infected execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead.

Both the malicious behaviors and the faulty behaviors are generally equally treated as misbehaviors without any further investigation by most of the traditional misbehavior detection mechanisms.

In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system.

Many recent new services are based on cloud environments, and a lot of people are using cloud networks. Since many diverse hosts and network configurations coexist in a cloud network, it is essential to protect each of them in the cloud network from threats. To do this, basically, we can employ existing network security devices, but applying them to a cloud network requires more considerations for its complexity, dynamism, and diversity. In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks.

An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers,"Danhua Guo; Bhuyan, L.N.; Bin Liu","Microsoft Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20121011,2012,20,5,1426,1439,"L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571,Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading,Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers,Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures,AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring,,1,,40,,12/12/2011,Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Augmenting Branch Predictor to Secure Program Execution,Yixin Shi; Gyungho Lee,"Univ. of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago","Dependable Systems and Networks, 2007. DSN '07. 37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on",20070716,2007,,,10,19,"Although there are various ways to exploit software vulnerabilities for malicious attacks, the attacks always result in unexpected behavior in program execution, deviating from what the programmer/user intends to do. Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.",,0-7695-2855-4,,10.1109/DSN.2007.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951,Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection,Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime,program diagnostics;program verification;security of data,branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism,,3,,29,,,25-28 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.",,,,10.1109/ARES.2013.42,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258,Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security,Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology,mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security,MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols,,1,,9,,,2-6 Sept. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead.

However, in the presence of attackers, reliable and trustworthy operations in such networks become impossible without securing routing protocols. In this paper, we target to study and design a secure routing protocol S-GyTAR for vehicular environments. Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator.

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host.

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination).

However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station.

These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then we construct the finite state machine (FSM) by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify every nodes behaviour by the FSM, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data.

The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS.

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance.

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high.

While these attacks are very simple in implementation, their effect on WiFi networks can be devastating. To this end, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed to detect these attacks. In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network. Results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against the different versions of the attack compared to Snort-Wireless and can achieve a detection rate in average 100% and a false positive rate in average 0.1%",,1-4244-0700-1,,10.1109/CISDA.2007.368156,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219103,,Computational intelligence;Data security;Detectors;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks,digital signatures;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless LAN,GP-based IDS;WiFi networks;data link layer attacks;deauthentication attack;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;intrusion detector;snort-wireless,,0,,16,,,1-5 April 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

However, because the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of moving more processing power into storage, this paper presents a novel idea to design an IDS on object-based storage devices (OSD), and analyzes how the features of OSD can be used for intrusion detection (ID) and for violation responding. Moreover, the existing OSD standard is enhanced to own the new functions. Compared with the existing research on block-level storage devices, OSD-based ID is more straightforward for implementation. We build such a prototype based on the OSD reference implementation provided by Intel.

In this paper, we identify that there are unique security challenges in a BV's different battery states. Accordingly, we propose a battery status-aware authentication scheme (BASA) to address the issue for V2G networks. In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator. In addition, we perform comprehensive security analysis, which shows that BASA achieves both privacy preservation and security protection during battery state transitions.

Di-Sec: A distributed security framework for heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Valero, M.; Sang Shin Jung; Uluagac, A.S.; Yingshu Li; Beyah, R.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Georgia State Univ., Atlanta, GA, USA","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,585,593,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are deployed for monitoring in a range of critical domains (e.g., health care, military, critical infrastructure). Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801,Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security,Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks,encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks,,6,,17,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks.

Yet, little work exists in actually implementing such schemes on small handheld devices.

Security features in the routing protocol include mechanisms for nonrepudiation and authentication, without relying on the availability of a certificate authority (CA) or a key distribution center (KDC). We present the design and implementation details of our system, the practical considerations involved, and how these mechanisms can be used to detect and thwart malicious attacks.

Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.",,0-7695-2567-9,,10.1109/ARES.2006.73,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320,,Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing,computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis,PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis,,6,,19,,,20-22 April 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Insider Attacker Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks,Fang Liu; Xiuzhen Cheng; Dechang Chen,"George Washington Univ., Washington",INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20070529,2007,,,1937,1945,"Though destructive to network functions, insider attackers are not detectable with only the classic cryptography-based techniques. Many mission-critic sensor network applications demand an effective, light, flexible algorithm for internal adversary identification with only localized information available. The insider attacker detection scheme proposed in this paper meets all the requirements by exploring the spatial correlation existent among the networking behaviors of sensors in close proximity. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities.

Many WSNs may incorporate several distinct message types of varying priority. A node with a high priority message to send may find the channel to be busy with a lesser priority message from another node and must therefore dasiaback-offpsila leading to further delays.

This autonomous topology of MANET makes it vulnerable against the internal attacks, such as black hole, wormhole, and flooding, from inside the system. One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed.

This is due to the inherent benefits of virtualization including fault tolerance through checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanisms. Because clouds are the abstraction of large data enters and large data enters have a higher potential for failure, it is imperative that a C/R mechanism for such an environment provide minimal latency as well as a small checkpoint file size. Recently, there has been much research into C/R with respect to virtual machines (VM) providing excellent solutions to reduce either checkpoint latency or checkpoint file size. However, these approaches do not provide both. This paper presents a method of check pointing VMs by utilizing virtual machine introspection (VMI). Through the usage of VMI, we are able to determine which pages of memory within the guest are used or free and are better able to reduce the amount of pages written to disk during a checkpoint. We have validated this work by using various benchmarks to measure the latency along with the checkpoint size. With respect to checkpoint file size, our approach results in file sizes within 24% or less of the actual used memory within the guest.

Combating persistent adversaries in wireless sensor networks using directional antennas,"Stavrou, E.; Pitsillides, A.","Dept. of Comput.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2.

Tampering with the kernel data is an attractive venue for rootkit writers since malicious modifications in the kernel are harder to identify compared to their user-level counterparts. So far however, the pattern followed for tampering is limited to hiding malicious objects in user-space. This involves manipulating a subset of kernel data structures that are related to intercepting user requests or affecting the user's view of the system. Hence, defense techniques are built around detecting such hiding behavior. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a new class of stealthy attacks that only exist in kernel space and do not employ any hiding techniques traditionally used by rootkits. These attacks are stealthy because the damage done to the system is not apparent to the user or intrusion detection systems installed on the system and are symbolic of a more systemic problem present throughout the kernel. Our goal in building these attack prototypes was to show that such attacks are not only realistic, but worse; they cannot be detected by the current generation of kernel integrity monitors, without prior knowledge of the attack signature.",1081-6011,0-7695-2848-1,,10.1109/SP.2007.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223229,,Computer architecture;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Detectors;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes,data integrity;data structures;invasive software;operating system kernels,attack signature;kernel code;kernel data structures;malicious modifications;stealthy attacks;systemic threats,,15,,18,,,20-23 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them.

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors.

A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance.

Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm is one of the well-known pattern matching techniques and it is intensively used in computer and network security. In order to meet the real-time performance requirements imposed on these security applications, developing a high-speed parallelization technique is essential for the AC algorithm. In this paper, we present a new memory efficient parallelization technique which efficiently places and caches the input text data and the reference data in the on-chip shared memories and texture caches of the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU).

In order to encourage selfish nodes to assume the leadership role, some form of incentive mechanism is required. We present an incentive-based leader selection mechanism in which incentives are incorporated in the form of credit transfer to the leader, which motivates nodes to compete with each other for assuming the leadership role. The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion.

Compromise of concentrators can be detected. The aggregated data is protected using Chameleon Signatures and then forwarded to the utility back-end for verification, accounting, and analysis.

By verifying that the Chameleon Hash Value of (m', r) and that the energy usage matches those aggregated by the concentrators, the utility back-end is convinced of the integrity and authenticity of the data from the smart meters.

"Semiautomatic security requirements engineering and evolution using decision documentation, heuristics, and user monitoring","Hesse, T.-M.; Gartner, S.; Roehm, T.; Paech, B.; Schneider, K.; Bruegge, B.","Inst. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany","Evolving Security and Privacy Requirements Engineering (ESPRE), 2014 IEEE 1st Workshop on",20140908,2014,,,1,6,"Security issues can have a significant negative impact on the business or reputation of an organization. In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically.

However, it is currently unknown how likely an IDS is to detect a given Internet-wide scan pattern and whether there exist sufficiently fast scan techniques that can remain virtually undetectable at large-scale. To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409,Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM),Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput,content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures,TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces,,0,,37,,7/22/2013,Jun-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy.

On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM.

We take benefit of the clustering concept in MANETs for the effective communication between nodes, where each cluster involves a number of member nodes and is managed by a cluster-head. It can be taken as an advantage in these battery and memory constrained networks for the purpose of intrusion detection, by separating tasks for the head and member nodes, at the same time providing opportunity for launching collaborative detection approach. The clustering schemes are generally used for the routing purposes to enhance the route efficiency.

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions.

As the action of intrusion represents variable, complicated, and uncertainty characteristic, they face so many problems to resolve for intrusion detection. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. We propose a hybrid IDS, which combines network and host IDS, with anomaly and misuse detection mode, utilizes auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and applies data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. We use an association rule to track all relevant data dependency rule sets for different access roles using a hierarchical structure. We identify malicious transactions from the transaction logs in the database using the data dependency rule sets. These rule sets are continuously updated and stored in a repository. The optimized algorithm actually improves the performance of IDS.

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions. Further, we have implemented a low-overhead TARF module in TinyOS; as demonstrated, this implementation can be incorporated into existing routing protocols with the least effort.

IEEE",20080502,2008,,,321,327,"Millions of users divulge their personal information on phishing web sites, which causes over a billion dollars loss every year. Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism.

The simulation results showed that the proposed mechanism is able to detect any number of attackers while keeping a reasonably low overhead in terms of network traffic.,,978-1-4244-8844-5,978-1-4244-8845-2,10.1109/ICCTD.2010.5646054,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5646054,IDS;MANETs;OLSR,Ad hoc networks;Artificial neural networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security,ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;safety systems,IDS;end-to-end communication;intrusion detection systems;misbehavior nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;optimized link state routing protocol,,0,,24,,,2-4 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Intrusion detection is an important security mechanism, but little effort has been directed towards efficient and effective architectures for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the context of MANETs. We investigate existing IDS architecture design issues, and propose a novel mobile agent based IDS architecture that has each node implementing basic IDS functions, while ranger agents roam the network executing more advanced IDS functions.

We design a novel secure routing protocol for MANETs. This protocol TAODV (Trusted AODV) extends the widely used AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) routing protocol and employs the idea of a trust model to protect routing behaviors in the network layer of MANETs. In the TAODV, trust among nodes is represented by opinion, which is an item derived from subjective logic. The opinions are dynamic and updated frequently as our protocol specification: if one node performs normal communications, its opinion from other nodes' points of view can be increased; otherwise, if one node performs some malicious behaviors, it is ultimately denied by the whole network. A trust recommendation mechanism is also designed to exchange trust information among nodes. The salient feature of TAODV is that, using trust relationships among nodes, there is no need for a node to request and verify certificates all the time. This greatly reduces the computation overheads. Meanwhile, with neighbors' trust recommendations, a node can make objective judgement about another node's trustworthiness to maintain the whole system at a certain security level.",1095-323X,0-7803-8155-6,,10.1109/AERO.2004.1367726,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1367726,,Ad hoc networks;Aerodynamics;Aerospace engineering;Computer science;Logic;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Routing protocols,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security,ad hoc on-demand distance vector;aerospace applications;certificate verification;military applications;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer protection;secure ad hoc networks;trust model based routing protocol;trust recommendation mechanism,,20,2,27,,,6-13 March 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module.

In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways. First of all, it provides a sophisticated language to describe multistep attacks in terms of states and transitions. In addition, the modular nature of the system supports the integrated analysis of network traffic sent to the server host, operating system-level audit data produced by the server host, and the access logs produced by the Web server.

Self-configuration enables the system to automatically configure security system and change the configuration of its resources and their operational policies at runtime in order to manage the system security. Our self-configuration approach is implemented using two software modules: component management interface (CMI) to specify the configuration and operational policies associated with each component that can be a hardware resource or a software component; and component runtime manager (CRM) that manages the component operations using the policies defined in CMI.

Biologically Inspired Anomaly Detection and Security Control Frameworks for Complex Heterogeneous Networks,"Hashim, F.; Munasinghe, K.S.; Jamalipour, A.","Sch. of Electr. & Inf.

This vision can be accomplished by integrating the existing and emerging access networks via a common Internet Protocol (IP) based platform. Nevertheless, owing to the inter-worked infrastructure, a malicious security threat in such a heterogeneous network is no more confined to its originating network domain, but can easily be propagated to other access networks. To address these security concerns, this paper proposes a biologically inspired security framework that governs the cooperation among network entities to identify security attacks, to perform security updates, and to inhibit attacks propagation in the heterogeneous network. The proposed framework incorporates two principal security components, in the form of anomaly detection framework and security control framework. Several plausible principles from two fields of biology, in particular the human immune system (HIS) and epidemiology have been adopted into the proposed security framework.

These packet inspections typically require considerable delay often consuming more than 70% of the IDS processing time. Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.",,978-1-4244-1513-7,978-1-4244-1513-7,10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922,Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber,Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design,,,,2,,14,,,29-31 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235,,Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols,Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes,DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol,,21,,15,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters,"Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on",20090127,2008,,,73,80,"PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors.

In fact, using open source web applications is a double-edged sword in that it supplies both attackers and defenders more control over their security aspect. Well-known attacks are aimed access resources that are not referenced by the web application and lead to information discloser. Inspired by the idea of a sniper lurking in the shadows of civilization as a secret guard, this paper proposes a framework-named Sniper-to improve the security of open source web applications. Mimicking a real sniper who hides in the bushes to watch and eliminate dangerous enemies, the proposed Sniper framework is hidden within the web application to capture potential attackers. To illustrate further, if an attacker approaches your website seeking sensitive data, Sniper will be there watching to detect the intrusion, notify the webmaster anonymously, and block the attacker based on predefined thresholds. Therefore, Sniper identifies and mitigates attack attempts ahead of time by monitoring suspicious traffic intended to reach forbidden or sensitive areas. Sniper was implemented and tested using three different open source web applications.

Suricata includes multi-threading to improve processing speed beyond Snort. Previous work comparing the two products has not used a real-world setting. We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its  backbone in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.",,978-1-4673-2708-4,,10.1109/THS.2012.6459829,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829,Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing,Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors,safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing,CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing,,1,,18,,,13-15 Nov. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The first technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood is within radio range of each other. The second technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes, in which each pair of nodes may not be in radio range of each other but where there is a node among them which has all the other nodes in its one-hop vicinity. Both techniques use message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks.

However, most existing network-based signatures are specific to exploit and can be easily evaded. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we structure existing botnet literature into three comprehensive taxonomies of botnet behavioral features, detection and defenses. This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy.

A Distributed Hierarchical Policy Management System for Security Control over Tactical Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Kirthika Parmeswaran; Coan, B.; Burns, Jim; Mouchtaris, P.; Lucas, Stephen W.",Telcordia Technologies,"Military Communications Conference, 2007. MILCOM 2007. IEEE",20080222,2007,,,1,9,"Tactical mobile ad hoc wireless networks can provide flexibility, agility, and mobility for dynamic network-centric warfare. They are designed to function without fixed infrastructure support. But, this design makes network security attacks hard to detect and control. For instance, an attacker could compromise one portion of the network by inducing a worm and then move to another portion of the network and replay the attack without being detected. In this paper, we describe a policy management system (PMS) that provides ubiquitous and consistent security policy control despite adverse conditions such as node mobility, node failures, network partitions, a compromise of the routing infrastructure, a high packet loss rate, and ongoing cyber attacks. We give performance results in a 47-node emulated network. Key challenges in tactical networks include a lossy environment with bit error rates as high as 0.001 and bandwidth as low as 500Kbits/s. TCP backs off in the face of packet loss and hence behaves poorly in such networks. Tactical network are also subject to cyber attacks that have the potential even to compromise the routing infrastructure. Our PMS architecture mitigates these issues by using a transport protocol that has two components, one oriented toward normal operation when the routing infrastructure is functioning and one oriented toward limited, but robust, operation even when the routing infrastructure has been compromised. In normal operation we use a reliable UDP protocol (RUDP) and in times of compromise we use a flooding protocol.",,978-1-4244-1513-7,978-1-4244-1513-7,10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455069,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455069,,Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Computer security;Control systems;Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Transport protocols;Wireless networks,,,,2,,13,,,29-31 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers.

We first refine the definition of maximal patterns given in (Wespi et al., 2000) and provide a pattern extraction algorithm to identify such maximal patterns. We then add one additional dimension to the problem domain by also taking into consideration the overlap relationship between patterns. We argue that an execution path of an application is usually not an arbitrary combination of various patterns; but rather, they overlap each other in some specific order. Such overlap relationship characterizes the normal behavior of the application. Finally, a novel pattern matching module is proposed to detect intrusions based on both intra-pattern and inter-pattern anomalies.

Application-level bugs are more frequent than kernel-level bugs, and, therefore, applications are often the means to compromise the security of a system. Detecting these attacks can be difficult, especially in the case of attacks that exploit application-logic errors. These attacks seldom exhibit characterizing patterns as in the case of buffer overflows and format string attacks. In addition, the data used by intrusion detection systems is either too low-level, as in the case of system calls, or incomplete, as in the case of syslog entries. This paper presents a technique to enforce nonbypassable, application-level auditing that does not require the recompilation of legacy systems. The technique is implemented as a kernel-level component, a privileged daemon, and an offline language tool. The technique uses binary rewriting to instrument applications so that meaningful and complete audit information can be extracted. This information is then matched against application-specific signatures to detect attacks that exploit application-logic errors.

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack.

Early work in MANET research has mainly focused on developing an efficient routing mechanism in such a highly dynamic and resource-constrained network. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. In MANET, routing attacks are particularly serious.

A high throughput string matching architecture for intrusion detection and prevention,"Lin Tan; Sherwood, T.","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings. 32nd International Symposium on",20050620,2005,,,112,122,"Network intrusion detection and prevention systems have emerged as one of the most effective ways of providing security to those connected to the network, and at the heart of almost every modern intrusion detection system is a string matching algorithm. String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule.

Based on such sensing relevancies, we propose an energy-efficient visual monitoring mechanism where the frequency of image snapshots transmitted by each source node will be a function of the monitoring relevance of the node for the application. Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level.

In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731,Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine,Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput,deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching,ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching,,1,,30,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

CTCP: a transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture for network security,Fu-Hau Hsu; Tzi-cker Chiueh,"Dept. of Comput.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches.

In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks.

DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.",1081-6011,0-7695-2339-0,,10.1109/SP.2005.1,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056,,Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring,automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data,IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm,,7,1,19,,,8-11 May 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

MILCOM 2008. IEEE",20090119,2008,,,1,7,"A variety of attacks on MANET routing, forwarding, and infrastructure protocols can only be detected using distributed cooperative algorithms. One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.",,978-1-4244-2676-8,978-1-4244-2677-5,10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175,,Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security,ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework,,5,,14,,,16-19 Nov. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks.

In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature.

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session.

Many intrusion detection systems have been proposed and most of them are tightly related to routing protocols, such as Watchdog/Pathrater and Routeguard. These solutions include two parts: intrusion detection (Watchdog) and response (Pathrater and Routeguard). Watchdog resides in each node and is based on overhearing. Through overhearing, each node can detect the malicious action of its neighbors and report other nodes. However, if the node that is overhearing and reporting itself is malicious, then it can cause serious impact on network performance. In this paper, we overcome the weakness of Watchdog and introduce our intrusion detection system called ExWatchdog. The main feature of the proposed system is its ability to discover malicious nodes which can partition the network by falsely reporting other nodes as misbehaving and then proceeds to protect the network.

Scalable NIDS via Negative Pattern Matching and Exclusive Pattern Matching,"Kai Zheng; Xin Zhang; Zhiping Cai; Wang, Z.; Baohua Yang","Res.

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152,,Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils,content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data,NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories,,1,,12,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Spoofing prevention using received signal strength for ZigBee-based home area networks,"Jokar, P.; Arianpoo, N.; Leung, V.C.M.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm), 2013 IEEE International Conference on",20131219,2013,,,438,443,"In this paper we present a novel spoofing prevention system (SPS) for ZigBee based home area networks (HANs) within smart grids. The proposed SPS uses the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) in order to detect attacks and filter malicious frames. The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead. The soundness of the proposed method is proved through both theoretical analysis, as well as experiments.",,,,10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687997,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687997,,Computer security;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Smart grids;Zigbee,Zigbee;computer network security,HAN;ZigBee based home area networks;attack prevention;dynamic threshold;malicious frames;novel spoofing prevention system;received signal strength;security center;smart grids;spoofing detection module;static threshold,,0,,14,,,21-24 Oct. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The marked information is used to reconstruct the IP address of the ingress router connected to the attack source at the detecting end. The work is deployed in the programmable routers in real time and the attack source detection mechanisms are carried out.

This programmability is typically achieved through software-programmable packet processing systems. One key concern with the proliferation of these programmable devices throughout the Internet is the potential impact of software vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely. We present a design and proof-of-concept implementation of a packet processing system that uses two security techniques to defend against potential attacks: a processing monitor is used to track operations on each processor core to detect attacks at the processing instruction level; an I/O monitor is used to track operations of the router to detect attacks at the protocol level.

Secure multiparty computation approaches provides a possible solution for computation time data protection, but are too costly (in communication) to be practical. In this paper, we design an adaptive multi-level secure computation algorithm with the goals of reducing the average communication overheads. The adaptive algorithm runs a less secure protocol to reduce the communication overhead when there is no threat. The system adapts to a more secure but less efficient protocol when security threat is detected. Thus, the system yields better performance at normal execution time while still assures security protection at the presence of security threats.",1521-9097,0-7695-2281-5,,10.1109/ICPADS.2005.69,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531105,,Communication system security;Computer science;Data security;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols;Scattering,information systems;protocols;security of data,adaptive multilevel secure computation;adaptive multiparty protocol;information systems;secure data protection;secure protocol,,2,,19,,,20-22 July 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Intrusion Detection System for Power-Aware OLSR,"Dutta, C.B.; Biswas, U.","Dept. of CSE, Univ. of Kalyani, Nadia, India","Computational Intelligence and Networks (CINE), 2015 International Conference on",20150305,2015,,,142,147,"Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) is a standard proactive routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). OLSR uses two kinds of the control messages: Hello and Topology Control (TC). As these messages are un-authenticated, OLSR is prone to several attacks namely, black hole, wormhole, Gray hole etc. This paper is focused at Sleep Deprivation Torture Attack on OLSR. Sleep deprivation attack is one of the most interesting attack in layer 2 where the attacker tries to use a low energy node until all its energy is exhausted and the node goes into permanent sleep. This attack is also possible in routing level. In OLSR low energy node declare their status through willingness property of HELLO message. Using this information an attacker node can choose that low energy node deliberately and forward all traffic through that node. This leads to low energy node in a permanent sleep mode.

In these mechanism IDS is used which detects malicious activities caused by malicious nodes, Based on the risk of attack, temporary decision is made whether isolation is needed or not. IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks.

Reduction of False Alarm Rate in Detecting Network Anomaly using Mahalanobis Distance and Similarity Measure,"Srinivasan, N.; Vaidehi, V.","Dept. of Inf. Technol., Anna Univ., Chennai","Signal Processing, Communications and Networking, 2007. ICSCN '07. International Conference on",20071105,2007,,,366,371,This paper discusses about a network anomaly detection system which is aimed at reduction of the number of false positives and negatives generated by conventional IDSs. A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack. This system is designed to be integrated into other detectors in order to mitigate false positive rates so that this enriches the chances of detecting zero-day worms and new attack exploits,,1-4244-0997-7,1-4244-0997-7,10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350764,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156646,,Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Phase detection;Phase measurement;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis,IDS;Mahalanobis distance;clustering phase;false alarm rate;incremental learning algorithm;network anomaly detection system;network traffic;statistical model;value-byte frequency,,0,,15,,,22-24 Feb. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A Lightweight Intrusion Detection Model Based on Feature Selection and Maximum Entropy Model,Yang Li; Bin-Xing Fang; You Chen; Li Guo,"Software Div., Chinese Acad. of Sci., Beijing","Communication Technology, 2006.

Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially NIDS (network intrusion detection system) examine all data features to detect intrusions. However, some of the features may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process and therefore they have great impact on the system performance. This paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model that is computationally efficient and effective based on feature selection and maximum entropy (ME) model. Firstly, the issue of identifying important input features is addressed. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, therefore results to faster and more accurate detection. Secondly, classic ME model is used to learn and detect intrusions using the selected important features.

Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata,"Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr. Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","INFOCOM, 2011 Proceedings IEEE",20110630,2011,,,1853,1861,"Regular expression matching (REM) with nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) can be computationally expensive when a large number of patterns are matched concurrently. On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(||p<sup>2</sup>(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where  is the alphabet and c  1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-9919-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986,Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching,NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,,11,,26,,,10-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

Distributed Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks: An Overlapping Coalition Formation Approach,"Tianyu Wang; Lingyang Song; Zhu Han; Saad, W.","State Key Lab. of Adv. Opt. Commun.

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.",0090-6778,,,10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693,Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing,Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors,cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection,cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user,,0,,37,,8/21/2014,Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Comparison of Two Intrusion Detection Schemes for Sparsely Connected Ad Hoc Networks,"Chuah, M.; Yang, P.","Dept. of Comput.

IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,7,"Several approaches have been proposed for intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks. Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks. Without the mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio with black hole attacks drops to 65.9%.

Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis.

Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes.

Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on.

Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack.

A new method for anomaly intrusion detection is proposed based on linear prediction and Markov chain model. Linear prediction is employed to extract features from system calls sequences of the privileged processes which are used to make up of the character database of those processes, and then the Markov chain model is founded based on those features.

Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20140227,2014,63,1,270,289,"This paper presents a new method, capable of automatically generating attacks on binary programs from software crashes. We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt.

Bayesian event classification for intrusion detection,"Kruegel, C.; Mutz, D.; Robertson, W.; Valeur, F.","Reliable Software Group, California Univ., Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual",20040108,2003,,,14,23,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information.

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.",1081-6011,0-7695-2136-3,,10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324,,Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing,authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security,Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis,,15,1,27,,,9-12 May 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

PsycoTrace: Virtual and Transparent Monitoring of a Process Self,"Baiardi, F.; Maggiari, D.; Sgandurra, D.; Tamberi, F.","Univ. di Pisa, Pisa","Parallel, Distributed and Network-based Processing, 2009 17th Euromicro International Conference on",20090508,2009,,,393,397,"PsycoTrace is a set of tools to protect a process P from attacks that alter P self as specified by its source code. P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions.

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of self-driving cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of connected vehicles (United States) or cooperative ITS (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems.

Malware Clearance for Secure Commitment of OS-Level Virtual Machines,Zhiyong Shan; Xin Wang; Tzi-Cker Chiueh,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20130307,2013,10,2,70,83,"A virtual machine(VM) can be simply created upon use and disposed upon the completion of the tasks or the detection of error. The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2012.88,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643,Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment,Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining,invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines,OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping,,1,,39,,11/30/2012,March-April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient.

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues.

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly).

Efficient fingerprint extraction for high performance Intrusion Detection System,"Haiyang Jiang; Gaogang Xie; Salamatian, K.","Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2013 IEEE Symposium on",20140306,2013,,,179,184,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) module in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) consists of two components: Pre-filter and Rule Verification (RV). Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.",,,,10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942,Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort,Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV,feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data,MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component,,0,,19,,,7-10 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

When implemented successfully, attackers assume the identity of the compromised user, enjoying the same access to resources as the compromised user. Network protocols like FTP, Telnet, and rlogin are especially attractive to the attacker, because of the session oriented nature of their connections, and lack of implementation of any security during login, authentication, or data transmission.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths.

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection. VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored.

However, the extraction of flow features is difficult due to the increasing line rates, a broad range of network protocols, and a variety of complex flow features.

Advanced algorithms for fast and scalable deep packet inspection,"Kumar, S.; Turner, J.; Williams, J.","Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO","Architecture for Networking and Communications systems, 2006. ANCS 2006. ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20080725,2006,,,81,92,"Modern deep packet inspection systems use regular expressions to define various patterns of interest in network data streams. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a content-less identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD<sup>2</sup>FAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.",,978-1-59593-580-9,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579526,DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions,Added delay;Automata;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Information security;Inspection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Permission;Throughput,computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;grammars;storage management,content addressed delayed input;content addressing;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;expression representation;memory access;network applications;network data streams;regular expression parsing;state traversal process;table compression,,15,2,34,,,3-5 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time.

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos.

Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis.

Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes.

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.",,978-1-4244-8335-8,978-0-7695-4214-0,10.1109/HPCC.2010.120,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281,Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy,,security of data;sensor fusion,Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system,,4,,28,,,1-3 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language.

In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements.

IEEE 6th International Conference on",20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",,978-1-4244-5113-5,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks.

In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true).

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior.

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets.

During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison.

Dept., Macquarie Univ., Sydney, NSW","Engineering of Complex Computer Systems, 2009 14th IEEE International Conference on",20090623,2009,,,202,209,"In this paper we propose a dynamically invoked service based access control (SBAC) model to efficiently deal with the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The main idea of the SBAC is based on the observation that if the routers have information about the services that are running on the end host and can identify the upper layer traffic from the IP packet payload, then it becomes easy to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic for that particular victim server. To minimise the overhead on the routers, the SBAC model is invoked during the attack times only and the victimpsilas traffic is processed separately. The boundary routers in SBAC model validate each incoming packet to the victim on a per server basis. Only the packets that are considered to be accessing the legitimate services are passed and the remaining packets are dropped. Hence, at this stage the victimpsilas network is immune to any dynamic changes in attack pattern if the attack packets are not accessing the legitimate services at the victim end. The packets that are considered to be accessing legitimate services of the victim machine/network are marked with a unique ID and destined to the victim. If any of the received packets are found to be malicious, the unique ID enables the victim to identify service specific attack signature for each ingress SBAC router and prevent the attack traffic at that particular router. We will also discuss how the SBAC model deals with attacks on the infrastructure of the autonomous system.",,978-0-7695-3702-3,,10.1109/ICECCS.2009.43,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090528,Access control;Autonomous System;Denial of Service;Traceback,Access control;Computer crime;Computer network management;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Reflection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services,IP networks;Internet;authorisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,DDoS attack;IP packet payload;Internet;SBAC router model;autonomous system;distributed denial of service attack;legitimate service;malicious attack traffic;service-based access control model,,4,,30,,,2-4 June 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A range of symmetric-key distribution protocols exist, but these protocols do not scale effectively to large sensor networks.

We describe peer intermediaries for key establishment (PIKE), a class of key-establishment protocols that involves using one or more sensor nodes as a trusted intermediary to facilitate key establishment.

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic.

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools.

Traffic flow management in next generation service provider networks  Are we there yet?,"Goss, R.; Botha, R.","Inst. for ICT Advancement, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ., Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Information Security South Africa (ISSA), 2011",20110926,2011,,,1,6,"For years a number of savvy Internet users have avoided firewalls and traffic engineering measures by directing traffic through ports seemingly unrelated to the application. These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as safe or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks.

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security.

A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks,"Nogueira, A.; Salvador, P.; Blessa, F.","Inst. de Telecomun., Univ. of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal","Digital Telecommunications (ICDT), 2010 Fifth International Conference on",20100729,2010,,,57,62,"A concerted fight against botnets is needed in order to avoid them from becoming a serious threat to global security in the forthcoming years. Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.",,978-1-4244-7271-0,,10.1109/ICDT.2010.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380,Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile,Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic,,,,3,,20,,,13-19 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy.

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy",,0-7803-9788-6,,10.1109/IRI.2006.252413,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490,,Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks,data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN,clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN,,1,,15,,,16-18 Sept. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes.

Matching a Set of Patterns with Wildcards,Meng Zhang; Yi Zhang; Jijun Tang,"Coll. of Comput.

This problem arises in various fields, such as computational biology and network security. But the problem is not extensively studied as the single pattern case and there is no efficient algorithm for this problem. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms. Let P = {p<sub>1</sub>, . . . , p<sub>k</sub>} be a set of patterns with wildcards where the total length of patterns is |P|, and a text t of length n over alphabet a1 , . . . ,a<sub></sub>. We present two algorithms for this problem where patterns are matched simultaneously. The first algorithm finds the matches of a small set of patterns in the text in O(n log |P| + nk) time. The words used in the algorithm are of size k[2 lg ] + X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> Ig |p<sub>i</sub>| bits. The second one finds the matchings of patterns in the text in time O(n log |P| log  + nk) by computing the Hamming distance between the patterns and the text. The algorithm uses the words with X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> lg |p<sub>i</sub>| bits.

In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain.

This method is energy inefficient because all nodes have to receive and forward the alarm packet so as to exhaust communication bandwidth and node energy, especially when there are a large number of sensor nodes in the network. This paper develops an energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism in WSNs called green firewall. It can isolate an intruder with less overhead, and track the intruder to continually prevent the attack.

In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489,Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability,Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software,computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines,VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty,,1,,48,,,Jan-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis.

Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients.

In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes.

An Efficient Task Allocation Protocol for P2P Multi-agent Systems,Dayong Ye; Quan Bai; Minjie Zhang; Khin Than Win; Zhiqi Shen,"Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Software Eng., Univ. of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia","Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, 2009 IEEE International Symposium on",20090818,2009,,,11,18,"Recently, task allocation in multi-agent systems has been investigated by many researchers. Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.",,978-0-7695-3747-4,,10.1109/ISPA.2009.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966,,Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness,multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation,P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment,,2,,16,,,10-12 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns.

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.",,978-1-4244-4153-2,978-0-7695-3650-7,10.1109/MDM.2009.22,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926,,Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise,ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling,Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security,,9,,41,,,18-20 May 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security.

To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature.

A Multi-dimensional Progressive Perfect Hashing for High-Speed String Matching,"Yang Xu; Lei Ma; Zhaobo Liu; Chao, H.J.","ECE Dept., NYU, Brooklyn, NY, USA","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2011 Seventh ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20111031,2011,,,167,177,"Aho-Corasick (AC) automaton is widely used for multi-string matching in today's Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton.

It is important to properly handle network and Web database security issues including authentication, denial of service, and fine-grained access control. When database access control and the network security are addressed separately, the security systems are not optimized sufficiently as a whole. This paper propose a method of integrating network security with criterion based access control to handle network security and the fine-grained Web database access control simultaneously. To improve efficiency, the model adopts two step access controls.

PRDC '09. 15th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on",20091231,2009,,,127,134,"The problem of previous approaches in anomaly detection in intrusion detection system (IDS) is to provide only binary detection result; intrusion or normal. This is a main cause of high false rates and inaccurate detection rates in IDS. In this paper, we propose a new approach named quantitative intrusion intensity assessment (QIIA). QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

Eagle Eyes: Protocol Independent Packet Marking Scheme to Filter Attack Packets and Reduce Collateral Damage During Flooding Based DoS and DDoS Attacks,"Saurabh, S.; Sairam, A.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Indian Inst. of Technol. Patna, Patna, India","Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT), 2012 Third International Conference on",20130110,2012,,,141,146,"Defences against Denial and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks commonly responds to flooding by dropping excess traffic. Such rate limiting schemes drop all excess-traffic when the request arrival rate goes above a certain empirically calculated threshold. Flooding based DoS/DDoS attacks like TCP SYN Attack does not exhibit any special signature except that their arrival-rate is high enough to overwhelm the victim. Hence it is very difficult to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic as they share the same signature. As a result, rate limiting schemes cause heavy collateral damage by dropping out legitimate traffic [15]. In this paper we propose a novel packet marking mechanism which not only mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by filtering but also reduces collateral damage significantly by selectively dropping attack packets based on its packet mark while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed smoothly. Our packet mark contains fingerprint of the path in each single packet which allows us in identifying attack packets coming from various sources even in case of IP spoofing. Our scheme does not require any protocol specific knowledge and can generically filter out attack packets for all kinds of flooding attacks. We have extensively evaluated our packet marking scheme. Results show effectiveness of our scheme in filtering attack traffic. Our scheme inflicts extremely low collateral damage to legitimate traffic while quickly detecting and selectively filtering attack traffic.",,978-1-4673-3149-4,,10.1109/ICCCT.2012.35,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394683,Anomaly Detection;DDoS;TCP SYN Attack;collateral damage;packet marking;selective filtering,Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Limiting;Routing;Servers;Topology,IP networks;computer network security;protocols;telecommunication traffic,Eagle Eyes;IP spoofing;TCP SYN attack;attack packet filtering;attack traffic filtering;collateral damage reduction;distributed denial of service attacks;dropping attack packets;excess traffic dropping;flooding based DDoS Attacks;protocol independent packet marking scheme;rate limiting schemes,,0,,18,,,23-25 Nov. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
