A Bray-Curtis Weighted Automaton for Detecting Malicious Code Through System-Call Analysis,"Pungila, C.","Comput. Sci. Dept., West Univ. of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania","Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC), 2009 11th International Symposium on",20100506,2009,,,392,400,"Malicious code detection is one of the top subjects of interest for intrusion detection systems in today's computer security research areas. In this paper we propose a new heuristic method for detecting malicious code through system call matching, which also takes in consideration the time of the system call, by using an adaptive search for an extended Aho-Corasick automaton supporting a subset of the regular expressions language, through the use of a normalization technique known as the Bray-Curtis (Sorensen) distance. We will also discuss how this technique can be applied to enrich the set of existing rules from the knowledge base for improving the detection rate.",,978-1-4244-5910-0,978-1-4244-5911-7,10.1109/SYNASC.2009.41,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460823,Aho-Corasick automata;Bray-Curtis distance;Sorensen distance;dynamic analysis;intrusion detection system;malicious code detection;normalization;static analysis;system call timing,Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Scientific computing;Viruses (medical),automata theory;formal languages;security of data,Aho-Corasick automaton;Bray-Curtis distance;Bray-Curtis weighted automaton;Sorensen distance;computer security;detection rate;intrusion detection;knowledge base;malicious code detection;normalization technique;regular expression language;system call matching;system call time;system-call analysis,,1,,23,,,26-29 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Pre-decoded CAMs for efficient and high-speed NIDS pattern matching,"Sourdis, I.; Pnevmatikatos, D.","Dept. of Electron. & Comput. Eng., Crete Tech.

FCCM 2004. 12th Annual IEEE Symposium on",20041213,2004,,,258,267,"In this paper we advocate the use of pre-decoding for CAM-based pattern matching. We implement an FPGA based sub-system for NIDS (Snort) pattern matching using a combination of techniques. First, we reduce the area cost of character matching using (i) character pre-decoding before they are compared in the CAM line, and (ii) efficient shift register implementation using the SRL16 Xilinx cell. Then we achieve high operating frequencies by (iii) using ne grain pipelining for faster circuits and (iv) decoupling the data distribution network from the processing components. Our results show that for matching more than 18,000 characters (the entire SNORT rule set) our implementation requires an area cost of less than 1.1 logic cells per matched character, achieving an operating frequency of about 375 MHz (3 Gbps) on a Virtex2 device. When using quad parallelism to increase the matching throughput, the area cost of a single matched character is reduced to less than one logic cell for a throughput of almost 10 Gbps.",,0-7695-2230-0,,10.1109/FCCM.2004.46,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1364636,,CADCAM;Cams;Computer aided manufacturing;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Logic devices;Pattern matching;Throughput,content-addressable storage;decoding;field programmable gate arrays;memory architecture;security of data;shift registers;string matching,CAM based pattern matching;FPGA based subsystem;SRL16 Xilinx cell;Snort rule set;Virtex2 device;character matching;character predecoding;data distribution network;faster circuits;grain pipelining;network intrusion detection system;predecoded CAM;processing components;shift register,,84,2,16,,,20-23 April 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This article explores architectural and software support for an efficient programmable 10 Gigabit Ethernet controller. The design is then extended to support a self-securing Gigabit Ethernet controller that performs intrusion detection on all network data frames. Both raw performance and security require high- bitrate frame data transfer, low-latency metadata access, and intensive computational capacity while still operating under the area, cost, and power budget of a peripheral device. These goals are achieved using a combination of parallel lightweight processing cores, an explicitly-partitioned memory system, and dedicated hardware assists.

The performance gap between the execution speed of security software and the amount of data to be processed is ever widening. A common solution to close this performance gap is through hardware implementation of security functions. Possessing the flexibility of software and high parallelism of hardware, reconfigurable hardware devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), have become increasingly popular for this purpose. FPGAs support the performance demands of security operations as well as enable architectural and algorithm innovations in the future.

Optimization of Massive Pattern Queries by Dynamic Configuration Morphing,"Laptev, N.; Zaniolo, C.","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Data Engineering (ICDE), 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on",20120702,2012,,,917,928,"Complex pattern queries play a critical role in many applications that must efficiently search databases and data streams. Current techniques support the search for multiple patterns using deterministic or non-deterministic automata. In practice however, the static pattern representation does not fully utilize available system resources, subsequently suffering from poor performance. Therefore a low overhead auto-reconfigurable automaton is needed that optimizes pattern matching performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration. This is accomplished only with a modest increase in amortized memory usage.",1063-6382,978-1-4673-0042-1,,10.1109/ICDE.2012.52,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228144,,Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Dynamic scheduling;Engines;Equations;Optimization;Pattern matching,data structures;deterministic automata;pattern matching;query processing,autoreconfigurable automaton;data stream;database searching;deterministic automata;dynamic automaton reconfiguration;dynamic configuration morphing;massive pattern query optimization;nondeterministic automata;pattern matching;query pattern representation;resource constrained system;static pattern representation,,1,,29,,,1-5 April 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
