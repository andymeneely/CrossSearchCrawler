Anomaly Detection on Intrusion Detection System Using CLIQUE Partitioning,"Nastaiinullah, N.; Adiwijaya; Kurniati, A.P.","Telkom Univ., Bandung, Indonesia","Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT), 2014 2nd International Conference on",20141002,2014,,,7,12,"The development of information and network technology makes network security become important. Intrusion is one of the issues in network security. To prevent intrusion happens, intrusion detection system (IDS) is built. One of IDS category is anomaly detection. This category detects intrusion event based on data profile. Clustering is one way to observe data profile. There are a lot of clustering algorithms proposed for anomaly detection on IDS, but most of them find clusters in the highest dimension of data. CLIQUE Partitioning (CP) is one of the clustering algorithm that can find clusters from the subspace of data. Testing is done to analyze system's performance based on computational time, completeness, and false alarm rate. CP algorithm shows good performance from completeness point of view (94.59%) and false alarm rate (2.54%). From computational time, CP shows good performance based on the amount of tuple, but the performance is not too good from the quantity of feature side.",,,,10.1109/ICoICT.2014.6914031,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914031,CLIQUE Partitioning;IDS;anomaly detection;cluster;subspace,Cleaning;Clustering algorithms;Data preprocessing;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis,data mining;pattern clustering;security of data,CLIQUE partitioning;IDS;anomaly detection;clustering algorithm;false alarm rate;intrusion detection system;network security,,0,,17,,,28-30 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Exhaust: Optimizing Wu-Manber pattern matching for intrusion detection using Bloom filters,"Aldwairi, M.; Al-Khamaiseh, K.","Coll. of Technol.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.",,978-1-4799-8171-7,,10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081,Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber,Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads,data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data,Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems,,0,,19,,,21-23 March 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest. While developing a client-server application, the communication between client and database server becomes imperative. This paper discusses detailed analysis for choosing appropriate type of web service, data exchange protocols, data exchange format, and Mobile positioning technologies for client-server application. It also highlights issues like memory capacity, security, poor response time, and battery consumption in mobile devices.

A numerical micro-scale model is developed to study the behavior of dendrite growth in presence of melt convection. In this method, an explicit, coupled enthalpy model is used to simulate the growth of an equiaxed dendrite, while a Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to track the movement of the dendrite in the convecting melt in a two-dimensional Eulerian framework. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the enthalpy model in simulating the dendritic growth involving complex shape, and the accuracy of VOF method in conserving mass and preserving the complex dendritic shape during motion. Simulations are performed in presence of uniform melt flow for both fixed and moving dendrites, and the difference in dendrite morphology is shown.",,0-7803-9311-2,,10.1109/TENCON.2005.301288,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085379,,Abstracts,,,,0,,,,,21-24 Nov. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

One of the biggest trends has been social media services such as Facebook and Twitter. Although social media is the major trend, it is not the only one. Cloud computing has made a large impact on the computing industry in recent years. Whether being utilized to provide highly scalable robust environments for applications or just being used as a marketing ploy, one thing is certain: cloud computing has the potential to yet again change the way we interact with computer systems. There is just one major factor separating cloud computing from becoming widely accepted both personally and commercially and that is security. As cloud systems re-innovate ways of request distribution and load balancing, it is important to test these systems against attacks such as the denial of service attack. There is a strong emphasis on researching these attacks since cloud computing is re-inventing the payment systems in which consumers utilize resources. This paper examines the Google App Engine and its resilience to denial of service attacks.

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching.

Unfortunately, developing sound, reliable security mechanisms is a non-trivial task, and a history of vulnerable and/or incomplete implementations of these mechanisms led to the idea that mobile code systems are inherently insecure, too complex, and very difficult to deploy. To overcome these problems, we developed a mobile code system that relies as much as possible on the security mechanisms already provided by the underlying operating system. By doing this, it is possible to develop, with reduced effort, security services that rely on well-known, well-understood, and well-tested security mechanisms.

Since software implementation may not keep pace with the high-speed demand, turning to hardware-based solutions becomes promising. This work presents an innovative architecture to realize string matching in sub-linear time based on algorithmic heuristics, which come from parallel queries to a set of space-efficient Bloom filters. The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module.

Sub sequently, GAIS utilizes this probabilistic model for sampling new solutions. Thus, the algorithm takes into account the relationships among the variables of the problem, avoiding the disruption of already obtained high-quality partial solutions (building blocks). Besides the capability to identify and manipulate building blocks, the algorithm maintains diversity in the population, performs multimodal optimization and adjusts the size of the population automatically according to the problem. These attributes are generally absent from alternative algorithms, and all were shown to be useful attributes when optimizing the weights of MLPs, thus guiding to high-performance classifiers.

Fast Activity Detection: Indexing for Temporal Stochastic Automaton-Based Activity Models,"Albanese, M.; Pugliese, A.; Subrahmanian, V.S.","Dept. of Appl. Inf. Technol. & the Center for Secure Inf. Syst., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20121220,2013,25,2,360,373,"Today, numerous applications require the ability to monitor a continuous stream of fine-grained data for the occurrence of certain high-level activities. A number of computerized systems-including ATM networks, web servers, and intrusion detection systems-systematically track every atomic action we perform, thus generating massive streams of timestamped observation data, possibly from multiple concurrent activities. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently detecting occurrences of high-level activities from such interleaved data streams. A solution to this important problem would greatly benefit a broad range of applications, including fraud detection, video surveillance, and cyber security. There has been extensive work in the last few years on modeling activities using probabilistic models. In this paper, we propose a temporal probabilistic graph so that the elapsed time between observations also plays a role in defining whether a sequence of observations constitutes an activity. We first propose a data structure called temporal multiactivity graph to store multiple activities that need to be concurrently monitored. We then define an index called Temporal Multiactivity Graph Index Creation (tMAGIC) that, based on this data structure, examines and links observations as they occur. We define algorithms for insertion and bulk insertion into the tMAGIC index and show that this can be efficiently accomplished. We also define algorithms to solve two problems: the evidence problem that tries to find all occurrences of an activity (with probability over a threshold) within a given sequence of observations, and the identification problem that tries to find the activity that best matches a sequence of observations. We introduce complexity reducing restrictions and pruning strategies to make the problem-which is intrinsically exponential-linear to the number of observations. Our experiments confirm that tMAGI- has time and space complexity linear to the size of the input, and can efficiently retrieve instances of the monitored activities.",1041-4347,,,10.1109/TKDE.2011.246,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095553,Activity detection;indexing;stochastic automata;timestamped data,Automata;Context awareness;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Monitoring;Stochastic processes,computational complexity;computerised monitoring;data structures;graph theory;probabilistic automata;probability;stochastic automata,concurrent activity monitoring;data structure;evidence problem;high-level activity occurrence detection;identification problem;interleaved data streams;intrinsically exponential problem;space complexity;tMAGIC index;tMAGIC insertion algorithm;temporal multiactivity graph index creation;temporal multiactivity probabilistic graph;temporal stochastic automaton-based activity model indexing;time complexity;timestamped observation data streams,,3,,16,,12/6/2011,Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers.

Generating Compact Classifier Systems Using a Simple Artificial Immune System,"Leung, K.; Cheong, F.; Cheong, C.","RMIT Univ., Melbourne","Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on",20070924,2007,37,5,1344,1356,"Current artificial immune system (AIS) classifiers have two major problems: 1) their populations of B-cells can grow to huge proportions, and 2) optimizing one B-cell (part of the classifier) at a time does not necessarily guarantee that the B-cell pool (the whole classifier) will be optimized. In this paper, the design of a new AIS algorithm and classifier system called simple AIS is described.

Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes.

In this paper, a BN is used to build automatic intrusion detection system based on signature recognition. The goal is to recognize signatures of known attacks, match the observed behavior with those known signatures, and signal intrusion when there is a match.

With mounting global network connectivity, the issue of intrusion has achieved importance, promoting active research on efficient Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a new bio-inspired model which is applied for solving various problems in the field of information security. The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response. The fundamental design of our proposed AIS based IDS consists of 2 main components: IDS central engine and detection sensors. Each of these components is composed of some agents which correlate with each other in order to detect the anomalies and intrusions.

The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings.

Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks. The DFA based pattern matching methods are fast enough but require more memory.

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced.

Bayesian Model Averaging of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Intrusion Detection,"Liyuan Xiao; Yetian Chen; Chang, C.K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Iowa State Univ.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset.

Whenever the intrusion takes place, intrusion detection technology is used to ensure the data integrity and system availability. Normally the intrusion is considered as an abnormal activity performed by the intruder. The breaking of information system or occurrence of any abnormal activity if performed by the intruder is known as intrusion. Based on the nature of access the intruders can be broadly classified into two groups, as internal intruders and external intruders. One who is having the access permission but trying to perform unauthorized or illegal activities is known as internal intruders. On the other hand one who do not have the access permission, but attacks the system with variety of techniques is called identified as external intruders. The IDS is a security management system for the computers and networks. It helps in monitoring and detecting all the activity which takes place in the Network. On consideration, the firewall technology works on the predetermined rule set. In contrast to this, IDS is potential to be present throughout the network as dynamic defense system. Hence it helps to catch all types of attacks. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a method of search through solution space towards an optimal solution that uses the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. The main motivating factor for using GA is that it makes no use of domain knowledge; it works on probabilistic techniques making use of payoff data. Another huge advantage that GA has over other learning systems is that GA is totally unsupervised, once set in motion, it presents the user with a good solution. These coupled with the versatility and robustness of GA makes the technique of choice for this work.

It is immense challenge for researcher to protect the mobile ad hoc network from the malicious node as topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious node can easily inject false routes into the network. A traditional method to detect such malicious nodes is to establish a base profile of normal network behavior and then identify a node's behavior to be anomalous if it deviates from the established profile. As the topology of a MANET constantly changes over time, the simple use of a static base profile is not efficient. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to detect the malicious node in MANET. In proposed method k-means clustering-based anomaly detection approach is used in which the profile is dynamically updated. The approach consists of three main phases: training, testing and updating. In training phase, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in order to establish a normal profile. In testing phase, check whether the current traffic of the node is normal or anomalous. If it is normal then update the normal profile otherwise isolate the malicious node and ignore that node from the network.

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions.

Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks.

However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time.

A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home.

Conservative vs. Optimistic Parallelization of Stateful Network Intrusion Detection,"Schuff, D.L.; Yung Ryn Choe; Pai, V.S.","Purdue Univ. West Lafayette, West Lafayette, IN","Performance Analysis of Systems and software, 2008. ISPASS 2008. IEEE International Symposium on",20080507,2008,,,32,43,"This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).",,978-1-4244-2232-6,978-1-4244-2233-3,10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736,,Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn,computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols,TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion,,4,,22,,,20-22 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,1987,1995,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576,,Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers,Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols,Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression,,2,,25,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In our paper, top-ten classification algorithms namely J48, BayesNet, Logistic, SGD, IBK, JRip, PART, Random Forest, Random Tree and REPTree were selected after experimenting with more than twenty most widely used classification algorithms. The comparison of these top-ten classification algorithms is presented in this paper based upon their performance metrics to find out the best suitable algorithm available.

Towards feature subset selection in intrusion detection,"Ahmad, I.; e Amin, F.","Dept. of Software Eng., King Saud Univ., Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC), 2014 IEEE 7th Joint International",20150323,2014,,,68,73,"Intrusion is a serious issue in computer and network systems because a single intrusion can cause a heavy loss in few seconds. To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications. Therefore, the PSO based method is proposed in feature subset selection in this research work.",,978-1-4799-4420-0,,10.1109/ITAIC.2014.7065007,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065007,Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm (GA);Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);Subset,Computers;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines,eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature selection;genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data,GA;PCA;PSO;computer systems;discriminative subset;eigenspace;eigenvalues;false alarms;feature subset selection;genetic algorithm;network systems;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;principal component analysis;robust intrusion detection system,,0,,20,,,20-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The approach presented is capable of detecting both obfuscated and clear text attacks, and is suitable for implementation in the Windows environment. A prototype intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of detecting code injection attacks, both clear text attacks and obfuscated attacks, which targets Windows systems is presented",1063-9527,0-7695-2461-3,,10.1109/CSAC.2005.5,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565234,,Application software;Australia;Buffer overflow;Computer architecture;Information security;Intrusion detection;Jacobian matrices;Monitoring;Prototypes;Taxonomy,operating systems (computers);security of data,UNIX;Windows system;clear text attack;code injection vulnerability;heap buffer overflow;heterogeneous network;intrusion detection system;network code injection attack detection;obfuscated attack;software vulnerability;stack buffer overflow,,2,1,12,,,5-9 Dec. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Graphical techniques in intrusion detection systems,"Gelbord, B.",,"Information Networking, 2001. Proceedings. 15th International Conference on",20020807,2001,,,253,258,"As coordinated attacks on networks become more frequent, the study of systems that can identify unlawful attempts to penetrate a network, or so called intrusion detection systems (IDS), has become increasingly popular. IDS traditionally suffer from an inability to detect an attack that is built from a sequence of valid network activity. For this reason it is important to develop a system capable of analyzing the global nature of the network activity. One such system is GrIDS-a graph based intrusion detection system for large networks, being developed at the University of California, Davis, California. This system constructs graphs based on the network activity and then detects attacks based on an analysis of the characteristics of these graphs. One of the bottlenecks in this process is the inability to efficiently compare characteristics of very large networks. This often becomes necessary because the increasing complex nature of network traffic generates graphs with multiple nodes and edges. We propose using a new result on subgraph isomorphism due to Eppstein (see Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, vol.3, no.3, p.1-27, 1999) to maximize the efficiency of this analysis. This provides the IDS with the ability to analyze traffic on a broader level and thus increases the overall performance of the system",,0-7695-0951-7,,10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905436,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905436,,Authorization;Computer industry;Computer network reliability;Explosives;Information security;Intelligent networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;graph theory;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,GrIDS;Internet security;University of California;coordinated network attacks;graph based intrusion detection system;graphical techniques;large networks;network characteristics;network traffic analysis;subgraph isomorphism;system performance;valid network activity,,0,3,6,,,2001,31 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Thus, the adversary can reprogram the compromised sensors and deviates sensor network functionality.

Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay.

International",20080815,2008,,,606,613,"While a variety of AIDS (anomaly-based intrusion detection system) are claimed to be fully distributed, lightweight, and ready for application, their detection cost are not always neglectable, especially when considering the fact that MANET nodes have scarce resources which usually impels them to avoid any unnecessary action. It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.",,978-1-4244-2201-2,978-1-4244-2202-9,10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004,,Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security,AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy,,1,,18,,,6-8 Aug. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection.

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731,Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine,Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput,deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching,ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching,,1,,30,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine
Packet pre-filtering for network intrusion detection,"Sourdis, I.; Dimopoulos, V.; Pnevmatikatos, D.; Vassiliadis, S.","Electr. Eng. Dept, Tech. Univ.

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.",,978-1-59593-580-9,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536,intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering,Costs;Engines;Face detection;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Reconfigurable architectures;Scalability;Software performance;Throughput,computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security,DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture,,1,,17,,,3-5 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient.

Active mapping: resisting NIDS evasion without altering traffic,"Shankar, U.; Paxson, V.","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA, USA","Security and Privacy, 2003. Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on",20030521,2003,,,44,61,"A critical problem faced by a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is that of ambiguity. The NIDS cannot always determine what traffic reaches a given host nor how that host will interpret the traffic, and attackers may exploit this ambiguity to avoid detection or cause misleading alarms. We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests. We found wide variation across operating systems' TCP/IP stack policies in real-world tests (about 6700 hosts), underscoring the need for this sort of disambiguation.",1081-6011,0-7695-1940-7,,10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199327,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199327,,Costs;Databases;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Prototypes;Runtime;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing,authorisation;computer network management;network operating systems;network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,NIDS evasion;TCP/IP-based ambiguity;active mapping;disambiguation;host TCP/IP policies;host profiles;misleading alarms;network intrusion detection system;network topology profiles;operating systems;traffic,,26,28,20,,,11-14 May 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced.

However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach).

In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision.

The proposed scheme is deterministic, pair-wise keys are not pre-distributed but generated starting from partial key components, keys management exploits benefits from both symmetric and asymmetric schemes (hybrid cryptography) and each key in a pair node can be generated only if nodes have been authenticated (key authentication). Network topology authentication, and hybrid key cryptography are the building blocks for this proposal: the former means that a cryptographic key can be generated if and only if the current network topology is compliant to the ldquoplanned network topologyrdquo, which acts as the authenticated reference; the latter means that the proposed scheme is a combination of features from symmetric (for the ciphering and authentication model) and asymmetric cryptography (for the key generation model). The proposal fits the security requirement of a cryptographic scheme for WSN in a limited computing resource. A deep quantitative security analysis has been carried out.

Robust and Fast Pattern Matching for Intrusion Detection,"Namjoshi, K.; Narlikar, G.","Bell Labs., Alcatel-Lucent, Paris, France","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE",20100506,2010,,,1,9,"The rule language of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a critical role in its effectiveness. A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149,,Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness,backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data,Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language,,4,1,36,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

It builds on an existing method of application intrusion detection developed at the University of New Mexico that uses a system call sequence as a signature. Intrusions are detected by comparing the signature of the intrusion and that of the normal application. But when the system call sequences generated by the intrusion and the normal application are sufficiently similar, this method cannot work. By extending system call signature to incorporate temporal information related to the application, we form a richer signature. Analysis shows that the temporal behavior for many applications is relatively stable. We exclude high variance data when creating a normal database to characterize an application with a temporal signature. It can then be the basis for future comparisons in an intrusion detection system. This paper discusses experiments that test the effectiveness of the temporal signature on different applications, alternative intrusions, and in various environments. The results show that by choosing appropriate analysis methods and experimentally adjusting the parameters, intrusions are readily detected.

Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency.

This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar.

The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed.

Features Selection for Intrusion Detection Systems Based on Support Vector Machines,"Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON","Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2009. CCNC 2009. 6th IEEE",20090218,2009,,,1,8,"Intrusion detection systems (EDSs) deal with large amounts of data containing irrelevant and/or redundant features. These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

In this paper we investigate algorithms aiming at optimizing the deployment of DNIDS systems. We use Group Betweenness Centrality (GBC) as an approximation of the DNIDS deployment utility. In this work we use two cost models. The first cost model assumes that all network intrusion detection devices have the same cost. The second model assumes that the cost of the device is relative to the traffic load on the network node on which it is installed. We evaluate two algorithms for finding the most prominent group in these cost models. The first algorithm is based on greedy choice of vertices and the second is based on heuristic search and finds the optimal deployment locations. We investigate combinations of heuristic functions based on solution cost and on solution utility and different node ordering strategies. We show that intelligent choice of the heuristic functions and node ordering can speed up the search. Empirical evaluation shows that while in the first cost model the greedy algorithm produces results that are negligibly close to optimal in the second cost model the difference between optimal and suboptimal solutions can be significant.,1550-3607,978-1-4244-6402-9,,10.1109/ICC.2010.5502182,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502182,,Communications Society;Cost function;Greedy algorithms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic,computer network security;search problems,DNIDS deployment utility;DNIPS;cost benefit deployment;cost model;group betweenness centrality;heuristic search;high-speed network;large-scale network;network intrusion detection devices;real time distributed network intrusion detection systems,,0,,27,,,23-27 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic.

A quantitative approach towards detection of an optimal attack path in a wireless network using modified PSO technique,"Ghosh, N.; Nanda, S.; Ghosh, S.K.","Sch. of Inf. Technol., Indian Inst. of Technol., Kharagpur","Communication Systems and Networks and Workshops, 2009. COMSNETS 2009. First International",20090331,2009,,,1,10,"In recent years there has been an immense proliferation of wireless networks and they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Thus there is a serious need to secure such networks from attacks. Usually an attacker can penetrate into a network by utilizing a chain of exploits. An exploit is a small piece of code that makes use of vulnerabilities present in a service or in a system. Each exploit in the chain has a set of preconditions and effects and lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploits. Application of such a chain of exploits generates a set of attack states or network states which form a path called the attack path and combining many such attack paths produces an attack graph. A lot of research has been done on issues such as scalable and time efficient ways of generation of attack graphs in wired network in contrast to that in wireless scenario. Moreover, the need is to identify the path that may be chosen by the attacker to comprise a target system in less time and effort. The proposed methodology in this paper aims as finding out the optimal or risk-prone attack path that the attacker may choose to penetrate a wireless network. The generation of attack paths in a wireless network is itself a difficult proposition due to networks inherent dynamic nature and ever changing topology. In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been employed for finding out the optimal attack path using an attack vector metric. The effort required on the part of the attacker to compromise a target system has been termed as an attack vector. The wireless nodes have been assigned severity measures obtained from customized risk parameters which serve as an input to the modified PSO technique. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.",,978-1-4244-2912-7,978-1-4244-2913-4,10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808869,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808869,,Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;IP networks;Information technology;National security;Network topology;Particle swarm optimization;Wide area networks;Wireless networks,particle swarm optimisation;radio networks;telecommunication security,attack graph;attack vector metric;chain-of-exploits;modified PSO;network security;optimal attack path;particle swarm optimization;wireless network,,1,,35,,,5-10 Jan. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Protecting peer-to-peer network with roaming agents,"Banik, S.M.; Urey, H.","Dept. of Math. & Comput. Sci., Citadel, Charleston, SC, USA",SoutheastCon 2015,20150625,2015,,,1,6,"Peer-to-peer networks are continuously becoming more popular for sharing data and resources. However, a major drawback of this type of network is its ability to maintain security, since there is no centralized server to oversee the network. One way to remedy this problem is through the use of intelligent mobile agents. These agents will act as guards, which will essentially roam the network and periodically check on each node to ensure that it is not under attack. In our previous research, we have proposed algorithms for initial placement of agents in a given peer-to-peer network. As the agents are mobile, the next issue with agent-based security is how the agents should roam around the network to detect attacks. We want the agents to scan the entire network as quickly as possible which will minimize the detection time of attacks. If we run too many agents simultaneously to scan the network, they will consume system resources which will slow down the performance of applications running on the peer-to-peer network. In this paper we have proposed three roaming algorithms for agents. The first algorithm Heavy Scan Algorithm scans the network with minimum time by sacrificing the performance of the application. The second algorithm Light Scan Algorithm takes the maximum time to complete the scan of the entire network with less degradation of the performance of the application. The third algorithm Medium Scan Algorithm balances time to complete the scan with performance of the application. We have illustrated the proposed algorithms with an example.

Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.",,978-1-4673-6320-4,,10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581,,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training,Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection,Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction,,0,,20,,,19-21 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Network Intrusion Detection Systems in High-Speed Traffic in Computer Networks,"Bulajoul, W.; James, A.; Pannu, M.","Fac. of Eng. & Comput., Coventry Univ., Coventry, UK","e-Business Engineering (ICEBE), 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on",20131219,2013,,,168,175,"With the various and increasingly malicious attacks on networks and wireless systems, traditional security tools such as anti-virus programs and firewalls are not sufficient to provide free, integrated, reliable and secure networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most tested and reliable technologies to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks. It is critical to implement network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic and high-speed connectivity. Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped. We suggest a parallel NIDS technology to reduce dropping packets as a solution.",,,,10.1109/ICEBE.2013.26,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686259,IDS;network security;open source,Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Telecommunication traffic,computer network security;telecommunication traffic,DoS/DDoS;HTTP;ICMP;Snort NIDSs;Snort performance analysis;TCP;UDP;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;flood attacks;high-speed traffic;incoming network traffic monitoring;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection systems;outgoing network traffic monitoring;security tools;unauthorized usage identification;wireless systems,,0,,23,,,11-13 Sept. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The system works by using system calls made by privileged UNIX processes and trains the neural network on its basis. An algorithm is proposed that prioritize the speed and efficiency of the training phase and also limits the false alarm rate. In the detection phase the algorithm provides implementation of window size to detect intrusions that are temporally located. Also a threshold is implemented that is altered on basis of the process behavior. The system is tested with attacks that target different intrusion scenarios.

e-NeXSh: achieving an effectively non-executable stack and heap via system-call policing,"Kc, G.S.; Keromytis, A.D.","Google Inc., Mountain View, CA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 21st Annual",20060103,2005,,,15 pp.,302,"We present e-NeXSh, a novel security approach that utilises kernel and LIBC support for efficiently defending systems against process-subversion attacks. Such attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software to override its program control-flow and consequently invoke system calls, causing out-of-process damage. Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process. We implemented e-NeXSh as a set of modifications to the Linux-2.4.18-3 kernel and a new user-space shared library (e-NeXSh.so). The technique is transparent, requiring no modifications to existing libraries or applications. e-NeXSh was able to successfully defeat both code-injection and LIBC-based attacks in our effectiveness tests.

An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers,"Danhua Guo; Bhuyan, L.N.; Bin Liu","Microsoft Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20121011,2012,20,5,1426,1439,"L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors.

The proposed approach scales up the balance detection rates for different types of network intrusions, and keeps the false positives at acceptable level in network intrusion detection. The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.

Creating Vulnerability Signatures Using Weakest Preconditions,"Brumley, D.; Hao Wang; Jha, S.; Song, D.",,"Computer Security Foundations Symposium, 2007. CSF '07. 20th IEEE",20070716,2007,,,311,325,"Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.",1940-1434,0-7695-2819-8,,10.1109/CSF.2007.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657,,Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic,safety systems;security of data;software reliability,automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions,,9,2,50,,,6-8 July 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Detecting Malicious Javascript in PDF through Document Instrumentation,"Daiping Liu; Haining Wang; Stavrou, A.",,"Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on",20140922,2014,,,100,111,"An emerging threat vector, embedded malware inside popular document formats, has become rampant since 2008. Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries.

Consequently, they either significantly lose performance, or inevitably make invasive modifications to the processor inside. Our solution also rely on external hardware for DIFT, but unlike theirs, ours exploits the core debug interface (CDI) to tackle the communication issue. CDI is provided in most commercial processors for debugging so that we were able to build our system simply by plugging our hardware to the processor via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor itself.

While checking multiple bytes in scanning the text at a time, the BLAST algorithm overcomes the reduction of the average shift value in a typical search, which is caused by the dependency on the multi-byte search unit (MBSU) and the large frequency of the last character of the given patterns.

In this paper, we first show that memory requirements using traditional methods are prohibitively high for many patterns used in packet scanning applications. We then propose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage. Further, we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regular expressions into several engines, resulting in remarkable improvement of regular expression matching speed without much increase in memory usage.

The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes.

An effective network-based Intrusion Detection using Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm augmented with near-deterministic detector generation,"Senhua Yu; Dasgupta, D.","Dept. of Comput.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step.

As an example, the integration between telecommunication and physical processes, that happens when the power grid is managed and controlled, yields to epistemic uncertainty. Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied.

The cloud computing has lended many user friendly features in terms of various services available through internet but the harsh reality about cloud computing is that they are prone to security threat attacks. One of the major concerning security threats is called Distributed Denial of service attack (DDOS).

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks.

Third International Conference on",20141110,2013,,,200,208,"With the increasing importance of the internet in our day-to-day life, data security in web application has become very crucial. Ever increasing online and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server.

However, the extraction of flow features is difficult due to the increasing line rates, a broad range of network protocols, and a variety of complex flow features.

In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed.

First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming.

Data preprocessing for distance-based unsupervised Intrusion Detection,"Said, D.; Stirling, L.; Federolf, P.; Barker, K.","Dept. of Comput.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset.

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods.

In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling.

The novel idea pursued in this study is to exploit the real time properties of data in intrusion detection. Data objects will be tagged with time semantics that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system. The experimental results show that this technique could be a powerful discriminating measure to identify intruders with a low false alarm rate.

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade.

This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm, which continuously models a data stream. A set of features is used to represent the characteristics of an activity. For each feature, the clusters of feature values corresponding to activities observed so far in an audit data stream are identified by the proposed clustering algorithm for data streams.

DBSCAN needs less knowledge of input parameters. Major advantage of DBSCAN is to identify arbitrary shape objects and removal of noise during the clustering process. Beside its familiarity, DBSCAN has problems with handling large databases and in worst case its complexity reaches to O(n<sup>2</sup>). Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm. We also compare these variations with one another to select the efficient algorithm. In most of the variations partitioning and hybrid methodologies are originated to deal DBSCAN problems. We concluded with some variations which perform better than other variation over defined criteria (objectives).",,978-1-4244-8001-2,,10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625720,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625720,Clustering;DBSCAN;Data Mining,Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Lead;Noise;Partitioning algorithms;Prototypes;Spatial databases,computational complexity;noise;pattern clustering;visual databases,DBSCAN variation;noise removal;spatial database clustering,,2,,37,,,14-16 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
A hybrid approach for dynamic intrusion detection in ad hoc networks using genetic algorithm and artificial immune system,"Barani, F.","Higher Educ. Complex of Bam, Bam, Iran","Intelligent Systems (ICIS), 2014 Iranian Conference on",20140421,2014,,,1,6,"Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a self-created and self organized network of wireless mobile nodes. Due to special characteristics of these networks, security issue is a difficult task to achieve. Hence, applying current intrusion detection techniques developed for fixed networks is not sufficient for MANETs. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole. Experimental results show that GAAIS is more efficient in comparison with similar approaches.",,978-1-4799-3350-1,,10.1109/IranianCIS.2014.6802607,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802607,Ad hoc network;Artificial immune system;Genetic algorithm;Intrusion detection;Routing attack,Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Vectors,artificial immune systems;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,AIS;AODV-based MANET;GA;NS2 simulator;NicheMGA algorithm;artificial immune system;blackhole simulator;dynamic intrusion detection technique;flooding simulator;genetic algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor simulator;network topology;network traffic;normal feature vector extraction;routing attack simulation;rushing simulator;security;spherical detector;wireless mobile node;wormhole simulator,,0,,13,,,4-6 Feb. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In fact, using open source web applications is a double-edged sword in that it supplies both attackers and defenders more control over their security aspect. Well-known attacks are aimed access resources that are not referenced by the web application and lead to information discloser. Inspired by the idea of a sniper lurking in the shadows of civilization as a secret guard, this paper proposes a framework-named Sniper-to improve the security of open source web applications. Mimicking a real sniper who hides in the bushes to watch and eliminate dangerous enemies, the proposed Sniper framework is hidden within the web application to capture potential attackers. To illustrate further, if an attacker approaches your website seeking sensitive data, Sniper will be there watching to detect the intrusion, notify the webmaster anonymously, and block the attacker based on predefined thresholds. Therefore, Sniper identifies and mitigates attack attempts ahead of time by monitoring suspicious traffic intended to reach forbidden or sensitive areas. Sniper was implemented and tested using three different open source web applications.

Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats.

However, most existing network-based signatures are specific to exploit and can be easily evaded. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching.

Automatic flow classification using machine learning,"Anantavrasilp, I.; Scholer, T.","Tech. Univ. Dresden, Dresden","Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks, 2007. SoftCOM 2007. 15th International Conference on",20080201,2007,,,1,6,"Network standards are moving toward the quality-of-service (QoS) networking. Differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS model is adopted by many recent and upcoming networks standard. Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user. Cross-user classifications yield average correctness up to 74.15%.",,978-953-6114-93-1,978-953-6114-95-5,10.1109/SOFTCOM.2007.4446129,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446129,,Application software;Communication standards;Communications technology;Computer science;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Throughput,DiffServ networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification,automatic flow classification;differentiated services;legacy flow classification;machine learning;network standard;packet-level data,,2,,30,,,27-29 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost).

Optimization of Massive Pattern Queries by Dynamic Configuration Morphing,"Laptev, N.; Zaniolo, C.","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Data Engineering (ICDE), 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on",20120702,2012,,,917,928,"Complex pattern queries play a critical role in many applications that must efficiently search databases and data streams. Current techniques support the search for multiple patterns using deterministic or non-deterministic automata. In practice however, the static pattern representation does not fully utilize available system resources, subsequently suffering from poor performance. Therefore a low overhead auto-reconfigurable automaton is needed that optimizes pattern matching performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration.

The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces.

While such implementations, capable of handling lower protocol layers, have been extensively studied in research and industry, their extension to higher communication layers has only rarely been addressed. Such capabilities, including the application level (OSI Layer 7), are the focus of this work.

Real-Time Intrusion Detection and Tracking in Indoor Environment through Distributed RSSI Processing,"Kaltiokallio, O.; Bocca, M.","Sch. of Electr. Eng., Dept. of Autom. &amp; Syst.

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.",1533-2306,978-1-4577-1118-3,,10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830,RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks,,13,,28,,,28-31 Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel.

Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.",1060-9857,978-0-7695-3826-6,,10.1109/SRDS.2009.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421,exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware,Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server,Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security,HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit,,1,1,36,,,27-30 Sept. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

As network protocols have become increasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has become increasingly error-prone.

A Zebu specification, based on the notation used in RFCs, describes protocol message formats and related processing constraints.

Filtering sources of unwanted traffic,"Soldo, F.; El Defrawy, K.; Markopoulou, A.; Krishnamurthy, B.; Van der Merwe, J.","California Univ., Irvine, CA","Information Theory and Applications Workshop, 2008",20080815,2008,,,199,208,"There is a large and increasing amount of unwanted traffic on the Internet today, including phishing, spam, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. One way to deal with this problem is to filter unwanted traffic at the routers based on source IP addresses. Because of the limited number of available filters in the routers today, aggregation is used in practice: a single filter describes and blocks an entire range of IP addresses. This results in blocking of all (unwanted and wanted) traffic generated from hosts with IP addresses in that range. In this paper, we develop a family of algorithms that, given a blacklist containing the source IP addresses of unwanted traffic and a constraint on the number of filters, construct a set of filtering rules that optimize the tradeoff between the unwanted and legitimate traffic that is blocked. We show that our algorithms are optimal and also computationally efficient.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent.

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM.

Development of a Secure Traffic Analysis System to Trace Malicious Activities on Internal Networks,"Hirono, S.; Yamaguchi, Y.; Shimada, H.; Takakura, H.","Grad. Sch. of Inf.

By using a dedicated malware for evading detection at the initial attack, an attacker quietly succeeds in setting up a front-line base in the target organization. Communication between the attacker and the base adopts popular protocols to hide its existence. Because conventional countermeasures deployed on the boundary between the Internet and the internal network will not work adequately, monitoring on the internal network becomes indispensable. In this paper, we propose an integrated sandbox system that deploys a secure and transparent proxy to analyze internal malicious network traffic. The adoption of software defined networking technology makes it possible to redirect any internal traffic from/to a suspicious host to the system for an examination of its insidiousness. When our system finds malicious activity, the traffic is blocked. If the malicious traffic is regarded as mandatory, e.g., For controlled delivery, the system works as a transparent proxy to bypass it. For benign traffic, the system works as a transparent proxy, as well. If binary programs are found in traffic, they are automatically extracted and submitted to a malware analysis module of the sandbox.

We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier.

The major advantages of cyber maneuvers relative to other moving-target defenses are described. The use of maneuver keys in making cyber maneuvers much more feasible and affordable is explained. As specific examples, the applications of maneuver keys in encryption algorithms and as spread-spectrum keys are described.

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware.

The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32%, giving a 8% increase in sensor performance, while locality buffers improve sensor performance by about 10%.

Accordingly, we pose the evaluation and the deployment problems; the former is to evaluate the new coverage measure of a given sensor network, and the latter is to find an optimal placement of k additional sensor nodes to improve the coverage for a given positive integer k. We present several algorithms solving the problems that are either centralized or localized with theoretical proofs and simulation results, showing that our algorithms are efficient and easy to implement in practice while the quality of outputs is guaranteed by formal proofs. Our algorithms are based on an interesting relation between our new coverage measure and a certain quantity of a point set, called the bottleneck, which has been relatively well studied in other disciplines.

Our scheme allows a network gateway to encrypt summaries of network flows before submitting them to an untrusted repository. When network intrusions are suspected, an authority can release a key to an auditor, allowing the auditor to decrypt flows whose attributes (e.g., source and destination addresses, port numbers, etc.) fall within specific ranges. However, the privacy of all irrelevant flows are still preserved.

The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist. In this paper, we address the challenges of determining and detecting unauthorized access to data stored in MapReduce based cloud environments.

Malware Clearance for Secure Commitment of OS-Level Virtual Machines,Zhiyong Shan; Xin Wang; Tzi-Cker Chiueh,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Renmin Univ. of China, Beijing, China","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20130307,2013,10,2,70,83,"A virtual machine(VM) can be simply created upon use and disposed upon the completion of the tasks or the detection of error. The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2012.88,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643,Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment,Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining,invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines,OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping,,1,,39,,11/30/2012,March-April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

An Efficient Task Allocation Protocol for P2P Multi-agent Systems,Dayong Ye; Quan Bai; Minjie Zhang; Khin Than Win; Zhiqi Shen,"Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Software Eng., Univ. of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia","Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, 2009 IEEE International Symposium on",20090818,2009,,,11,18,"Recently, task allocation in multi-agent systems has been investigated by many researchers. Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.",,978-0-7695-3747-4,,10.1109/ISPA.2009.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966,,Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness,multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation,P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment,,2,,16,,,10-12 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted.

Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images,"Bazi, Y.; Melgani, F.","Dept. of Inf. & Commun. Technol., Trento Univ.","Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on",20061030,2006,44,11,3374,3385,"Recent remote sensing literature has shown that support vector machine (SVM) methods generally outperform traditional statistical and neural methods in classification problems involving hyperspectral images. However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers.

Several protocols have been proposed to make the routing protocols handle attacks in MANETs. These protocols detect the misbehaving nodes and re-route the data packets around them, mostly along the shortest such path. However, no single protocol handles all the attacks. A variant of the problem for routing around misbehaving nodes in ad hoc networks can be stated as: given a set of nodes under the danger of attack, one wishes to determine the path which is farthest from the endangered nodes. The problem does not address the problem of handling attack directly but tries to minimize the impact of attack. The problem also finds its applications in sensor networks.

For the GPU-to-GPU case, we consider several refinements to a base GPU implementation and measure the performance gain from each refinement. For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory. This analysis is done for GPUs with one I/O channel to the host as well as those with 2. Experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU that has 240 cores running off of a Xeon 2.8 GHz quad-core host CPU show that, for the GPU-to-GPU case, our Aho-Corasick GPU adaptation achieves a speedup between 8.5 and 9.5 relative to a single-thread CPU implementation and between 2.4 and 3.2 relative to the best multithreaded implementation. For the host-to-host case, the GPU AC code achieves a speedup of 3.1 relative to a single-threaded CPU implementation. However, the GPU is unable to deliver any speedup relative to the best multithreaded code running on the quad-core host. In fact, the measured speedups for the latter case ranged between 0.74 and 0.83.

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, based on frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection respectively. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to quickly find out frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences.",,978-1-4244-2113-8,978-1-4244-2114-5,10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593135,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593135,Frequency pattern (FP);Information security;Intrusion Detection;System-call sequence;Tree pattern (TP),Aquaculture;Automation;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intelligent control;Intrusion detection;Operating systems,data mining;security of data,FP;TP;computer intrusions;computer system;frequency patterns;information security;intrusion detection;operating system;sequential mining;short sequence model;system-call sequences;tree patterns,,1,,14,,,25-27 June 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

However, the routinely produced analytical data from computer networks are usually of very huge in size. This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

SAW: Java Synchronization Selection from Lock or Software Transactional Memory,"Yamada, Y.; Iwasaki, H.; Ugawa, T.","Dept. of Comput.

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.",1521-9097,978-1-4577-1875-5,,10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266,Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization,Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving,Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing,Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance,,0,,21,,,7-9 Dec. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

HVSM: An In-Out-VM security monitoring architecture in IAAS cloud,Yaqiang Mao; Xujian Chen; Yuan Luo,"Comput. Sci. & Eng.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.",,978-1-84919-909-4,,10.1049/cp.2014.1285,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816,Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen,,cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation,GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique,,0,,,,,14-16 Nov. 2014,,IET,IET Conference Publication

Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power.

Integrated security analysis framework for an enterprise network - a formal approach,"Bera, P.; Ghosh, S.K.; Dasgupta, P.","Sch. of Inf.

Usually, the network security policy is defined as the collection of service access rules between various network zones. The specification of the security policy is often incomplete since all possible service access paths may not be explicitly covered. This policy is implemented in the network interfaces in a distributed fashion through sets of access control (ACL) rules. Formally verifying whether the distributed ACL implementation conforms to the security policy is a major requirement. The complexity of the problem is compounded as some combination of network services may lead to inconsistent hidden access paths. Further, failure of network link(s) may result in the formation of alternative routing paths and thus the existing security implementation may defy the policy. In this study, an integrated formal verification and fault analysis framework has been proposed which derives a correct ACL implementation with respect to given policy specification and also ensures that the implementation is fault tolerant to certain number of link failures. The verification incorporates boolean modelling of the security policies and ACL implementations and then formulates a satisfiability checking problem.",1751-8709,,,10.1049/iet-ifs.2009.0174,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672444,,,Boolean functions;authorisation;business communication;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;formal verification;network routing;telecommunication network topology,access control rules;alternative routing paths;boolean modelling;enterprise network;fault analysis;fault tolerant;formal approach;formal verification;hidden access paths;integrated security analysis;network interfaces;network link failure;network security policy;network topology;service access rules,,3,,,,,Dec-10,,IET,IET Journals & Magazine

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480,Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation,Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers,computer network security;invasive software;risk management,botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores,,0,,21,,7/10/2015,Nov. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value.

Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs).

A large number of messages are exchanged for key establishment at startup and every time a node join or leave the group to refresh keys. These operations incur huge computation and communication cost that reduces the network life time. To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations. XKFS only requires a light weight message from a more powerful head node and thus eliminates the inter node communication cost. The performance of the XKFS is validated through simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the performance supremacy of XKFS over contemporary schemes in terms of minimizing key freshness operations and energy consumption.",,978-1-4799-8827-3,,10.1109/ITNG.2015.32,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113467,Energy efficiency;Key freshness;Key management;Secure group communication;Wireless sensor networks,Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks,computer network security;electronic messaging;private key cryptography;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks,XKFS;energy consumption minimization;huge communication cost;huge computation cost;left shift operations;lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme;magic word;message exchange;message transmission;resource constrained WSN;secret key establishment;wireless sensor network life time,,0,,17,,,13-15 April 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers.

Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think,"Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.",,"Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,185,190,"A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.",,,,10.1109/SPW.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302,,Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches,Internet;finite state machines;protocols,FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications,,0,,9,,,17-18 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Stealthy Attacks in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks: Detection and Countermeasure,"Khalil, I.; Bagchi, S.","Coll. of Inf. Technol., United Arab Emirates Univ., Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110620,2011,10,8,1096,1112,"Stealthy packet dropping is a suite of four attacks-misrouting, power control, identity delegation, and colluding collision-that can be easily launched against multihop wireless ad hoc networks. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring.

Scalable matching and ranking for network search,"Uddin, M.; Stadler, R.; Clemm, A.","ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH R.

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists.

In this paper, we investigate traffic impacts of cyber attacks considering real-world driver behavior, especially the built-in safety redundancy of the visual verification by drivers or autonomous driving system. More specifically, we study the impact of false-accident attacks on the stability of traffic flow. In the false-accident attack, a vehicle sends out a false accident alert to its surrounding vehicle through CV-enabled network and has considered an attacking scenario that has catastrophic effects. Traffic flow stability is based on widely-used numerical linear stability analysis methods, the ring road test. In such a test, vehicles are restricted within a ring road so that traffic congestion and perturbations appear in cyclic patterns indicating the stability of traffic flow. The study indicates that false-accident attacks do not necessarily yield significant impact on the stability of traffic flow.

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures.

We present the architecture of VisFlowConnect-IP, a powerful new tool to visualize IP network traffic flow dynamics for security situational awareness. VisFlowConnect-IP allows an operator to visually assess the connectivity of large and complex networks on a single screen. It provides an overall view of the entire network and filter/drill-down features that allow operators to request more detailed information. Preliminary reports from several organizations using this tool report increased responsiveness to security events as well as new insights into understanding the security dynamics of their networks.

This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer). In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori.

Particular areas of concern are the deliberate and intended actions associated with malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, or the compromise of networks, communications or other IT resources, of which the most harmful and difficult to detect threats are those propagated by an insider. However, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information, such as what is found in document control and management systems, are limited in scope and capabilities. In order to address this issue, this effort involves performing further research and development on the existing graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) system. GBAD discovers anomalous instances of structural patterns in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. Input to GBAD is a labeled graph in which entities are represented by labeled vertices and relationships or actions are represented by labeled edges between entities. Using the minimum description length (MDL) principle to identify the normative pattern that minimizes the number of bits needed to describe the input graph after being compressed by the pattern, GBAD implements algorithms for identifying the three possible changes to a graph: modifications, insertions and deletions.

Scalable multi-pipeline architecture for high performance multi-pattern string matching,"Weirong Jiang; Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources.

Application-level survivability, the ability to reconfigure an application to transparently maintain services when part of a system becomes unavailable, is the most flexible and comprehensive approach to supporting mission fulfillment since it can provide assurance over all lower layers within a networked system. We have developed resumable FTP, an application based on RFC 959, which has the ability to resume the download of a file after the download has been interrupted by users or by lower layers (loss of connection). FTP continues to be the most common method for bulk data transfer across networks and as high-performance network infrastructures have become established, default implementations of FTP have not kept pace.

A forensic hypervisor for process tracking and exploit discovery,"Kuhn, S.; Taylor, S.","Thayer Sch. of Eng., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2012 - MILCOM 2012",20130128,2012,,,1,5,"Real-time forensic reconstruction of a processes memory and interaction history is impractical in modern computing environments because the volume of data processed by a typical server is immense. Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts.

Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing.

On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM. The director on the introspection VM filters all the alerts and delegates the execution of a proper action to a notifier whenever an intrusion or an attempt to modify the IDSes is detected.

We design a novel secure routing protocol for MANETs. This protocol TAODV (Trusted AODV) extends the widely used AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) routing protocol and employs the idea of a trust model to protect routing behaviors in the network layer of MANETs. In the TAODV, trust among nodes is represented by opinion, which is an item derived from subjective logic. The opinions are dynamic and updated frequently as our protocol specification: if one node performs normal communications, its opinion from other nodes' points of view can be increased; otherwise, if one node performs some malicious behaviors, it is ultimately denied by the whole network. A trust recommendation mechanism is also designed to exchange trust information among nodes. The salient feature of TAODV is that, using trust relationships among nodes, there is no need for a node to request and verify certificates all the time. This greatly reduces the computation overheads. Meanwhile, with neighbors' trust recommendations, a node can make objective judgement about another node's trustworthiness to maintain the whole system at a certain security level.",1095-323X,0-7803-8155-6,,10.1109/AERO.2004.1367726,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1367726,,Ad hoc networks;Aerodynamics;Aerospace engineering;Computer science;Logic;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Routing protocols,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security,ad hoc on-demand distance vector;aerospace applications;certificate verification;military applications;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer protection;secure ad hoc networks;trust model based routing protocol;trust recommendation mechanism,,20,2,27,,,6-13 March 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level.

However, there are further challenges that remain to be addressed such as the availability of the required analytic software for various application domains, estimation and subscription of necessary resources for the analytic job or workflow, management of data in the cloud, and design, verification and execution of analytic workflows. We present a taxonomy for analytic workflow systems to highlight the important features in existing systems. Based on the taxonomy and a study of the existing analytic software and systems, we propose the conceptual architecture of CLoud-based Analytics-as-a-Service (CLAaaS), a big data analytics service provisioning platform, in the cloud. We outline the features that are important for CLAaaS as a service provisioning system such as user and domain specific customization and assistance, collaboration, modular architecture for scalable deployment and Service Level Agreement.",,978-0-7695-5006-0,,10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.18,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6597120,AaaS;Analytics;CLAaaS;analysis;cloud;scientific workflow management system;service;taxonomy;workflow,Collaboration;Data handling;Data storage systems;Data visualization;Information management;Software;Taxonomy,cloud computing;data analysis;workflow management software,CLAaaS;analytic software;analytic workflow systems;analytics service provisioning platform;cloud based analytics as a service;cloud technology;computing resources;data analytics;knowledge discovery;modular architecture;scalable deployment;scalable provisioning;service level agreement;service provisioning system;software resources,,4,,29,,,June 27 2013-July 2 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A Framework for Clustering Categorical Time-Evolving Data,Fuyuan Cao; Jiye Liang; Liang Bai; Xingwang Zhao; Chuangyin Dang,"Sch. of Comput. & Inf.

However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.",1063-6706,,,10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229,Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting,Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning,computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning,categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning,,5,,34,,5/20/2010,Oct. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20140227,2014,63,1,270,289,"This paper presents a new method, capable of automatically generating attacks on binary programs from software crashes. We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt.

Advanced algorithms for fast and scalable deep packet inspection,"Kumar, S.; Turner, J.; Williams, J.","Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO","Architecture for Networking and Communications systems, 2006. ANCS 2006. ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20080725,2006,,,81,92,"Modern deep packet inspection systems use regular expressions to define various patterns of interest in network data streams. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a content-less identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD<sup>2</sup>FAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.",,978-1-59593-580-9,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579526,DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions,Added delay;Automata;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Information security;Inspection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Permission;Throughput,computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;grammars;storage management,content addressed delayed input;content addressing;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;expression representation;memory access;network applications;network data streams;regular expression parsing;state traversal process;table compression,,15,2,34,,,3-5 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Traffic flow management in next generation service provider networks  Are we there yet?,"Goss, R.; Botha, R.","Inst. for ICT Advancement, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ., Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Information Security South Africa (ISSA), 2011",20110926,2011,,,1,6,"For years a number of savvy Internet users have avoided firewalls and traffic engineering measures by directing traffic through ports seemingly unrelated to the application. These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as safe or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

Bypassing Space Explosion in High-Speed Regular Expression Matching,"Patel, J.; Liu, A.X.; Torng, E.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20141218,2014,22,6,1701,1714,"Network intrusion detection and prevention systems commonly use regular expression (RE) signatures to represent individual security threats. While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a Union then Minimize framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a Minimize then Union framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms.

Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other.

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training.

Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second.

VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored. We have confirmed that the overheads of kernel monitoring and co-migration were small.",,,,10.1109/CloudCom.2013.23,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753786,IaaS clouds;intrusion detection systems;migration;virtual machines,Bridges;Linux;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Ports (Computers);Switches;Synchronization,cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines,IDS offloading;IDSes;IaaS clouds;VM introspection;VMCoupler;guard VM;infrastructure-as-a-service;intrusion detection system;kernel monitoring;synchronized comigration;virtual machine,,2,,19,,,2-5 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
