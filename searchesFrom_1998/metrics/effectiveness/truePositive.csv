In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time.

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset.

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system.

The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system.

Robust Correlation of Encrypted Attack Traffic through Stepping Stones by Flow Watermarking,"Xinyuan Wang; Reeves, D.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110314,2011,8,3,434,449,"Network-based intruders seldom attack their victims directly from their own computer. Often, they stage their attacks through intermediate stepping stones in order to conceal their identity and origin. To identify the source of the attack behind the stepping stone(s), it is necessary to correlate the incoming and outgoing flows or connections of a stepping stone. To resist attempts at correlation, the attacker may encrypt or otherwise manipulate the connection traffic. Timing-based correlation approaches have been shown to be quite effective in correlating encrypted connections. However, timing-based correlation approaches are subject to timing perturbations that may be deliberately introduced by the attacker at stepping stones. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based-correlation scheme that is designed specifically to be robust against timing perturbations. Unlike most previous timing-based correlation approaches, our watermark-based approach is active in that it embeds a unique watermark into the encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. The unique watermark that is embedded in the encrypted flow gives us a number of advantages over passive timing-based correlation in resisting timing perturbations by the attacker. In contrast to the existing passive correlation approaches, our active watermark-based correlation does not make any limiting assumptions about the distribution or random process of the original interpacket timing of the packet flow. In theory, our watermark-based correlation can achieve arbitrarily close to 100 percent correlation true positive rate (TPR), and arbitrarily close to 0 percent false positive rate (FPR) at the same time for sufficiently long flows, despite arbitrarily large (but bounded) timing perturbations of any distribution by the attacker. Our paper is the first that identifies 1) accurate quantitative tradeoffs between the achievable correlation effectiveness - nd the defining characteristics of the timing perturbation; and 2) a provable upper bound on the number of packets needed to achieve a desired correlation effectiveness, given the amount of timing perturbation. Experimental results show that our active watermark-based correlation performs better and requires fewer packets than existing, passive timing-based correlation methods in the presence of random timing perturbations.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.35,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551157,Network-level security and protection;correlation;intrusion tracing;stepping stone.,Correlation;Cryptography;Decoding;Delay;Robustness;Watermarking,cryptography;random processes;watermarking,encrypted attack traffic;false positive rate;flow watermarking;network based intruder;random timing perturbation;stepping stones;true positive rate;watermark based correlation scheme,,1,,37,,8/19/2010,May-June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load hot-spot, which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means.

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system.

There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts.

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem.

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms.

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy.

Meta-alerts may then be the basis for reporting to security experts or for communication within a distributed intrusion detection system. We propose a novel technique for online alert aggregation which is based on a dynamic, probabilistic model of the current attack situation. Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low.

None has focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset.

A network management system (NMS) is responsible for monitoring the performance of a network. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is responsible for detecting and responding to intrusions. The current practice is that NMS and IDS are independent to each other in a network. There is little integration and information sharing between the two. We outline an approach to integrate NMS and IDS so that the security capabilities of network management can be enhanced and the performance of IDS can be improved.,,0-7803-7382-0,,10.1109/NOMS.2002.1015591,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1015591,,Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer network management;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Technology management,Internet;security of data;software agents;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security,ID agents;Internet;NMS-IDS integration;distributed denial of service attacks;distributed systems;hierarchical system;intrusion detection system;knowledge base;network management system;network performance monitoring;network security;network-based services;security network management;service disruptions,,5,6,23,,,2002,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper.

Random-Forests-Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Jiong Zhang; Zulkernine, M.; Haque, A.","TELUS, Toronto, ON","Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on",20080819,2008,38,5,649,659,"Prevention of security breaches completely using the existing security technologies is unrealistic. As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.",1094-6977,,,10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103,Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests,Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data,computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data,IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches,,14,,39,,,Sept. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality.

A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel.

System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model.

Towards an Information-Theoretic Approach for Measuring Intelligent False Alarm Reduction in Intrusion Detection,Yuxin Meng; Lam-for Kwok,"Dept. of Comput.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.",,,,10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847,Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection,Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement,information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation,,1,,24,,,16-18 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Traditionally, feature-based one-class classifiers are the main components of anomaly detection systems. The performance of this anomaly detection system largely depends on the result of the feature selection. dissimilarity representations describe an object by its dissimilarities to a set of target class. The dissimilarity-based one-class classifiers (DBOCCs) are constructed on dissimilarity representations. Redundancy and relativity of the features cast little influence on the performance of DBOCCs. This paper proposes anomaly detection using DBOCCs with unsupervised learning approach. Several combinations of DBOCCs scheme have also been used.

In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster based anomaly detection scheme by assigning few randomly chosen cluster heads a critical task of estimating the reliability of the mobile beacon node. As localization of remaining nodes is cautiously performed only after verifying the authenticity of the mobile beacon node, a considerable overhead is saved in the incorrect localization of the entire network.

Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods.

In this article, a survey of the state-of-the-art in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are proposed for WSNs is presented. Firstly, detailed information about IDSs is provided. Secondly, a brief survey of IDSs proposed for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) is presented and applicability of those systems to WSNs are discussed. Thirdly, IDSs proposed for WSNs are presented. This is followed by the analysis and comparison of each scheme along with their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, guidelines on IDSs that are potentially applicable to WSNs are provided. Our survey is concluded by highlighting open research issues in the field.",1553-877X,,,10.1109/SURV.2013.050113.00191,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6517052,IDS;MANET;WSN;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;wireless sensor network,Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Unified modeling language;Wireless sensor networks,mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,IDS guidelines;MANET;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc network;research issues;wireless sensor networks,,7,,74,,5/17/2013,First Quarter 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,
On network intrusion detection for deployment in the wild,"Sun-il Kim; Nwanze, N.; Edmonds, W.; Johnson, B.; Field, P.","Electr. & Comput. Syst. Eng., Univ. of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, USA","Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), 2012 IEEE",20120607,2012,,,253,260,"As the number of network-based attacks continue to increase, network operations and management tasks become more and more complex. As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.",1542-1201,978-1-4673-0267-8,978-1-4673-0268-5,10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906,,Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning,Internet;computer network management;computer network security,Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices,,0,,19,,,16-20 April 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200,Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy,Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security,Internet;computer network security;data privacy,DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure,,0,,56,,2/10/2015,May-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

The purpose of the first stage is to systematically construct the probability distribution of relative uncertainty for normal network traffic behavior. In the second stage, we use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, a calculation that measures the level of difference of two probability distributions, to detect abnormal network activities. The probability distribution of the relative uncertainty for short-term network behavior is compared with that of the long-term profile constructed in the first stage.

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture.

We propose to represent samples of network packet header data as frames or images. With such a formulation, a series of samples can be seen as a sequence of frames or video, revealing certain kinds of attacks to the human eye. This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic. We show that scene change analysis can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies. We also show that motion prediction techniques can be employed to understand the patterns of some of the attacks.

Secondly, for the low frequency subband coefficients, we present a fusion rule based on the local entropy; while for the high frequency subband coefficients, a fusion rule based on the directional contrast combined with the local area energy is applied.

Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series. This method mines structural behavior patterns of the associated graph and detects anomaly traffic through data mining and entropy-based information theoretic techniques.

Signature Tree Generation for Polymorphic Worms,Yong Tang; Bin Xiao; Xicheng Lu,"Coll. of Comput., Nat.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined more specific relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2010.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493,Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation,,digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures,NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering,,7,,36,,6/17/2010,Apr-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,
Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection,Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou,"Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat.

The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.",,978-1-4577-1459-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432,,Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training,Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing,CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs,,1,,18,,,5-6 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.",,978-1-4673-0296-8,978-1-4673-0297-5,10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339,Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection,Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security,computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic,IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations,,0,,23,,,3-7 Jan. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

To accommodate this increase in application and data complexity, web services have moved to a multitiered design wherein the webserver runs the application front-end logic and data are outsourced to a database or file server. In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications.

MANET nodes operate in a decentralized trust no peer mode that complicates and inhibits security services, thus creating a formidable security challenge. Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a neighborhood watch concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it.

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general.

One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail.

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors.

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption.

On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques.

Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets.

Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries.

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages.

Extant solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely mainly on prior explicit knowledge of specific worm signatures. As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets. Our results indicate that using this approach resulted, in above 90% average accuracy, and for specific unknown worms accuracy reached above 99%, using just 20 features while maintaining a low level of false positive rate",,1-4244-0700-1,,10.1109/CISDA.2007.368150,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219097,,Application software;Computational intelligence;Computer worms;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;File systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Operating systems;Software packages,Internet;computer viruses;data mining;pattern classification,World Wide Web;antivirus tools;background applications activity;classification algorithms;computer behavior;computer configurations;data mining;specific worm signatures;unknown computer worms activity;unknown worms detection,,2,1,31,,,1-5 April 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,
Leveraging social networks to detect anomalous insider actions in collaborative environments,"You Chen; Nyemba, S.; Wen Zhang; Malin, B.","Dept. of Biomed.

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions).

However, the routinely produced analytical data from computer networks are usually of very huge in size. This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts.

However, constructing and maintaining a misuse intrusion detection system for a network is labor  intensive, since attack scenarios and patterns need to be analyzed and categorized. Moreover, the rules corresponding to the scenarios and patterns need to be carefully hand-coded. In such situations, data mining can be used to ease this inconvenience. This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which uses Enhanced C4.5 which rely on labeled training data and an Enhanced Fast Heuristic Clustering Algorithm for mixed data (EFHCAM). The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously unseen attacks.

This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment.

This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection.

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions.

In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort).

The scale of damage that could be done on these infrastructures by well-planned cyber-attacks is enormous. Most of the research work done for the security of these critical infrastructures focuses on conventional security measures. In this paper, we designed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is based on the novel approach of Honey Token based Encrypted Pointers to prevent critical infrastructure networks from cyber-attacks particularly from zero day cyber threats. These honey tokens inside the frame will serve as a trap for the attacker. All nodes operating within the working domain of critical infrastructure network are divided into four different pools. This division is based according to their computational power and level of vulnerability. These pools are provided with different levels of security measures within the network. IDS use different number of Honey Tokens (HT) per frame for every different pool. Moreover every pool uses different types of encryption schemes (AES-128,192,256) etc. We use critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes for our simulations. We analyzed the performance of IDS in terms of True Positive and False Negative Alarms. Finally we test this IDS through Network Penetration Testing (NPT). This NPT is accomplished by putting the critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes directly under the zero day cyber-attacks and then we analyze the behavior of the IDS under such realistic conditions.

On the three aspects, timestamp precision is the key to keep internal event sequence, time synchronization is the base of correcting event sequence among computers, and that network delay makes time-series analysis not true.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920  1080) frames per second.

But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account.

Intrusions using security breaches to achieve unauthorized access or misuse of critical information can have catastrophic consequences. To protect computer hosts from the increasing threat of intrusion, various kinds of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed. The main disadvantages of current IDSs are a high false detection rate and the lack of post-intrusion decision support capability. To minimize these drawbacks, we propose an event-driven intrusion detection architecture which integrates subject-verb-object (SVO) multi-point monitors and an impact analysis engine.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK).

Relevance feature selection with data cleaning for intrusion detection system,"Suthaharan, S.; Panchagnula, T.","Dept. of Comput.

In order to obtain good accuracy in the evaluation, very large datasets should be considered. Intrusion traffic and normal traffic are in general dependent on a large number of network characteristics called features. However not all of these features contribute to the traffic characteristics. Therefore, eliminating the non-contributing features from the datasets, to facilitate speed and accuracy to the evaluation of machine learning techniques, becomes an important requirement. In this paper we suggest an approach which analyzes the intrusion datasets, evaluates the features for its relevance to a specific attack, determines the level of contribution of feature, and eliminates it from the dataset automatically. We adopt the Rough Set Theory (RST) based approach and select relevance features using multidimensional scatter-plot automatically. A pair-wise feature selection process is adopted to simplify. In our previous research we used KDD'99 dataset and validated the RST based approach. There are lots of redundant data entries in KDD'99 and thus the machine learning techniques are biased towards most occurring events. This property leads the algorithms to ignore less frequent events which can be more harmful than most occurring events. False positives are another important drawback in KDD'99 dataset. In this paper, we adopt NSL-KDD dataset (an improved version of KDD'99 dataset) and validate the automated RST based approach. The approach presented in this paper leads to a selection of most relevance features and we expect that the intrusion detection research using KDD'99-based datasets will benefit from the good understanding of network features and their influences to attacks.",1091-0050,978-1-4673-1374-2,,10.1109/SECon.2012.6196965,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196965,NSL-KDD dataset;Rough Set Theory;intrusion detection;labeled datasets;relevance feature selection,Approximation methods;Cleaning;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning,feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;security of data,KDD'99-based datasets;NSL-KDD dataset;automated RST based approach;data cleaning;intrusion detection system;intrusion traffic;machine learning technique;multidimensional scatter-plot;network characteristics;network features;noncontributing feature;pairwise feature selection process;redundant data entries;relevance feature selection;rough set theory,,1,,17,,,15-18 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

An architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system using cooperating agents,"Sen, J.; Sengupta, I.; Chowdhury, P.R.","Dept. of Comput.

International Conference on",20091002,2006,,,1,6,"An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security mechanism that is expected to monitor and detect intrusions into the computer systems in real time. The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy.

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths.

In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes.

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods.

First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack.

Performance Evaluation of Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS for MANET,"Agrawal, A.; Patidar, M.; Sharma, M.K.","Dept. of CSE, SIMS, Indore, India","IT in Business, Industry and Government (CSIBIG), 2014 Conference on",20150312,2014,,,1,6,"MANET is an infrastructure less network and can work without any devices dependencies. These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.",,978-1-4799-3063-0,,10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980,AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network),Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing,cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation,,0,,17,,,8-9 March 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes.

It is immense challenge for researcher to protect the mobile ad hoc network from the malicious node as topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious node can easily inject false routes into the network. A traditional method to detect such malicious nodes is to establish a base profile of normal network behavior and then identify a node's behavior to be anomalous if it deviates from the established profile. As the topology of a MANET constantly changes over time, the simple use of a static base profile is not efficient. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to detect the malicious node in MANET. In proposed method k-means clustering-based anomaly detection approach is used in which the profile is dynamically updated. The approach consists of three main phases: training, testing and updating. In training phase, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in order to establish a normal profile. In testing phase, check whether the current traffic of the node is normal or anomalous. If it is normal then update the normal profile otherwise isolate the malicious node and ignore that node from the network.

This system adopts new analysis schemes to aim to reduce the relativity of each ISM component as far as possible and avoid the single point failure caused by the single central analyzer. Compared with traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs), this system is a more adaptive and efficient system. It enables member sites of ISM components in the same trust community or different ones to forewarn attacks cooperatively, and possesses higher detection rate, load balancing and better self-adaptability. By analyzing these mechanisms, it aims to guide the future research on cooperation, negotiation and coordination of multi-ISM system under open, heterogeneous and dynamic network environment.",,978-1-4244-8033-3,978-1-4244-8035-7,10.1109/ICEIT.2010.5607649,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607649,Distributed architecture;ISM;Intrusion detection system;Negotiation control form;Network security,Biology;Book reviews;Computational modeling;Lead;Organizing;SGML;XML,computer network security,ISM based architecture;Immune SoftMan;distributed architecture;intrusion detection system;load balancing;network security system,,0,,16,,,17-19 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures.

DNS-IDS: Securing DNS in the Cloud Era,"Satam, Pratik; Alipour, Hamid; Al-Nashif, Youssif; Hariri, Salim",,"Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC), 2015 International Conference on",20151029,2015,,,296,301,"Recently, there has been a rapid growth in cloud computing due to their ability to offer computing and storage on demand, its elasticity, and significant reduction in operational costs. However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.",,,,10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172,Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training,Cloud computing,,,,,,,,,21-25 Sept. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting.

SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system.

Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features.

These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set.

Rather than creating user profiles or behavioral characteristics, we trained our network using session data in the identification and tested experimentally on different attack/normal sessions. These results suggest that training the IDS on session data is not only effective in detecting intrusions, but also accurate and timely.",1098-7576,0-7803-7898-9,,10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223684,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223684,,Computational intelligence;Computer security;Detectors;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Protection;Radial basis function networks,data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;security of data,anomaly detector;host based model;identification;intrusion detection system;misuse detector;network training;radial basis function network;secure information management;session data analysis;system calls sequence,,4,,19,,,20-24 July 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

With booming number of intruders and hackers in todays vast and sophisticated computerized world, it is unceasingly challenging to identify unknown attacks in promising time with no false positive and no false negative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm.

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity.

To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS. We validate our model by means of testbed experimentation. We integrate it to our open source AP-NIDS DogoIDS and run it in an indoor wireless mesh testbed utilizing the IEEE 802.11s protocol. For the example of a selective packet dropping attack, we develop the detection states for our Bayes model, and show its feasibility. We demonstrate that our approach does not need to execute the complete set of probes, yet we obtain good detection rates.",,978-1-4799-3778-3,,10.1109/LCN.2014.6925790,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6925790,Bayes inference;Intrusion Detection;Security;Wireless Multihop Networks,Bayes methods;Equations;Intrusion detection;Probes;Spread spectrum communication;Testing;Wireless communication,Bayes methods;indoor communication;security of data;telecommunication standards;wireless mesh networks,AP-NIDS DogoIDS;Bayesian inference;Bayesian model;IEEE 802.11s;WMN;active-probing-based network intrusion detection system;indoor wireless mesh testbed;probe selection algorithm;testbed experimentation;wireless multihop networks,,0,,18,,,8-11 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Networks are complex systems, and a comprehensive intrusion detection solution has to be able to manage event streams with different content, speed, level of abstraction, and accessibility. The current network surveillance system like network intrusion detection system (NIDS) has many defects, such as low detection ability, lack of effective response mechanism, poor manageability, etc. Besides, other problems are; it only has a single function of detecting intrusion and supports and experts needed to configure different layout of NIDS makes the systems not flexible and also upgrade intolerant.

As the DOS attack evolves the cross-correlations rise thus revealing the attack. CIDS relies on changes in correlation magnitude upon shifting from normal to attack conditions, thus it is an anomaly type intrusion detection system (IDS). However it is characterized by several advantages over anomaly IDS, primarily due to the fact that it greatly reduces and/or eliminates the need to maintain normal reference profiles. Thus CIDS (1) is algorithmically simple; (2) consumes less computational and storage resources; (3) is faster in execution; (4) promises to be more robust; and, (5) is conceptually simple, thus promises to be easier to maintain. By detecting abnormal conditions, CIDS also promises to detect novel as well as known attacks, an important advantage over signature based systems. Moreover, it achieves satisfactory misclassification rates, as demonstrated by the application of the scheme to the DARPA'98 corpus of intrusion attacks, namely false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates of 0 and 0.0605, respectively, and overall missclassification rate of 0.0011.",,0-7803-8219-6,,10.1109/SARNOF.2004.1302842,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302842,,Computer crime;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Equations;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,authorisation;computer network management;correlation methods,CIDS;Correlation Intrusion Detection System;DARPA'98 corpus;DoS attacks;anomaly type IDS;computer network;denial-of-service attacks;false negative rates;false positive rates;feature cross-correlation;intrusion detection system;misclassification rates;novel attacks,,2,,3,,,26-27 Apr 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Data Intrusion Detection Processing System often contains a lot of redundancy and noise features, bringing the system a large amount of computing resources, a long training time, a poor real-time, and a bad detection rate.

Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal.

However the attacker is likely to attempt to reenter the system, and if the attacker succeeds in reentering, it might take some time for the defender's intrusion detection system (IDS) to re-detect the attacker's presence. In this interaction, both the attacker and defender are learning about each other - their vulnerabilities, intentions, and methods. Moreover, during periods when the attacker has reentered the system undetected, he is likely learning faster than the defender. The more the attacker learns, the greater the chance that he succeeds in his objective - whether it be stealing information, inserting malware, or some other objective. Conversely, the greater the defender's knowledge, the more likely that the defender can prevent the attacker from succeeding. In this setting, we study the defender's optimal strategy for expelling or not expelling an intruder. We find that the policy of always expelling the attacker can be far from optimal.

To achieve this goal, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative game between an attacker and a HIDS. The solution leads the HIDS to find the optimal number of objects that should be monitored and the corresponding monitored time. We study the case of multiple-step attack to gain more insight of the solution for this game model.

The efficiency of AIDS relies on the quality of the training data. Many prior studies encounter the problem of low hit rates and high false alarms.

Decoupling non-stationary and stationary components in long range network time series in the context of anomaly detection,"James, C.; Murthy, H.A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. &amp; Eng., Indian Inst. of Technol. Madras, Chennai, India","Local Computer Networks (LCN), 2012 IEEE 37th Conference on",20130131,2012,,,76,84,"Network traffic characterisation and modeling using time series models is an area which has been extensively studied in the past. Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.",0742-1303,978-1-4673-1565-4,,10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689,Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models,Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis,autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols,DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks,,0,,47,,,22-25 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear.

MobiQuitous 2007. Fourth Annual International Conference on",20080212,2007,,,1,8,"The exponential growth in wireless network faults, vulnerabilities, and attacks make the wireless local area network (WLAN) security management a challenging research area. Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks.

Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system.

"ARSoS: An Adaptive, Robust, and Sub-Optimal Strategy for Automated Deployment of Anomaly Detection System in MANETs","Zonghua Zhang; Nait-Abdesselam, F.; Djahel, S.","LIFL, Univ. of Sci. & Technol. of Lille, Lille","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, 2008. IWCMC '08. International",20080815,2008,,,606,613,"While a variety of AIDS (anomaly-based intrusion detection system) are claimed to be fully distributed, lightweight, and ready for application, their detection cost are not always neglectable, especially when considering the fact that MANET nodes have scarce resources which usually impels them to avoid any unnecessary action. It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem.

Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) suffer from a high rate of false alarms and missed intrusions. The detection rate has to be improved while maintaining low rate of misses. The focus of this paper is to generate the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detection dataset and detect them using the Enhanced Support Vector Machines. The DDoS dataset with various direct and derived attributes is generated in an experimental testbed which has 14 attributes and 10 types of latest DDoS attack classes. Using the generated DDoS dataset the Enhanced Multi Class Support Vector Machines (EMCSVM) is used for detection of the attacks into various classes. The performance of the EMCSVM is evaluated over SVM with various parameter values and kernel functions. It is inferred that EMCSVM produces better classification rate for the DDoS dataset with ten types of latest DDoS attacks when compared with the kddcup 99 dataset which has six types of DoS attacks.,,978-1-4673-0670-6,,10.1109/ICoAC.2011.6165212,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165212,Classification rate;DDoS dataset;Enhanced Multi Class Support Vector Machines (EMCSVM);Intrusion Detection Dataset,Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Servers;Support vector machines;Training,computer network security;data mining;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence),DDoS attack detection;data mining techniques;detection rate;distributed denial of service detection dataset;enhanced multiclass support vector machines;kddcup 99 dataset;kernel functions;machine learning;network intrusion detection system;parameter values;real time generated dataset,,1,,16,,,14-16 Dec. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.",1938-1883,978-1-4244-3435-0,978-1-4244-3435-0,10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832,,Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data,hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data,HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call,,4,,17,,,14-18 June 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats.

The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification.

Hybrid Intrusion Detection with Weighted Signature Generation over Anomalous Internet Episodes,Kai Hwang; Min Cai; Ying Chen; Min Qin,"Viterbi Sch. of Eng., Southern California Univ., Los Angeles, CA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20070212,2007,4,1,41,55,"This paper reports the design principles and evaluation results of a new experimental hybrid intrusion detection system (HIDS). This hybrid system combines the advantages of low false-positive rate of signature-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and the ability of anomaly detection system (ADS) to detect novel unknown attacks. By mining anomalous traffic episodes from Internet connections, we build an ADS that detects anomalies beyond the capabilities of signature-based SNORT or Bro systems. A weighted signature generation scheme is developed to integrate ADS with SNORT by extracting signatures from anomalies detected. HIDS extracts signatures from the output of ADS and adds them into the SNORT signature database for fast and accurate intrusion detection. By testing our HIDS scheme over real-life Internet trace data mixed with 10 days of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) attack data set, our experimental results show a 60 percent detection rate of the HIDS, compared with 30 percent and 22 percent in using the SNORT and Bro systems, respectively.

However, the goal of recent hacking attacks has changed from leaking information and destruction of services to attacking large-scale systems such as critical infrastructures and state agencies. In the other words, existing defence technologies to counter these attacks are based on pattern matching methods which are very limited. Because of this fact, in the event of new and previously unknown attacks, detection rate becomes very low and false negative increases. To defend against these unknown attacks, which cannot be detected with existing technology, we propose a new model based on big data analysis techniques that can extract information from a variety of sources to detect future attacks.

Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates.

However, suitable detection models use in honeypot system have not been fully explored. We present HonIDS, a honeypot system for detecting malicious hosts and intruders in local network. HonIDS is characterized by its layered structure and is enhanced by two detection models: TFRPP (times, frequency, range, port risk, average payload length) model and Bayes model. The basic idea of these models is that although it is hard to directly judge whether one interaction with the honeypots is an attack or malicious activity, it is possible to identify intruders by analyzing the plentiful and global events of honeypots in a given period of time. The TFRPP model gives the honeypot system the ability to assess different risks, by assigning dubiety scores to the hosts who visited honeypots. The Bayes detection model can detect some main types of attacks by classification. The results of our evaluation experiments indicate that TFRPP model and Bayes model are effective and suitable for honeypot system",,0-7695-2564-4,,10.1109/IWIA.2006.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610006,,Computer science;Event detection;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Noise generators;Payloads;Probes;Research and development;Security;Telecommunication traffic,Bayes methods;local area networks;security of data;telecommunication security,Bayes detection model;HonlDS;classification;detective function;honeypot system;intruder identification;intrusion detection system model;local network intruder detection;malicious activity;malicious host detection;risk assessment,,4,,21,,,13-14 April 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.",,978-1-4244-8335-8,978-0-7695-4214-0,10.1109/HPCC.2010.120,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281,Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy,,security of data;sensor fusion,Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system,,4,,28,,,1-3 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The ubiquity of the Internet and the easy perpetration of attacks will lead to more hostile traffic. With the advent of high-speed Internet connections, organizations today find it difficult to detect intrusions. So multi sensor intrusion detection systems are inevitable. The optimum distribution of traffic to the sensors is a challenging task. We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced. This mechanism of policy-reloading also take into account the similarity between all possible pairs of policies and tries to minimize the packet duplication rate during the operation of the system. Our mechanism is based on the observation that minimizing the percentage of traffic being duplicated can enhance system performance.

Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on",20050906,2005,2,,841,845 Vol. 2,"With the rapid development of CSCW techniques, CSCW system security has been of much attention. Its major challenge comes from malicious attacks, which cannot be handled by traditional security mechanisms, such as authorization, access control, encryption, etc. Although there existed some intrusion detection systems, current researches on intrusion detection are still insufficient in accuracy and efficiency for two reasons: firstly, most of them implement malicious transaction detection only by matching samples with predefined patterns; secondly, most current researches mainly resort to semantic analyzing or even only manual interventions to judge the malicious attacks.

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms.

In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms.

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements.

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm.

This paper studies this property by testing 356 severe attacks on the SNIDS Snort, configured with an old official rule set. Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded.

In the proposed algorithm, the mobility pattern of a specific node is characterized by a multi-leaf tree structure, second-level nodes stands for the possible starting points and leaf nodes stand for the destination node of each possible path. Since our algorithm is using statistical method, a normal profile for each node is generated through extensive experiments, where the specific tree generated may have several starting points and ending with several destination points. For each path between any two nodes (parent and children), we can get the distribution of every different mobility pattern.

Botnet detection: A cooperative game theoretical correlation-based model,"Al Ebri, N.; Otrok, H.; Mourad, A.; Al-Hammadi, Y.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Botnets are groups of compromised computers controlled by a botmaster through a command and control (C&C) channel. They are noted as one of the foremost security threat causing large scale attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Spam, mass identity theft and click fraud. Various approaches are used to detect botnets and they range from network to host level detection. To enhance the detection rate, a correlation based model was proposed that combines both host and network level information. Such a model is valid in a network made of trusted hosts. The emergence of smartphones with the capability of mobility and being hosts in different networks, open the door of having untrusted hosts that can reveal fake information. As a solution, we propose a trust-based model that uses cooperative game theory to cluster trusted hosts. The trust is built using the reputation value and it is computed using the hosts' marginal contribution which is derived from Shapley value. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection score compared to the traditional correlation model. Where in one of the simulated scenarios we are able to detect a benign cluster of hosts faster than the traditional correlation model.",,978-1-4673-5306-9,,10.1109/ICCITechnology.2013.6579517,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579517,Botnet;botnet detection system;cooperative game theory;correlation;game theory,Computational modeling;Correlation;Data models;Game theory;Games;Ports (Computers);Security,command and control systems;correlation methods;game theory;invasive software;smart phones;unsolicited e-mail,DDoS;Shapley value;botnet detection;click fraud;command and control channel;cooperative game theoretical correlation based model;distributed denial of service;host level detection;mass identity theft;smartphones;spam;trusted hosts,,0,,21,,,19-21 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.",1550-2252,978-1-4673-0989-9,978-1-4673-0988-2,10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312,,Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN,WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic,,5,,15,,,6-9 May 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative.

For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior.

A hybrid approach for database intrusion detection at transaction and inter-transaction levels,"Doroudian, M.; Shahriari, H.R.","Comput. Eng. & Inf. Technol. Dept., Amir Kabir Univ. of Technol. (Polytech.), Tehran, Iran","Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT), 2014 6th Conference on",20150205,2014,,,1,6,"Nowadays, information plays an important role in the organizations. Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels.

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it.

Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naive Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine.

Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic.

In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients.

The typical insider in a DMS already has access to documents and hence, his capabilities for information leakage are much higher. In this work, we address an important, yet unexplored problem of masquerading users in a DMS, a threat for which the DMS inherently has no protection. We approach the problem by monitoring the pattern and mannerism of user actions on documents and building a profile of each user using the resulting logs. In order to illustrate our ideas, we built user profiles of 41 users working on Microsoft Word and applied two algorithms, viz., IPAM and Nave Bayes to distinguish between them.

As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly.

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible.

One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules. We show that this automated approach is effective in reducing the number of false alarms when compared to other widely used and maintained IDSs.",1063-9527,978-0-7695-3447-3,,10.1109/ACSAC.2008.27,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721565,Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning,Application software;Computer security;Databases;Drives;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protocols;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic,data mining;digital signatures;program verification,data mining algorithm;intrusion detection verification rule;malicious behavior;network traffic monitoring;signature-based network security,,3,,22,,,8-12 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved cause and effect model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives.

In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs.

In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated.

The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models.

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS.

A Moderate to Robust Game Theoretical Model for Intrusion Detection in MANETs,"Otrok, H.; Mohammed, N.; Lingyu Wang; Debbabi, M.; Bhattacharya, P.","Concordia Inst. for Inf. Syst.

IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing,",20081021,2008,,,608,612,"One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value.

More precisely, we propose local thresholding in order to detect intra-model anomalies and use a Bayesian network in order to, on one hand, extract inter-model regularities and serve, on the other hand, as an aggregating function for computing the overall anomaly score associated with each analyzed audit event.

Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism.

In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM). Our process trace clustering approach using HMMs for system call anomaly detection provides accurate results and reduces the complexity required to detect anomalies. In this paper, we show how system call traces processed with our HMM method can provide a path forward to improved intrusion detection techniques.",,,,10.1109/SERE-C.2014.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901637,Anomaly detection;HMMs;system call traces,Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training,hidden Markov models;pattern clustering;security of data,anomalous behavior detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection;clustering approach;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection techniques;multi-HMM approach;system call anomaly detection,,0,,26,,,June 30 2014-July 2 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We show that using a Wavelet Transform (WT), the colored noise with complex Power Spectral Density (PSD) in our case can be approximately whitened. Since a larger Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate, the SNR is maximized by analyzing the signal at specific frequency ranges.

This paper presents a stat- based approach to measuring intrusion impacts on the basis of IDS reports, and analyzing costs and benefits of response polices supposed to be taken. Specifically, assuming the system evolves as a Markov process conditioned upon the current system state, imperfect observation and action, a partially observable Markov decision process to model the efficacy of IDSs (as well as alert correlation technology) as providing a probabilistic assessment of the state of system assets, and to maximize rewards (cost and benefit) by taking appropriate actions in response to the estimated states.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs.

Proceedings. 19th IEEE International",20050418,2005,,,41a,41a,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensors' locations play a critical role in many applications. Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies.

In this paper, by exploiting the location history traversed by a mobile user, two domain-independent online anomaly detection schemes are designed, namely the Lempel-Ziv (LZ)-based and Markov-based detection schemes. The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious.

When the false alarm rate or missed rate reaches the set threshold, the concept lattices should be updated to dynamically renew the rule library, and the intrusion detector should be modified to detect new intrusions, in order to detect a variety of known and unknown network attacks effectively.

An effective network-based Intrusion Detection using Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm augmented with near-deterministic detector generation,"Senhua Yu; Dasgupta, D.","Dept. of Comput.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.",,978-1-4244-9905-2,,10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393,CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic,Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing,Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines,CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation,,1,,18,,,11-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Driven by the miniaturization and integration of sensing, communication, and computation in cost-efficient devices, CPSs are bound to transform industries such as aerospace, transportation, built environments, energy, health care, and manufacturing, to name a few. This great opportunity, unfortunately, is matched by even greater challenges. Taming the complexity of design and analysis of these systems poses a fundamental problem as a new paradigm is needed to bridge various scientific domains, which, through the years, have developed significantly different formalisms and methodologies. In addition, while the use of dedicated communication networks has so far sheltered systems from the outside world, use of off-the-shelf networking and computing, combined with the unattended operation of a plethora of devices, provides several opportunities for malicious entities to inject attacks on CPSs. A wide variety of motivations exists for launching an attack on CPSs, ranging from economic reasons, such as obtaining a financial gain, all the way to terrorism, for instance, threatening an entire population by manipulating life-critical resources. Any attack on safety-critical CPSs may significantly hamper the economy and lead to the loss of human lives.

Performance enhancement of Intrusion Detection Systems using advances in sensor fusion,"Thomas, C.; Balakrishnan, N.","SERC, Indian Inst. of Sci., Bangalore","Information Fusion, 2008 11th International Conference on",20080926,2008,,,1,7,"Various intrusion detection systems reported in literature have shown distinct preferences for detecting a certain class of attacks with improved accuracy, while performing moderately on the other classes. With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture.

We measure normal behavior by system calls, resource usage and file access events and build up profiles for normal behavior with a hidden Markov model, statistical method and rule-base method, which are integrated with a rule-based approach.

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features.

Based on the investigation of correlativity changes of monitored network features during flooding attacks, this paper employs statistical covariance matrices to build a norm profile of normal activities in information systems and directly utilizes the changes of covariance matrices to detect various flooding attacks. The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack.

Modeling and Detection of Camouflaging Worm,"Wei Yu; Xun Wang; Calyam, P.; Dong Xuan; Wei Zhao","Dept. of Comput. & Inf. Sci., Towson Univ., Towson, MD, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on",20110314,2011,8,3,377,390,"Active worms pose major security threats to the Internet. This is due to the ability of active worms to propagate in an automated fashion as they continuously compromise computers on the Internet. Active worms evolve during their propagation, and thus, pose great challenges to defend against them. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, referred to as Camouflaging Worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm is different from traditional worms because of its ability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time. Thereby, the C-Worm camouflages its propagation from existing worm detection systems based on analyzing the propagation traffic generated by worms. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and nonworm traffic (background traffic). We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain. However, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the Power Spectral Density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from background traffic. Using a comprehensive set of detection metrics and real-world traces as background traffic, we conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed spectrum-based detection scheme. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation. Furthermore, we show the generality of our spectrum-based scheme in effectively detecting not only the C-Worm, but traditional worms as well.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2010.13,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444887,Worm;anomaly detection.;camouflage,Computer networks;Computer worms;Density measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Internet;Large-scale systems;Power measurement;Recruitment;Telecommunication traffic;Volume measurement,Internet;invasive software,C-Worm propagation detection;Internet;active worms;background traffic;camouflaging worm detection;camouflaging worm modeling;nonworm traffic;power spectral density distribution;propagation traffic;security threats;spectral flatness measure;spectrum-based scheme,,7,,65,,4/8/2010,May-June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist. In this paper, we address the challenges of determining and detecting unauthorized access to data stored in MapReduce based cloud environments.

Bayesian event classification for intrusion detection,"Kruegel, C.; Mutz, D.; Robertson, W.; Valeur, F.","Reliable Software Group, California Univ., Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual",20040108,2003,,,14,23,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information.

This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components.

Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped. We suggest a parallel NIDS technology to reduce dropping packets as a solution.",,,,10.1109/ICEBE.2013.26,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686259,IDS;network security;open source,Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Telecommunication traffic,computer network security;telecommunication traffic,DoS/DDoS;HTTP;ICMP;Snort NIDSs;Snort performance analysis;TCP;UDP;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;flood attacks;high-speed traffic;incoming network traffic monitoring;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection systems;outgoing network traffic monitoring;security tools;unauthorized usage identification;wireless systems,,0,,23,,,11-13 Sept. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,
An Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Lossless Compression,Nan Wang; Jizhong Han; Jinyun Fang,"Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China","Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS), 2012 IEEE 7th International Conference on",20120924,2012,,,31,38,"Anomaly detection is essential in network security. It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.",,978-1-4673-1889-1,,10.1109/NAS.2012.8,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310873,anomaly detection;data mining;grammar-based compression,Compression algorithms;Entropy;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Statistical analysis;Training,Markov processes;information theory;security of data;telecommunication security,Markovian method;Markovian model;anomaly detection algorithm;anomaly detection method;bug detection;compression algorithm;data structure;grammar compression;information quantity;information theoretic anomaly detection framework;information theoretic measures;information theory;intrusion detection;lossless compression;network security,,0,,26,,,28-30 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The novel idea pursued in this study is to exploit the real time properties of data in intrusion detection. Data objects will be tagged with time semantics that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system. The experimental results show that this technique could be a powerful discriminating measure to identify intruders with a low false alarm rate.

Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated.

Even though the correlation process is often presented as a single step, the analysis is actually carried out by a number of components, each of which has a specific goal. Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model.

The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive.

First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client.

Labeling Network Event Records for Intrusion Detection in aWireless LAN,"Khoshgoftaar, T.M.; Seiffert, C.; Seliya, N.","Comput. Sci. & Eng., Florida Atlantic Univ., Boca Raton, FL","Information Reuse and Integration, 2006 IEEE International Conference on",20061204,2006,,,200,206,"A data mining approach to network intrusion detection requires a training dataset of network event records labeled as either normal or an attack type. Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy",,0-7803-9788-6,,10.1109/IRI.2006.252413,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490,,Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks,data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN,clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN,,1,,15,,,16-18 Sept. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value.

The traditional intrusion detection systems look for unusual or suspicious activity, such as patterns of network traffic that are likely indicators of unauthorized activity. However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely attack signature, resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature.

Masquerade attacks are serious in nature due to the fact that they are mostly carried by insiders and thus are extremely difficult to detect. Detection of these attacks is done by monitoring significant changes in user's behavior based on his/her profile. Currently, such profiles are based mostly on the user command line data and do not represent his/her complete behavior in a graphical user interface (GUI) based system and hence are not sufficient to quickly detect such masquerade attacks. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating a unique feature set for user behavior on GUI based systems. We have collected real user behavior data from live systems and extracted parameters to construct these feature vectors. These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a user session. We model our technique of user identification and masquerade detection as a binary classification problem and use support vector machine (SVM) to learn and classify these feature vectors. We show that our technique can provide detection rates of up to 96% with few false positives based on these feature vectors.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources.

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it.

Gathering command data is a slow process often spanning months or years. In this paper, we propose an approach for data generation based on customizable templates, where each template represents a particular user profile. These templates can either be user-defined or created from known data sets. We have developed an automated tool called RACOON, which rapidly generates large amounts of user command data from a given template.

Fuzzy logic with better generalization capability and rapport with reality is being used in classification problems immensely. In this paper a fuzzy rule based classification system is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. Thus the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm has been applied to select a small number of significant fuzzy rules for a compact classification system applied to multivariate dataset classification. The hybrid algorithm is used here to predict cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast. Two different fitness measures were taken to evaluate the rules generated by the algorithm during evolution process. Than the performance of Fuzzy Genetic algorithm with better fitness measure is compared to the performance of Naive Bayesian approach to accurately detect and classify patterns. The performance analysis includes testing on train as well as test dataset, created from original dataset.

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this techniques by generating feature sets from a collection of network traffic and applying them to the training and detection phases of a payload-based IDS.

Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples.

This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism.

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks.

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.",,978-1-4673-6320-4,,10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581,,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training,Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection,Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction,,0,,20,,,19-21 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection.

Behavior-Profile Clustering for False Alert Reduction in Anomaly Detection Sensors,"Frias-Martinez, V.; Stolfo, S.J.; Keromytis, A.D.","Comput. Sci.

Annual",20081222,2008,,,367,376,"Anomaly detection (AD) sensors compute behavior profiles to recognize malicious or anomalous activities. The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480,Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation,Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers,computer network security;invasive software;risk management,botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores,,0,,21,,7/10/2015,Nov. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

The incremental mining approach makes the system suitable for detecting, and thus, responding to an attack in real-time. This system is evaluated by 47 flooding attacks, only one of which is missed, with no false positives occurring. The proposed online system belongs to anomaly detection, not misuse detection. Moreover, a mechanism for dynamic firewall updating is embedded in the proposed system for the function of eliminating suspicious connections when necessary.",1229-2370,,,10.1109/JCN.2010.6388474,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388474,Anomaly detection;firewall;flooding attack;fuzzy association rules;genetic algorithm;membership functions;online incremental mining,Association rules;Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetics;IP networks;Itemsets,,,,0,,28,,,Aug. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.",1930-529X,1-4244-0356-1,1-4244-0357-X,10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932,,Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;invasive software,Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system,,0,,11,,,Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost.

PCA is then employed to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and thus, detection is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. Our experiments with the KDD Cup 99 dataset, although not yet completed, have shown that this approach is promising in terms of detection accuracy.

This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

Proceedings. 2002 IEEE Symposium on",20040830,2002,,,177,187,"This paper presents an intrusion detection methodology based on the concept of noninterference for detecting race-condition attacks. In general, this type of attack occurs when an unprivileged process causes a privileged process to perform illegal operations by executing strategic operations in the appropriate timing window. We apply the noninterference model in a novel way that allows us to formally represent valid interleaving between privileged and unprivileged processes. Instead of proving a system satisfies noninterference assertions, we derive an algorithm for checking the assertions at run-time based on the developed theory and a formal model of Unix system calls. Our methodology can detect unknown race-condition attacks.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient.

Data Fusion and Cost Minimization for Intrusion Detection,"Parikh, D.; Tsuhan Chen","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829,Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection,Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition,cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion,anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms,,8,,39,,,Sept. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time.

Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for an auto-mated network management such as configuration, performance and anomaly detection.

Seventh Annual",20090519,2009,,,286,291,This paper describes a hybrid design for intrusion detection that combines anomaly detection with misuse detection. The proposed method includes an ensemble feature selecting classifier and a data mining classifier. The former consists of four classifiers using different sets of features and each of them employs a machine learning algorithm named fuzzy belief k-NN classification algorithm. The latter applies data mining technique to automatically extract computer users' normal behavior from training network traffic data. The outputs of ensemble feature selecting classifier and data mining classifier are then fused together to get the final decision.

Classification of SIP messages by a syntax filter and SVMs,"Ferdous, R.; Lo Cigno, R.; Zorat, A.","Univ. of Trento, Trento, Italy","Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2012 IEEE",20130422,2012,,,2714,2719,"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is at the root of many sessions-based applications such as VoIP and media streaming that are used by a growing number of users and organizations. The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as good or bad depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM learns the structure of the good and bad SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also real SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution.

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner.

With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets.

However, widespread IDS usage has been hindered by several challenges, including: 1) time-consuming configuration and analysis; 2) integration difficulties with existing network management infrastructure; and 3) the inability to add new attack signatures in a well-understood, yet expressive high-level notation. This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks. It provides mechanisms allowing a management station to delegate security-related tasks to mid-level managers (MLMs) that, in turn, interact with monitoring and action agents to execute these tasks. Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks).

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier.

Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic.

As rule-base IDS can gain good detecting performance, we build a genetic immune model, which is adaptive to rule-based IDS, to improve the IDS's detecting performance of new attacks. As one successful method, state transition (ST) analysis models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from initial state to a target compromised state. Using this model of recomposing the ST method to solve the low recognizing ratio problem is presented in this paper. In this model, ST method can be expressed in a double DNA chains pattern. One chain is the system state chain; the other is an action chain. The double twisting chains form a state-action sequence to represent the system state transitions. In order to still gain the recognizing performance of the regular ID systems, we use STAT rules to create the initial non-self (or expert) DNA library, and newly found attacking-rules can still be added to the library. A simple host-based test is also performed to prove the effectiveness of this model.",,0-7803-8131-9,,10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259927,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259927,,DNA;Flowcharts;Genetic algorithms;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Performance gain;Postal services;Testing,genetic algorithms;knowledge based systems;security of data,double DNA chains pattern;immune genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;rule-based IDS;state transition analysis tool;system state chain,,0,1,8,,,2-5 Nov. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

In this paper we address this issue by investigating effective solutions to automatically identify compromised machines in a network. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised.

But network intrusions are now becoming more and more sophisticated to detect, thus, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been proposed which enables an IDS to collect information and learn experience from other IDS nodes. By maintaining interactions among a set of IDS nodes, a CIDN is expected to be more powerful in detecting some complicated attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) than a single IDS. In real deployment, we identify that each IDS may have different levels of sensitivity in detecting different types of intrusions (i.e., based on their own signatures and settings). In this paper, we therefore define a notion of intrusion sensitivity and investigate the feasibility of using it to evaluate the trustworthiness of an IDS node.

ARES 08. Third International Conference on",20080523,2008,,,520,525,"A great variety of well-known attacks exist for the IEEE 802.11 protocol. The lack of mechanisms for management frame authentication and the complexity of the protocol itself have derived into a considerable number of denial of service and identity spoofing attacks. As most denial of service attacks are based on spoofing of MAC addresses, spoofed frame detection schemes have gained attentions. Currently the most efficient techniques to detect this kind of attacks are based on the creation of profiles for the wireless nodes and behavior based protocol anomaly detection. However, these techniques tend to generate too many of false positives.

To address the above issue, a two-step feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. Depending on the definition of relevant feature and redundant feature and using mutual information as criterion, it firstly eliminates the irrelevant features and then eliminates the redundant features. With low time complexity, the feature selection algorithm independent of detection algorithm could easily balance the detection accuracy and the number of features through threshold. Experiments over networks connection records from authoritative data set KDD CUP 1999 were implemented for several detection algorithms to evaluate the proposed method.

However, WSNs have limited energy resources that hinder the dissemination of the raw data over the network to a central location. This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system.

This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests.

In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.",1531-2216,1-4244-0000-7,,10.1109/ICON.2005.1635545,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635545,Alert Correlation;Data Quality;Intrusion Detection;Security,Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;Organizing;Telecommunication traffic,security of data;telecommunication security,DARPA 2000 network traffic;false positives reduction;filtering routers;firewalls;intrusion alert quality framework;security monitoring sensors,,2,,22,,,16-18 Nov. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on",20090825,2009,,,285,289,"Over the past few years, anomaly detection has been an increasing concern with the rapid growth of the network security. Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency. Further-more, it is suitable for anomaly detection with high detect rate and low false alarm rate.",,978-0-7695-3641-5,,10.1109/ICIS.2009.140,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222872,Hidden Markov model;anomaly detection;decision condition;rough set reduction;system call,Computer networks;Computer security;Costs;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Information science;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Set theory;Software,hidden Markov models;rough set theory;security of data,anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;network security;rough set reduction,,0,,11,,,1-3 June 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Unveiling flat traffic on the Internet: An SSH attack case study,"Jonker, M.; Hofstede, R.; Sperotto, A.; Pras, A.","Centre for Telematics & Inf. Technol. (CTIT), Univ. of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Integrated Network Management (IM), 2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on",20150702,2015,,,270,278,"Many types of brute-force attacks are known to exhibit a characteristic `flat' behavior at the network-level, meaning that connections belonging to an attack feature a similar number of packets and bytes, and duration. Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.",,,,10.1109/INM.2015.7140301,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301,,Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes,Internet;computer network security;security of data,IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks,,0,,14,,,11-15 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

On the Effectiveness of Monitoring for Intrusion Detection in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Boppana, R.V.; Xu Su","Dept. of Comput.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.",1536-1233,,,10.1109/TMC.2010.210,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919,Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.,Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement,Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration,,3,,32,,11/9/2010,Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

Increases in electricity demand with inadequate delivery infrastructure and cyber-physical attack threats due to technological interdependencies introduce more complex events. Accurate and timely power system event identification and detection have great significance in system operation, monitoring, and control processes. Insufficient and slow event information may lead to catastrophes. Significant research effort is being made toward developing robust monitoring systems using advanced state of the art technologies such as synchrophasor technologies. This paper extends our previous work [1] and proposes a model that leverages the causal relationship between devices in cyber physical systems.

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack.

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes.

Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks.

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, and lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. A distributed intrusion detection approach based on timed automata is given. A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then the timed automata is constructed by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of dynamic source routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify the behaviour of every nodes by timed automata, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, the approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness.

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN). In CMN we first cluster the benign training data and then from each cluster we build a separate markov network to model the benign behavior. During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data.

These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point.

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we propose a distributed intrusion detection approach based on finish state machine (FSM).A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then we construct the finite state machine (FSM) by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify every nodes behaviour by the FSM, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data.

Most of the modern intrusion detection systems lack the ability to process massive data streams to achieve anomaly detection. Instead of Intrusion detection, Intrusion prevention system can be used for both servers and end-hosts to handle the dual challenges of accuracy and performance which the former lacks. Intrusion prevention can be done by processing the data stream on fly. It is a difficult issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events.

In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically. In addition, violations of security requirements at runtime are monitored.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

Since it seems impossible to guarantee complete protection to a system by means of the classical prevention mechanisms, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem considering some techniques for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them.

At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities.

Anomaly Detection via Online Oversampling Principal Component Analysis,"Lee, Yuh-Jye; Yeh, Yi-Ren; Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank","National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei","Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20130521,2013,25,7,1460,1470,"Anomaly detection has been an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",1041-4347,,,10.1109/TKDE.2012.99,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273,Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis,Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis,,,,4,,26,,5/15/2012,Jul-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes.

IEEE 6th International Conference on",20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",,978-1-4244-5113-5,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the power spectral density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding spectral flatness measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from non-worm traffic.

A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.",,978-1-4673-4865-2,,10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224,Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network,Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks,DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network,,0,,13,,,3-5 April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports.

Security of these assets is a day-to-day job placing a tremendous cognitive load on information-technology (IT) professionals, which can make it almost impossible to manage the security aspects of KMS. Autonomic-computing systems are well suited to manage KMS, as they use high-level system objectives provided by administrators as the basis for managing the security of KMS. The authors model the self-protection and self-healing configuration attributes in autonomic systems through game-theoretic models. The proposed modeling approach progressively moves from a manual intervention-oriented security setup to an autonomic security setup. This allows the authors to compare and contrast the different approaches and provide insights on their applicability to different security environments. The authors find that moving to a partial autonomic system with self-healing mechanisms can provide a stable environment for securing enterprise knowledge assets and can reduce hacking. It is beneficial to implement an autonomic system when manual investigation costs are higher and/or when the volume of malicious traffic is very low. An autonomic approach is especially attractive when it is difficult to impose penalties on malicious users.

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic.

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in Snorts ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets.

The file server's end-users create honeyfiles, and the end-users receive the honeyfile's alarms. Honeyfiles can increase a network's internal security without adversely affecting normal operations.

iF2: An Interpretable Fuzzy Rule Filter for Web Log Post-Compromised Malicious Activity Monitoring,Chih-Hung Hsieh; Yu-Siang Shen; Chao-Wen Li; Jain-Shing Wu,"Inst. of Informaiton Ind., Taipei, Taiwan","Information Security (AsiaJCIS), 2015 10th Asia Joint Conference on",20150713,2015,,,130,137,"To alleviate the loads of tracking web log file by human effort, machine learning methods are now commonly used to analyze log data and to identify the pattern of malicious activities. Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.",,,,10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947,Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis,Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines,Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines,Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine,,0,,21,,,24-26 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.",,,,10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798,False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust,Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training,IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing,Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value,,1,,21,,,22-26 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We first identify worm characteristics through their behavior, and then classify worm detection algorithms based on the parameters used in the algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze and compare different detection algorithms with reference to the worm characteristics by identifying the type of worms that can and cannot be detected by these schemes. After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms. The locations to implement detection and containment, as well as the scope of each of these systems/methods, are also explored in depth.

With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns.

This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers.

In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach via simulation of a resource starvation attack on an Internet Service Provider infrastructure.

Dempster-Shafer evidence theory based trust management strategy against cooperative black hole attacks and gray hole attacks in MANETs,"Bo Yang; Yamamoto, R.; Tanaka, Y.","Global Inf. & Telecommun.

However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.",,978-89-968650-2-5,,10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177,Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management,Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security,cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security,Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism,,0,,11,,,16-19 Feb. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

To deal with this issue, we propose CREPUSCOLO, a collusion resistant and privacy preserving location verification system. In CREPUSCOLO, we use location-proofs collected from co-located mobile devices, which can be endorsed by a token acquired from a trusted Token Provider. In fact, location-proofs endorsed by tokens provide the resiliency against collusion attacks, because this combination can prove that a certain mobile device was at a certain location at a specific time. CREPUSCOLO also protects the source location privacy by enforcing the usage of periodically changing pseudonyms. Extensive simulations show that CREPUSCOLO is effective in detecting collusion attacks even under very conservative hypothesis.

VMI provides a novel means to detect potential malicious insiders because the introspection tools remain transparent and inaccessible to the guest and are extremely difficult to subvert.

This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets.

However, it is time and memory consuming for large datasets. This study proposed a parameter-free method to accelerate NNR. This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets.

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them.

The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions.

Efficient Network Monitoring in Enterprise Data Networks Using Node Capabilities,"Sasidharan, S.","Product Eng., Infosys Technol.

International Symposium on",20100108,2009,,,1,4,"In modern day data networks, with the increased focus on aspects like network security, band-width optimization and intrusion detection, network monitoring has become an integral part of network design. This paper discusses a method for accelerating the network policing using node capabilities. Presently network monitoring requires the hardware component regeneration tap for packet duplication and this component needs to be present in several network points. The above tap will do un-conditional packet duplication which is in-efficient. This also makes the analyzing devices do overwork in inspecting the packets. This paper thus brings out some of the in-efficiencies in the existing network monitoring systems and justifies an alternate method for doing the same. It presents a suggestive fresh view on the factors that could prove instrumental in improving monitoring of enterprise data networks by re-using some of the forwarding capabilities in the network nodes.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, most deployments over UDP, limited use of message encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level. To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages. We subject our dataset - consisting of malicious and normal SIP messages - to Euclidean distance-based classifiers as well as four standard classifiers. Our results show vast differences for Euclidean distance-based classifiers on our dataset than reported in current literature.

Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide new insights for effective defense.

In this study, we present an in-depth analysis based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed in a seven-month period.

Our analysis reveals several interesting findings about today's Internet DDoS attacks. Some highlights include: (1) geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families, (2) from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families, (3) there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn.

However, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks launch large volumes of traffic and consume network bandwidth, thus degrading the quality of the delivered multimedia service. In this paper, we present a differentiated service protection framework consisting of anomaly traffic detection and resource management. Data mining based anomaly traffic detection is implemented at the host; whereas resource management is responsible for the allocation of network resources to the applications. Based on the deviation of the monitored traffic to the normal traffic, differentiated resources are allocated to the traffic. When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS. The impact of the traffic anomalies on the legitimate services can be mitigated, and the legitimate services can be protected.

Rough set theory is used for feature reduction and Naive Bayes theorem is used for classification of documents into the predefined categories by means of the probabilistic values. The deployment of the proposed model is planned through an enhanced method of the utilization of the Naive Bayes approach and rough set theory to overcome the imprecision and vagueness in data set thus improving the classification accuracy. In Naive Bayes model, the word probabilities for a class are estimated by calculating the likelihood in the entire training documents where the training and test data are split randomly into k-subsets like 2/3 for training and 1/3 for test data. In addition, it also utilizes two level hierarchy structures for training documents like features from title, keywords and content with the predefined knowledge available. The rough set model includes the feature reduction technique through which the number of features for classification is reduced aiming at an optimal classification of text document.",,978-1-4244-5585-0,978-1-4244-5586-7,10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5451965,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451965,Feature Reduction;Feature Selection;Nave Bayes;Rough sets;Text Mining,Computer science;Data mining;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Probability;Rough sets;Set theory;Testing;Text mining,Bayes methods;classification;data mining;information retrieval;probability;rough set theory;text analysis,feature reduction;hybrid text mining model;information retrieval;naive Bayes;probabilistic value;rough set theory;text document classification;training document;word probability,,1,,22,,,26-28 Feb. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability.

The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability.

Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection,"Ye, N.; Yebin Zhang; Borror, C.M.","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on",20040405,2004,53,1,116,123,"Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.",0018-9529,,,10.1109/TR.2004.823851,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169,,Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing,Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security,Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size,,38,1,56,,,Mar-04,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances.

This study presents a comparative analysis of four different attack datasets offering three different levels of granularity: 1) two high interaction honeynets deployed at two different locations (i.e., a corporate and an academic environment); 2) ATLAS which is a distributed network telescope from Arbor; and 3) Internet Protecttrade which is a global alerting service from AT&T.",1530-2059,978-0-7695-3482-4,,10.1109/HASE.2008.50,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4708862,corporate and academic network;empirical study;global alerts;honeypots;malicious activity,Data analysis;Data security;IP networks;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Storage area networks;Telescopes;Web and internet services,Internet;security of data,ATLAS;distributed network telescope;intrusion detection systems;network attack datasets;network malicious activity;network security operators,,1,,26,,,3-5 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,
Immune Systems Inspired Approach to Anomaly Detection and Fault Diagnosis for Engines,"Djurdjanovic, D.; Jianbo Liu; Marko, K.A.; Jun Ni","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor","Neural Networks, 2007.

International Joint Conference on",20071029,2007,,,1375,1382,"As more electronic devices are integrated into automobiles to improve the reliability, drivability and maintainability, automotive diagnosis becomes increasingly difficult to deal with. Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper. The feasibility of the newly proposed paradigm is also partially demonstrated through application examples.",1098-7576,978-1-4244-1379-9,978-1-4244-1380-5,10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371159,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4371159,,Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Engines;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Immune system;Maintenance;Production;System testing;Vehicles,automotive components;automotive electronics;fault diagnosis;internal combustion engines,anomaly detection;automobiles;automotive diagnosis;diagnostic strategy;engines;fault diagnosis;immune systems inspired approach,,0,,38,,,12-17 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.).

In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature.

Reduction of False Alarm Rate in Detecting Network Anomaly using Mahalanobis Distance and Similarity Measure,"Srinivasan, N.; Vaidehi, V.","Dept. of Inf.

International Conference on",20071105,2007,,,366,371,This paper discusses about a network anomaly detection system which is aimed at reduction of the number of false positives and negatives generated by conventional IDSs. A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack.

Ever increasing online and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server.

Detecting coordinated attacks in tactical wireless networks using cooperative signature-based detectors,"Little, M.; Ko, C.","Telcordia Technol., Inc, Morristown, NJ","Military Communications Conference, 2005. MILCOM 2005. IEEE",20060320,2005,,,176,182 Vol. 1,"We describe an approach to detecting coordinated attacks in tactical wireless networks in which distributed detectors cooperate to match signatures from audit events generated at different locations. Traditionally, the signature matching engine compares the signature with a single audit data stream to identify occurrences of the action sequence described in the signature. Such approach introduces a single point of failure and uses huge bandwidth for transferring audit data from the data sources to the matching engine. Our approach decomposes an extended infinite state machine, an operational representation of an attack signature, into multiple cooperative finite state machines that enable distributed signature engines to match the signature. We describe the decomposition methodology and the distributed matching algorithm and illustrate them using several example multi-stage attacks in tactical networks. In addition, we implemented an example distributed signature matching engine for detecting the example attacks in a simulation framework based on MASON. Our approach avoids a single point of failure and reduces the bandwidth usage by communicating internal state information rather than audit events",,0-7803-9393-7,,10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605682,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605682,,Bandwidth;Collaboration;Detectors;Engines;Event detection;Government;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Wireless networks,finite state machines;military communication;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,MASON;attack signature;cooperative signature-based detectors;coordinated attacks detection;extended infinite state machine;internal state information;multistage attacks;signature matching engine;single audit data stream;tactical wireless networks,,2,,8,,,17-20 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Unfortunately, this protocol is still vulnerable to the presence of malicious nodes. To detect malicious activities, taking into consideration network lifetime, we randomly select a set of nodes that will play the role of intrusion detection monitors. The selected nodes will monitor the behavior of regular nodes, MPRs, and CHs looking for abnormal activities such as the disruption of cluster head election. Our simulation results show that with 50% of monitors we can detect malicious activities with probability more than 70%.

Background Modeling Through Statistical Edge-Segment Distributions,"Ramirez Rivera, A.; Murshed, M.; Jaemyun Kim; Oksam Chae","Dept. of Comput. Eng., Kyung Hee Univ., Yongin, South Korea","Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on",20130731,2013,23,8,1375,1387,"Background modeling is challenging due to background dynamism. Most background modeling methods fail in the presence of intensity changes, because the model cannot handle sudden changes. A solution to this problem is to use intensity-robust features. Despite the changes of an edge's shape and position among frames, edges are less sensitive than a pixel's intensity to illumination changes. Furthermore, background models in the presence of moving objects produce ghosts in the detected output, because high quality models require ideal backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a robust statistical edge-segment-based method for background modeling of non-ideal sequences. The proposed method learns the structure of the scene using the edges' behaviors through the use of kernel-density distributions. Moreover, it uses segment features to overcome the shape and position variations of the edges. Hence, the use of segments gives us local information of the scene, and that helps us to predict the objects and background precisely. Furthermore, we accumulate segments to build edge distributions, which allow us to perform unconstrained training and to overcome the ghost effect. In addition, the proposed method uses adaptive thresholding (in the segments) to detect the moving objects. Therefore, this approach increases the accuracy over previous methods, which use fixed thresholds.",1051-8215,,,10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2242551,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423877,Background modeling;edge-segments;motion detection;object detection,Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Integrated circuit modeling;Kernel;Lighting;Robustness;Shape,edge detection;image segmentation;image sequences,background dynamism;background modeling;intensity changes;kernel-density distributions;nonideal sequences;statistical edge-segment distributions,,4,,33,,1/30/2013,Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

The attacks themselves are long-lasting, difficult to expose and often use very advanced hacking techniques. Since they are advanced in nature, prolonged and persistent, the organizations behind them have to possess a high level of knowledge, advanced tools and competent personnel to execute them. The attacks are usually preformed in several phases - reconnaissance, preparation, execution, gaining access, information gathering and connection maintenance. In each of the phases attacks can be detected with different probabilities. There are several ways to increase the level of security of an organization in order to counter these incidents. First and foremost, it is necessary to educate users and system administrators on different attack vectors and provide them with knowledge and protection so that the attacks are unsuccessful. Second, implement strict security policies. That includes access control and restrictions (to information or network), protecting information by encrypting it and installing latest security upgrades.

EAACKA Secure Intrusion-Detection System for MANETs,"Shakshuki, E.M.; Nan Kang; Sheltami, T.R.","Jodrey Sch. of Comput. Sci., Acadia Univ., Wolfville, NS, Canada","Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on",20121016,2013,60,3,1089,1098,"The migration to wireless network from wired network has been a global trend in the past few decades. The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications.

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated.

In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate.

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks.

In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples.

However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection.

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training.

However, most existing collaborative intrusion detection networks rely on the exchange of intrusion data which raises privacy concerns. To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community. An automatic rule propagation mechanism is proposed based on a decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation. We evaluate our rule sharing system through simulations and compare our results to existing knowledge sharing methods such as random gossiping and fixed neighbors sharing schemes.",,978-1-4577-1588-4,978-3-901882-44-9,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104003,,Collaboration;Computers;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Receivers;Software,Internet;computer network security;groupware;telecommunication traffic,IDS community;SMURFEN;automatic rule propagation mechanism;computer activities;decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation;knowledge sharing methods;neighbors sharing schemes;network traffic monitoring;random gossiping;rule sharing collaborative intrusion detection system;system framework,,1,,21,,,24-28 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,
A Multimedia Traffic Classification Scheme for Intrusion Detection Systems,"Marques, O.; Baillargeon, P.","Dept. of Comput.

Third International Conference on",20050801,2005,2,,496,501,"Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have become widely used tools for ensuring system and network security. Among many other challenges, contemporary IDS have to cope with increasingly higher bandwidths, which sometimes force them to let some data go by without being checked for possible malicious activity. This paper presents a novel method to improve the performance of IDS based on multimedia traffic classification. In the proposed method, the IDS has additional knowledge about common multimedia file formats and uses this knowledge to perform a more detailed analysis of packets carrying that type of data. If the structure and selected contents of the data are compliant, the corresponding stream is tagged accordingly, and the IDS is spared from further work on that stream. Otherwise, an anomaly is detected and reported. Our experiments using Snort confirm that this additional specialized knowledge results in substantial computational savings, without significant overhead for processing non-multimedia data",,0-7695-2316-1,,10.1109/ICITA.2005.28,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1489011,,Computational efficiency;Computer security;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Multimedia systems;Open source software;Performance analysis;Streaming media;Telecommunication traffic,frame relay;multimedia communication;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,IDS;anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;multimedia file format;multimedia traffic classification scheme;network security,,0,,10,,,4-7 July 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The aim of this article is to introduce an efficient system for anti-evasion that can be implemented in real devices.

Rule Mode Selection in Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems,"Alsubhi, K.; Alhazmi, Y.; Bouabdallah, N.; Boutaba, R.","David R. Cheriton Sch. of Comput.

Existing IDPSs do not seem to provide a satisfactory method of achieving these two conflicting goals. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

In order to measure the effectiveness of these breach detection systems, we propose a new type of test methodology. Our approach is based on that advanced attackers who can bypass the existing layers of security have the time, skill and resources to create unknown malware, with advanced bypass capabilities.

Such an intermediate host is called a stepping-stone. The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets. A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology. The algorithm is based on finding as many matched pairs of incoming and outgoing packets on the same host as possible and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the mismatched rate. We examine a number of tradeoffs in choosing the threshold values by simulating network traffic.

We present an architecture that incorporates intrusion detection systems as sensors, and provides improved alarm data to the human operator or to automated actuators.
