Decision making is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the whole dataset is divided into some predetermined arbitrary subgroups. The proposed algorithm selects representative samples from these subgroups such that the samples reflect the entire dataset. An optimum allocation scheme is developed based on the variability of the observations within the subgroups. In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted samples to detect intrusions. We call the proposed algorithm as optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine (OA-LS-SVM) for IDS. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are carried out on KDD 99 database which is considered a de facto benchmark for evaluating the performance of intrusions detection algorithm.

A framework for security quantification of networked machines,"Hui Wang; Roy, S.; Das, A.; Paul, S.","Ind. Oper.

In addition to cryptography based protective techniques such as authentication and authorization, several defense measures, like Intrusion Detection and Tolerance, and tools are employed to protect networks thereby, making security a critical issue. Therefore, the need for defining, structuring, and quantifying security arises as a necessary first step towards measuring the effectiveness of security related deployments. This work proposes a structured approach to define and analyze security related metrics for intrusion tolerant systems for each individual host in the network and compose them in a meaningful way to provide an overall security quantification for a network. The dynamics of each machine against a particular vulnerability is modeled as a (hidden) Markov process to capture uncertainties in attacker's action and system response. Based on these stochastic analysis, security metrics of each machine are calculated which are subsequently used in the final computation of the security metrics of the network.",,978-1-4244-5487-7,,10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5431978,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431978,Markov process;Network security;hidded Markov model;intrusion detection system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probabilities;vulnerabilities,Application software;Authentication;Authorization;Computer networks;Cryptography;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Protection;Uncertainty,authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;hidden Markov models;message authentication;probability;stochastic processes,computer network;cryptography based protective technique;hidden Markov process;intrusion detection;intrusion tolerant system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probability;stochastic analysis,,1,,15,,,5-9 Jan. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Recent malware are not only becoming more sophisticated, but have also demonstrated a trend to make use of components, which can easily be distributed through the Internet to develop newer and better malware. As a result, the key problem facing Cloud security is to cope with identifying diverse sets of malware. This paper presents a method of detecting malware by identifying the symptoms of malicious behaviour as opposed to looking for the malware itself. This can be compared to the use of symptoms in human pathology, in which study of symptoms direct physicians to diagnosis of a disease or possible causes of illnesses. The main advantage of shifting the attention to the symptoms is that a wide range of malicious behaviour can result in the same set of symptoms. We propose the creation of Forensic Virtual Machines (FVM), which are mini Virtual Machines (VM) that can monitor other VMs to discover the symptoms. In this paper, we shall present a framework to support the FVMs so that they collaborate with each other in identifying symptoms by exchanging messages via secure channels. The FVMs report to a Command & Control module that collects and correlates the information so that suitable remedial actions can take place in real-time. The Command & Control can be compared to the physician who infers possibility of an illness from the occurring symptoms.

Moreover, analyzing the determinant and major attributes are highly recommended. In this research is implemented the combined Classification methods between Regression Tree method (CART) and Random Forest (RF) to build the classification model that is used in the early detection of diabetes mellitus type II disease. Those methods are selected based on the characteristics of the dataset used in medical records that consist of complex attributes consisting of several categorical attributes and continuous attributes, besides the advantages of the CART models are easy to implement, and it can explore the structure of complex medical records, while the RF method can handle the problem in accuracy. This research has tested a different number of trees and numbers of candidate attributes splitter. Based on the test results, it shows that the addition of trees and attributes splitter can improve the accuracy and reduce the error rate, with the optimal inputs are 50 numbers of trees and 3 number of attributes splitter with 83,8% average accuracy. The important attribute of early detection of diabetes mellitus type II is heredity, age, and body mass index.",,978-1-4799-6984-5,,10.1109/ICAICTA.2014.7005947,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005947,CART;Diabetes Mellitus type II;Random Forest;classification;the early detection of disease;the important attribute,Accuracy;Data models;Diabetes;Diseases;Regression tree analysis;Testing;Vegetation,diseases;electronic health records;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;regression analysis;trees (mathematics),CART models;RF method;candidate attributes splitter;categorical attributes;classification and regression tree method;complex medical record structure;continuous attributes;disease early detection;random forest;type II diabetes Mellitus early detection,,0,,12,,,20-21 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Kernel-level intrusion detection method using simplification and grouping,Bo-heung Chung; Seung-Ho Ryu; Jeong-Nyeo Kim; Jong-Soo Jang,Electron. & Telecommun. Res. Inst.,"Advanced Communication Technology, 2005, ICACT 2005. The 7th International Conference on",20050711,2005,1,,251,254,"This paper proposes the kernel-level intrusion detection method (KIDM) using simplification and grouping of intrusion detection rules. These rules group into group-rule and common-rule generated by simplification. The intrusion detection is separated into common detection and extended detection step. The packet is checked by common detection using the common-rule. If this step detects nothing, the packet is forwarded to its destination. If not, it is passed into the extended detection using the group-rule. Through grouping of similar detection rules, the search space and searching time can be greatly minimized. Using the simplified rule in intrusion detection, the packet inspection time can be largely reduced. With the help of these two steps, fast and effective intrusion detection is possible in network nodes such as router and switch",,,,10.1109/ICACT.2005.245838,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461781,,Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Switches,telecommunication networks;telecommunication security,common detection;common-rule;extended detection;group-rule;intrusion detection rule grouping;intrusion detection rule simplification;kernel-level intrusion detection method,,0,,9,,,0-0 0,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

FSKD '08. Fifth International Conference on",20081105,2008,4,,317,321,"This paper presents a new approach to detect attacks from network activities. Network connections were transformed into data points in the predefined feature space. The influence function was designed to quantify the influence of an object and, further, the data field was divided into positive field and negative field according to the source point's category. To perform classification, all the labeled training samples were regarded as source points and build a data field in the feature space. When detecting, the influence felt by given testing point in this field was calculated and behaviors class was judged according to the sign and magnitude of the influence. Experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of our approach is satisfying.",,978-0-7695-3305-6,,10.1109/FSKD.2008.15,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4666405,anomaly attack;classification;data field;network intrusion detection,Computer science;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Fuzzy systems;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Testing,pattern classification;security of data,classification;negative field;network anomaly attack detection;positive field,,1,,9,,,18-20 Oct. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
