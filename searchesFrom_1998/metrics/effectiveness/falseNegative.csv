A network traffic sample is considered an anomaly if its abstract feature falls on the outside of the fitting envelope.

Specifically, this paper considers a scenario in which an analyst has to accept or reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> characterized by a probability mass function (pmf) P<sub>X</sub> based on the evidence provided by a test sequence. In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences.

This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible.

This paper presents NetViewer, a network measurement approach that can simultaneously detect, identify, and visualize attacks and anomalous traffic in real-time by passively monitoring packet headers. We propose to represent samples of network packet header data as frames or images. With such a formulation, a series of samples can be seen as a sequence of frames or video, revealing certain kinds of attacks to the human eye. This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic. We show that ""scene change analysis"" can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies. We also show that ""motion prediction"" techniques can be employed to understand the patterns of some of the attacks.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed.

MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model",1083-4419,,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299,Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM),Computer security;Costs;Data security;Feedback;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Predictive models;Protection,data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,automatically tuning intrusion detection system;computer system;data-mining;dynamically changing environment;information systems;machine learning techniques;security experts knowledge;security layer;system operators,"Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",14,2,28,,,Apr-07,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

The scale of damage that could be done on these infrastructures by well-planned cyber-attacks is enormous. Most of the research work done for the security of these critical infrastructures focuses on conventional security measures. In this paper, we designed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is based on the novel approach of Honey Token based Encrypted Pointers to prevent critical infrastructure networks from cyber-attacks particularly from zero day cyber threats. These honey tokens inside the frame will serve as a trap for the attacker. All nodes operating within the working domain of critical infrastructure network are divided into four different pools. This division is based according to their computational power and level of vulnerability. These pools are provided with different levels of security measures within the network. IDS use different number of Honey Tokens (HT) per frame for every different pool. Moreover every pool uses different types of encryption schemes (AES-128,192,256) etc. We use critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes for our simulations. We analyzed the performance of IDS in terms of True Positive and False Negative Alarms. Finally we test this IDS through Network Penetration Testing (NPT). This NPT is accomplished by putting the critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes directly under the zero day cyber-attacks and then we analyze the behavior of the IDS under such realistic conditions.

Port scanning is one of the dangerous attacks that intrusion detection tries to detect. Snort, a famous network intrusion detection system (NIDS), detects a port scanning attack by combining and analyzing various traffic parameters. Because these parameters cannot be easily combined using a mathematical formula, fuzzy logic can be used to combine them; fuzzy logic can also reduce the number of false alarms. This paper presents a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, to detect port scanning attacks. A fuzzy logic controller is designed and integrated with Snort in order to enhance the functionality of port scanning detection. Experiments are carried out in both wired and wireless networks. The results show that applying fuzzy logic adds to the accuracy of determining bad traffic.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure.

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system.

It is proposed to give a general framework for IDS based on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics and agent technology. Our approach is focused on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. To achieve low false positive rate in this framework the intrusion can be detected by means of comparing the signature of the current user's session with already existing signatures of the potential intruder. The algorithms of computational biology such as approximation algorithm and Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm and sum-of-pairs scoring function are used to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder, the user signature and past intruder's signatures.

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data.

Proceedings. 19th Annual",20040108,2003,,,234,244,"We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.",,0-7695-2041-3,,10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328,,Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel,Internet;belief networks;security of data,Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors,,12,,19,,,8-12 Dec. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Efficient fingerprint extraction for high performance Intrusion Detection System,"Haiyang Jiang; Gaogang Xie; Salamatian, K.","Inst. of Comput.

Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction.

On the other hand, most of the current researches are using only one engine for detection of various attacks; the proposed system is constructed by a number of agents, which are totally different in both training and detecting processes. Each of the agents has its own strength on capturing a kind of network behavior and hence the system has strength on detecting different types of attack.

But this accuracy is achieved at a cost of intensive computational power and inability to detect exploits whose signatures do not exist in the database. Statistical based IDS present a way to overcome these drawbacks with a compromise over accuracy.

A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second.

High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling,"Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad. Sch. of Inf., Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan","Applications and the Internet (SAINT), 2011 IEEE/IPSJ 11th International Symposium on",20110825,2011,,,11,19,"This research aims to construct a high-performance anomaly based intrusion detection system. Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.",,978-1-4577-0531-1,978-0-7695-4423-6,10.1109/SAINT.2011.12,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129,OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system,Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data,feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data,,3,,16,,,18-21 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

An automatic portscan detection system with adaptive threshold setting,"Kim, Sang Kon; Lee, Seung Ho; Seo, Seung Woo","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science &#x0026; Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Korea","Communications and Networks, Journal of",20121220,2010,12,1,74,85,"For the purpose of compromising hosts, attackers including infected hosts initially perform a portscan using IP addresses in order to find vulnerable hosts. Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners.

In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol.

Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem.

In this paper, we propose a clustering-based detection technique using a genetic algorithm named Genetic Clustering for Anomaly-based Detection (GC-AD). GC-AD uses a dissimilarity measure to form k clusters. It, then, applies a genetic process where each chromosome represents the centroids of the k clusters. A two-stage fitness function is proposed. i) We introduce a confidence interval to refine the clusters in order to obtain partitions that are more homogeneous. ii) We compute and maximize the inter-cluster variance over the generations.

All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages.

Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination.

We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN.

In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless.

For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems.

It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes.

These alerts cause problems to human analysts to repeatedly and intensively analyze the false alerts to initiate appropriate actions. We demonstrate the advantages of using a hybrid neuro-fuzzy approach to reduce the number of false alarms. The neuro-fuzzy approach was experimented with different background knowledge sets in DARPA 1999 network traffic dataset. The approach was evaluated and compared with RIPPER algorithm.

The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-2324-8,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181,,Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server,SRAM chips;security of data,SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint,,0,,12,,,Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

We have proposed an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) base on ontology that specifying the different categories of attacks, different encoding schemes used by the hacker, location of attack, system component affected by attack, specification of protocols used and policies/rules for mitigating these attacks. The proposed ontology base system can be refined and expanded over time. The system semantically analyzes the specific field of payload and headers where attack is possible. Inference ability of the system provide the capability for detecting the zero day and complex web application attacks that easily eludes packet level inspection. Proposed system is time efficient by analyzing the specified field of protocol, would be able to provide significant search space reduction as well as low false positive rate. For describing the semantic concepts, Prottege tool is used. OWL-DL used for describing logical class with restrictions.

Unlike the common belief that IDS should be executed as often as possible to cope with insider attacks to prolong the system lifetime, we discover that IDS should be executed at an optimal rate in order to maximize the system lifetime. Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used.

As the DOS attack evolves the cross-correlations rise thus revealing the attack. CIDS relies on changes in correlation magnitude upon shifting from normal to attack conditions, thus it is an anomaly type intrusion detection system (IDS). However it is characterized by several advantages over anomaly IDS, primarily due to the fact that it greatly reduces and/or eliminates the need to maintain normal reference profiles. Thus CIDS (1) is algorithmically simple; (2) consumes less computational and storage resources; (3) is faster in execution; (4) promises to be more robust; and, (5) is conceptually simple, thus promises to be easier to maintain. By detecting abnormal conditions, CIDS also promises to detect novel as well as known attacks, an important advantage over signature based systems. Moreover, it achieves satisfactory misclassification rates, as demonstrated by the application of the scheme to the DARPA'98 corpus of intrusion attacks, namely false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates of 0 and 0.0605, respectively, and overall missclassification rate of 0.0011.",,0-7803-8219-6,,10.1109/SARNOF.2004.1302842,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302842,,Computer crime;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Equations;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,authorisation;computer network management;correlation methods,CIDS;Correlation Intrusion Detection System;DARPA'98 corpus;DoS attacks;anomaly type IDS;computer network;denial-of-service attacks;false negative rates;false positive rates;feature cross-correlation;intrusion detection system;misclassification rates;novel attacks,,2,,3,,,26-27 Apr 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts.

We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners.

As attacks on computer systems are becoming increasingly numerous and sophisticated, there is a growing need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System (AHA! IDS) provides detection adaptation by adjusting the amount of system resources devoted to the task of detecting intrusive activities. This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents. The Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System (AAIRS) provides response adaptation by weighting those responses that have been successful in the past over those techniques that have not been as successful. As a result, the more successful responses are used more often than the less successful techniques. It also adapts responses based on the system's belief that intrusion detection reports are valid.

Analyzing Log Files for Postmortem Intrusion Detection,"Garcia, K.A.; Monroy, R.; Trejo, L.A.; Mex-Perera, C.; Aguirre, E.","Scotiabank, Mexico City, Mexico","Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on",20121221,2012,42,6,1690,1704,"Upon an intrusion, security staff must analyze the IT system that has been compromised, in order to determine how the attacker gained access to it, and what he did afterward. Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any.

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.",1930-529X,1-4244-0356-1,1-4244-0357-X,10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932,,Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;invasive software,Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system,,0,,11,,,Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction.

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine.

In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems.

To detect this kind of behavior, this paper focuses on deploying high interaction honeypot system coupled with intrusion detection system on different operating system flavors which work as clients. Clients collect URLs by specifically crafted web links crawler. These URLs are then visited by application needed to visit these URLs. Finally, if these URLs are malicious and exploit the application software, an alert is triggered by signature based intrusion detection system deployed on the machine. Based on these alerts, URLs are stored in a black list of malicious URLs. We introduce design and implementation of this system in this paper.",,978-1-4799-6895-4,,10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014753,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014753,,Browsers;Crawlers;Internet;Operating systems;Security;Servers;Uniform resource locators,Internet;computer network security;digital signatures;operating systems (computers),PythonHoneyMonkey;Web links crawler;client side honeypot systems;high interaction honeypot system;malicious Web URL detection;operating system;signature based intrusion detection system,,0,,9,,,8-10 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

However, suitable detection models use in honeypot system have not been fully explored. We present HonIDS, a honeypot system for detecting malicious hosts and intruders in local network. HonIDS is characterized by its layered structure and is enhanced by two detection models: TFRPP (times, frequency, range, port risk, average payload length) model and Bayes model. The basic idea of these models is that although it is hard to directly judge whether one interaction with the honeypots is an attack or malicious activity, it is possible to identify intruders by analyzing the plentiful and global events of honeypots in a given period of time. The TFRPP model gives the honeypot system the ability to assess different risks, by assigning dubiety scores to the hosts who visited honeypots. The Bayes detection model can detect some main types of attacks by classification.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic.

To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules.

A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder","Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2007. SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on",20070820,2007,,,678,684,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, (1) impacts system performance, (2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, (3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and (4) resists collusion.",,1-4244-1268-4,1-4244-1268-4,10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292881,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292881,,Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Resists;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML,XML;telecommunication security;wireless LAN,802.11 network;XML based policy engine;bad mouthing;centralized trust authority;misbehaving nodes;physical layer information;reputation vector;reputation-enabled intrusion detection system;software programmable devices;wireless networks,,3,,22,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on",20030206,2003,,,10 pp.,,"This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.",,0-7695-1874-5,,10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909,,Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance,Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models,Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets,,15,,30,,,6-9 Jan. 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs.

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load ""hot-spot"", which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS.

Obtaining an optimal IDS configuration for effective detection of attacks is far from trivial. There exists a tradeoff between security enforcement levels and the performance of information systems. It is critical to configure an IDS in a dynamic and iterative fashion to balance the security overhead and system performance. In this paper, we use noncooperative game approaches to address this problem. We first build a fundamental game framework to model the zero-sum interactions between the detector and the attacker. Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players. An optimal policy-based configuration can be found by minimizing a discounted cost criterion, using an iterative method. In addition, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal game values when the transitions between system states are unknown.

The application of a low pass filter in anomaly network intrusion detection,"Jun Li; Manikopoulos, C.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC",20050606,2004,,,265,271,"A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.",,0-7803-8572-1,,10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826,,Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement,computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering,,0,,8,,,10-11 June 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

As with any computer application, installation of a Trojan leaves a ldquofootprintrdquo on the systems resources. However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems.

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance.

A Web service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network based on a set of XML standards. This new architecture and set of protocols brings new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services.

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks.

DoS attacks to Web services are called HTTP-GET flood attack and threats of them increase day by day. In this type of attacks, malicious clients send a large number of HTTP-GET requests to the target Web server automatically. Since these HTTP-GET requests have legitimate formats and are sent via normal TCP connections, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can not detect them. In this paper, we propose HTTP-GET flood detection techniques based on analysis of page access behavior.

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine.

The Power of Temporal Pattern Processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection,"Al-Subaie, M.; Zulkernine, M.","Queen's Univ., Kingston","Communications, 2007. ICC '07. IEEE International Conference on",20070813,2007,,,1391,1398,"A clear deficiency in most of todays anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDS) is their inability to distinguish between a new form of legitimate normal behavior and a malicious attack based on known previous normal behaviors. This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.",,1-4244-0353-7,,10.1109/ICC.2007.234,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905,,Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives,learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data,anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing,,0,,26,,,24-28 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree.

For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels.

Early statistical anomaly intrusion detection of DOS attacks using MIB traffic parameters,"Jun Li; Manikopoulos, C.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society",20030923,2003,,,53,59,"We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a χ<sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %.

One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier,"Al Naqshbandi, S.M.; Samawi, V.W.","Tilburg centre for Cognition & Commun., Tilburg Univ., Tilburg, Netherlands","Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE), 2012 IEEE International Conference on",20120820,2012,2,,204,208,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the widely used tools for defending computer networks. Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible.

Database Isolation and Filtering against Data Corruption Attacks,Meng Yu; Peng Liu,"Western Illinois Univ., Macomb","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2007. ACSAC 2007. Twenty-Third Annual",20080102,2007,,,97,106,"Various attacks (e.g., SQL injections) may corrupt data items in the database systems, which decreases the integrity level of the database. Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a ""unsafe zone"" to isolate user's SQL queries from a ""safe zone"" of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs.

In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates.

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection.

Each day the news media report yet another security breach-sometimes a localized single crime or prank at others, a denial-of-service attack affecting millions of people. As electronic commerce becomes increasingly pervasive, the subject can only become more critical. One of the more interesting techniques for enhancing information system security is detecting that an intrusion has taken place. Although intrusion-detection systems have been a part of the information security landscape for over 25 years, their proper role in the overall security picture is often misunderstood. They are not preventative security measures. Most often, they are used as active security mechanisms in conjunction with other (passive) information assurance processes like firewalls, smart cards, and virtual private networks. In practice, an intrusion-detection system (IDS) attempts to detect attacks or attack preparations by monitoring either the traffic on a computer network or the application or operating system activities within a computer. Once such behavior is detected, the IDS may alert a security administrator or it may invoke an automated response (such as closing down external communication paths or initiating a mechanism to trace the source of an attack).

Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism.

Past cyber-attacks had simple purposes of leaking personal information by attacking the PC or destroying the system. However, the goal of recent hacking attacks has changed from leaking information and destruction of services to attacking large-scale systems such as critical infrastructures and state agencies. In the other words, existing defence technologies to counter these attacks are based on pattern matching methods which are very limited. Because of this fact, in the event of new and previously unknown attacks, detection rate becomes very low and false negative increases. To defend against these unknown attacks, which cannot be detected with existing technology, we propose a new model based on big data analysis techniques that can extract information from a variety of sources to detect future attacks.

A Mechanism for Detecting and Responding to Misbehaving Nodes in Wireless Networks,"McCoy, D.; Sicker, Doug; Grunwald, D.","Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0430, Email: damon.mccoy@cs.colorado.edu","Networking Technologies for Software Define Radio Networks, 2007 2nd IEEE Workshop on",20071015,2007,,,48,54,"While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance, 2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and 4) resists collusion.",,1-4244-1315-X,1-4244-1316-8,10.1109/SDRN.2007.4348973,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4348973,,Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Standards development;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML,,,,0,,22,,,18-21 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Correlation component is a procedure which aggregates alerts according to certain criteria. The aggregated alerts could have common features or represent steps of pre-defined scenario attacks. Correlation approaches composed of a single component or a comprehensive set of components. The effectiveness of a component depends heavily on the nature of the dataset analyzed. The order of correlation component will affect the correlation process performance. Moreover not all components should be used for different dataset.

Learning agent learns the nature of dataset within a network then guides the whole correlation process and components in such a suitable way of which components could be used and in which order.

These packet inspections typically require considerable delay often consuming more than 70% of the IDS processing time. Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.",,978-1-4244-1513-7,978-1-4244-1513-7,10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922,Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber,Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design,,,,2,,14,,,29-31 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Towards dynamic self-tuning for intrusion detection systems,"Sun-il Kim; Nwanze, N.; Kintner, J.","Electr. & Comput. Syst.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs.

Towards an Information-Theoretic Approach for Measuring Intelligent False Alarm Reduction in Intrusion Detection,Yuxin Meng; Lam-for Kwok,"Dept. of Comput.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.",,,,10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847,Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection,Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement,information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation,,1,,24,,,16-18 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead.

However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system.

The key concept of our redundancy management is to exploit the tradeoff between energy consumption vs. the gain in reliability, timeliness, and security to maximize the system useful lifetime. We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.",1932-4537,,,10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999,Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security,Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management,energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm,,4,,40,,5/13/2013,Jun-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

The novelty of our approach results from the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. Our algorithm uses a semiglobal alignment and a unique scoring system to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder and the user signature, which is a sequence of commands collected from a legitimate user.

The approach is suitable for small and fast hardware implementation and was designed to be embedded in network appliances. Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components. Results using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with extremely low false positive rate.

One of the possible reasons of spoofing in wireless network is that per-frame source authentication is not provided. Full scale authentication can be provided, but it is not always desirable as it requires reliable key management. The attacker can further launch Denial of Service attacks by spoofing deauthentication/disassociation or power saving frames, can bypass the access control list or can falsely advertise services to wireless clients.

Data Fusion and Cost Minimization for Intrusion Detection,"Parikh, D.; Tsuhan Chen","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself.

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns.

Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as “normal” transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system.

Besides, historical data are not generally used, neither for analysis nor for sequential adaptation of the knowledge representation models used for detection; hence this wealthy information about the essence and the potential trends of the target system is not commonly considered. Thus, by the generalized use of Bayesian belief networks, ESIDE-Depian achieves the main goal of detecting and preventing both well-known and also zero-day attacks with excellent results, by means of unified real-time analysis of network traffic.",1529-4188,978-0-7695-2932-5,,10.1109/DEXA.2007.38,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4312918,,Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Expert systems;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Knowledge representation;Power system modeling,belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Bayesian belief networks;ESIDE-Depian intrusion detection;anomaly detection;evidence propagation;knowledge representation models;misuse detection;network traffic;parametric learning;prevention system,,3,,15,,,3-7 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction.

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service.

In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true).

In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.",,1-4244-1304-4,1-4244-1304-4,10.1109/IAW.2007.381943,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571,GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling,Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium,graphical user interfaces;security of data,GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection,,2,,11,,,20-22 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.",,978-1-4799-3078-4,,10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318,Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security,Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security,computer network security,OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks,,0,,17,,,24-27 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates.

IEEE 6th International Conference on",20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",,978-1-4244-5113-5,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates.

This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets.

The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host.

BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site.

Monitoring tools based on pattern recognition or behavioral analysis is typically used to ensure network security. SNORT is one such tool which is based on pattern recognition. SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators.

We first explain why decision trees fail in detecting most of novel attacks. In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.",,978-0-7695-3495-4,,10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046,,Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server,decision trees;security of data,behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length,,3,,21,,,11-13 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

These systems detect intrusions and prevent attackers from succeeding in their intrusion attempts. They usually rely on pattern matching and therefore, work efficiently on known-attacks. However, they do not work efficiently on unknown-attacks such as zero-day attacks and targeted attacks. This means, we should assume that our machines can be corrupted anytime. Therefore, we should consider what we can do under this assumption for a next generation security framework. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection methodology using the support of other machines. In our proposal, when an attacker tries to attack other machines from a corrupted machine that the attacker has already intruded, other machines notify it to the administrator of the corrupted machine. Then, the attacker may lose the corrupted machine. Therefore, the attacker restrains itself from imprudently attacking other machines.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE).

Signature Tree Generation for Polymorphic Worms,Yong Tang; Bin Xiao; Xicheng Lu,"Coll. of Comput., Nat.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2010.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493,Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation,,digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures,NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering,,7,,36,,6/17/2010,Apr-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general.

Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection,Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou,"Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat. Central Univ., Jungli, Taiwan","World Telecommunications Congress (WTC), 2012",20120315,2012,,,1,6,"Accompanied by the invention of information and communication of technologies, e-government has become a prominent feature of modern governance in every country. The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.",,978-1-4577-1459-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432,,Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training,Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing,CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs,,1,,18,,,5-6 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Currently the most efficient techniques to detect this kind of attacks are based on the creation of profiles for the wireless nodes and behavior based protocol anomaly detection.

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision.

In many applications, it is important to take into account some extra knowledge in addition to the one encoded by the classifier. For example, in spam filtering which can be seen as a classification problem, it can make sense for a user to require that the spam filter predicts less than a given rate or number of spams. In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as ""it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal"" can be integrated in classification tasks.

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign.

However, the security mechanism for WSNs has to be considered differently from traditional network. Firstly, there are severe constraints on WSNs devices such as minimal energy, computational and communicational capabilities. Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack.

The purpose of modeling is to construct the formal model of network security situation measurement based upon the D-S evidence theory, and support the general process of fusing and analyzing security alert events collected from security situation sensors. The generation of network security situation is to extract the frequent patterns and sequential patterns from the dataset of network security situation based upon knowledge discovery method and transform these patterns to the correlation rules of network security situation, and finally to automatically generate the network security situation graph.

QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. We proposed a novel method for detection of QRS complexes in ECG signals using Network Intrusion Detection technique used for detection of worm in networking applications for finding the frequently repeated strings in a packet stream. A novel real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing is proposed in this paper. Our technique relies more on the data stream corresponding to ECG beats than any particular feature.

This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a “uncompromised” router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment.

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets.

Classification of SIP messages by a syntax filter and SVMs,"Ferdous, R.; Lo Cigno, R.; Zorat, A.","Univ. of Trento, Trento, Italy","Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2012 IEEE",20130422,2012,,,2714,2719,"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is at the root of many sessions-based applications such as VoIP and media streaming that are used by a growing number of users and organizations. The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution.

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers.

In this paper, we study Bloom-1, a data structure that performs membership check in one memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a standard Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g and Bloom-Q, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller or comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series. This method mines structural behavior patterns of the associated graph and detects anomaly traffic through data mining and entropy-based information theoretic techniques.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic.

In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based.

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high. The analysis in the paper also brings out as to which particular method could be more suitable in a particular scenario and how one can easily get the reduced false positives, which has been a bane of current detection methods.

However, the security of IMS networks has not been fully examined. This paper presents a novel DoS attack against IMS. By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test.

Proceedings. 19th IEEE International",20050418,2005,,,41a,41a,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensors' locations play a critical role in many applications. Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes.

Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats.

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naïve Bayes classification scheme.

Towards Database Firewall: Mining the Damage Spreading Patterns,"Bai, K.; Peng Liu","The Pennsylvania State University, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2006. ACSAC '06. 22nd Annual",20061226,2006,,,449,462,"Access control and integrity constraints are well known approaches to ensure data integrity in commercial database systems. However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.",1063-9527,0-7695-2716-7,,10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189,,Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases,,,,4,,24,,,Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

One of the most important applications of decision making is in the field of anomaly detection. This can enable the detection of attacks in cyber-physical systems without requiring a complete description of the physical process. The novelty of our approach is that is combines reports of various cyber and physical sensors, rather than focusing on either one single metric, or one singe realm, as was the case of similar techniques. Based on the proposed architecture we implement a new cyber-physical anomaly detection system. We show that data fusion is much more effective if it combines both cyber and physical realms, rather than focusing on the two realms separately.",,978-1-4577-1313-2,,10.1109/SMFG.2011.6125763,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125763,Cyber-Physical systems;Smart Grid;anomaly detection systems;data fusion,Engines;Floods;Sensors,decision making;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids,cyber-physical systems;security;smart grid;theory of evidence-based automated decision making,,1,,14,,,14-16 Nov. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Impact of Sanitized Message Flows in a Cooperative Intrusion Warning System,"Tolle, J.; Jahnke, M.; Felde, N.G.; Martini, P.","Res. Establ. for Appl. Sci., Wachtberg","Military Communications Conference, 2006. MILCOM 2006. IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,7,"This paper discusses the side effects of sanitizing IT security event messages in a cooperative multi-domain intrusion warning system (IWS). To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow",,1-4244-0617-X,1-4244-0618-8,10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733,,Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology,Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security,IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities,,1,1,17,,,23-25 Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses. Accordingly, computer hosts met with malicious intrusions can be effectively detected via input signals and temporary output signals such as PAMP, danger and safe signals.",1098-7584,978-1-4244-7315-1,978-1-4244-7316-8,10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007564,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007564,artificial immune systems;dendritic cell algorithm;intrusion detection;multiagent,Adaptive systems;Computers;Context;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection,artificial immune systems;multi-agent systems;security of data,activation threshold;adaptive immune subsystem;agent-based artificial immune systems;artificial T-cell agents;computer host;danger theory;danger value calculation;dendritic cell functionality;dentritic cells agents;human immune system;innate immune subsystem;intrusion detection systems;malicious behaviors;malicious intrusions;mature context antigen value calculation;multiagent-based IDS;security operating center,,1,,14,,,27-30 June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Biologically inspired risk assessment in cyber security using neural networks,"Ionita, M.-G.; Patriciu, V.-V.","Mil. Tech. Acad., Bucharest, Romania","Communications (COMM), 2014 10th International Conference on",20140726,2014,,,1,4,"The only suitable option for risk assessment systems designed with real-time constraints in mind, in the present seems to be the one based on attack graphs. Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.",,,,10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746,attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment,Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management,computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management,Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data,,2,,10,,,29-31 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Our approach uses source code structures as patterns and introduces an iterative and interactive architecture recovery approach built upon such lower-level patterns extracted from source code.

Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a ""neighborhood watch"" concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it.

To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle.

During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data.

In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family, if the machines were found to be compromised. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities. Subsequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.",,,,10.1109/ICC.2014.6883391,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883391,,Correlation;Entropy;Internet;Malware;Unsolicited electronic mail,Internet;computer network security;cryptography;entropy;fuzzy reasoning;invasive software,Internet scale infections;darknet Internet;entropy based techniques;fuzzy hashing;inference;malware infection detection;network security operators;probing activities,,0,,27,,,10-14 June 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
A lightweight algorithm for traffic filtering over sliding windows,"Sanjuas-Cuxart, J.; Barlet-Ros, P.; Sole-Pareta, J.; Andriuzzi, G.","Dept. of Comp.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy.

DSN '07. 37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on",20070716,2007,,,10,19,"Although there are various ways to exploit software vulnerabilities for malicious attacks, the attacks always result in unexpected behavior in program execution, deviating from what the programmer/user intends to do. Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency.

First International Conference on",20100112,2009,,,13,20,"Data mining is the use of algorithms to extract the information and patterns derived by the knowledge discovery in databases process. Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation.

Trust Management for Encounter-Based Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks,Ing-Ray Chen; Fenye Bao; MoonJeong Chang; Jin-Hee Cho,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010), 2010 IEEE",20110110,2010,,,1,6,"We propose and analyze a class of trust management protocols for encounter-based routing in delay tolerant networks (DTNs). The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235,,Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols,Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes,DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol,,21,,15,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Detecting Anomaly Traffic using Flow Data in the real VoIP network,Hyeongu Son; Youngseok Lee,"Dept. of Comput. Eng., Chungnam Nat.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.",,978-1-4244-7526-1,978-0-7695-4107-5,10.1109/SAINT.2010.108,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131,IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow,Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication,Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN,BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN,,3,,16,,,19-23 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models.

However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks.

The various personal information sharing practices that social network providers promote have led to their success as innovative social interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it.

Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour.

In particular, many anomaly detection systems employ CFGs. Unfortunately, typical CFG-based systems rely on inaccurate or impractical heuristics. For example, the state space may be restricted by considering only a call graph, thus reducing accuracy and precision. In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

Behavioral analytics for inferring large-scale orchestrated probing events,"Bou-Harb, E.; Debbabi, M.; Assi, C.","NCFTA, Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC, Canada","Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), 2014 IEEE Conference on",20140708,2014,,,506,511,"The significant dependence on cyberspace has indeed brought new risks that often compromise, exploit and damage invaluable data and systems. Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed approach that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing events for early cyber attack warning and notification.",,,,10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849283,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849283,,Conferences;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Probes,IP networks;Internet;computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;information theory;invasive software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic,Internet traffic;coordination pattern;cyber attack;cyber threat intelligence;cyberspace;data mining methods;early cyber attack notification;early cyber attack warning;emergency response teams;fuzzy approaches;information theoretical metrics;large-scale orchestrated probing events;malicious activities;malicious real darknet data;malware traffic;network security analysts;orchestration pattern;routable unallocated IP addresses;signal techniques;statistical techniques,,0,,15,,,April 27 2014-May 2 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters.

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient.

Autonomic-computing approach to secure knowledge management: a game-theoretic analysis,"Arora, H.; Mishra, B.K.; Raghu, T.S.","Dept. of Inf. Syst., Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ","Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part A: Systems and Humans, IEEE Transactions on",20060515,2006,36,3,487,497,"The explosion of knowledge management systems (KMS) and the need for their wide accessibility and availability has created an urgent need for reassessing the security practices and policies in organizations. Security of these assets is a day-to-day job placing a tremendous cognitive load on information-technology (IT) professionals, which can make it almost impossible to manage the security aspects of KMS. Autonomic-computing systems are well suited to manage KMS, as they use high-level system objectives provided by administrators as the basis for managing the security of KMS. The authors model the self-protection and self-healing configuration attributes in autonomic systems through game-theoretic models. The proposed modeling approach progressively moves from a manual intervention-oriented security setup to an autonomic security setup. This allows the authors to compare and contrast the different approaches and provide insights on their applicability to different security environments. The authors find that moving to a partial autonomic system with self-healing mechanisms can provide a stable environment for securing enterprise knowledge assets and can reduce hacking.

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.",,,,10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947,Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis,Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines,Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines,Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine,,0,,21,,,24-26 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature.

Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified.

Based on the behavioral profiles, a two-level matching is used in identifying new traffic. We first determine if a host participates in the application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, for each flow of the host we compare if it matches with the patterns in the profiles to determine which flows belong to this application.

This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into one modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. The architecture achieves roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern-matching engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets.

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages.

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge.

An improved Hidden Markov Model for anomaly detection using frequent common patterns,"Sultana, A.; Hamou-Lhadj, A.; Couture, M.",,"Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on",20121129,2012,,,1113,1117,"Host-based intrusion detection techniques are needed to ensure the safety and security of software systems, especially, if these systems handle sensitive data. Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.",1550-3607,978-1-4577-2052-9,978-1-4577-2051-2,10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527,Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm,Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training,hidden Markov models;security of data,HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior,,2,,30,,,10-15 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Comparative study of a Hybrid Model for network traffic identification and its optimization using Firefly Algorithm,"Nascimento, Z.; Sadok, D.; Fernandes, S.","Inf. Center, Fed.

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts. Besides that, a optimizer called Firefly Algorithm was also used to enhance the results by optimizing both Apriori and SOM parameters and a comparative study was performed on both optimized and non-optimized models. The OHM showed to be superior to a non-optimized model for both eMule and Skype applications, reaching levels superior to 94% for correctness rate. The OHM was also validated against another model based on computational intelligence, named Realtime, and the OHM proposed in this work presented better results when tested in real time.",,,,10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755057,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755057,Association Rules;Firefly Algorithm;Network Traffic Measurement;Self-Organizing Maps,Association rules;Computational modeling;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems;Training,Internet;computer network management;cryptography;data mining;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;self-organising feature maps,Apriori;DPI;Internet;OHM;Realtime computational intelligence;SOM;Skype;association rules;deep packet inspection;eMule;encrypted data;firefly algorithm;hybrid model;network traffic classification;network traffic identification;optimized hybrid model;port-based inspection;rule-based model;self-organizing map;traffic volume,,1,,24,,,7-10 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

One of the researches introduced a fast method to detect attacks using modified information entropy (so called Fast Entropy). Fast Entropy shows the significant reduce of computational time compared to conventional entropy computation while it maintains detection accuracy. However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme. In addition, we found that Dynamic AFEA can enhance detection level more than fixed (non-dynamic) one when it is equipped with Fast Entropy.",,978-1-61284-733-7,978-0-7695-4372-7,10.1109/IMIS.2011.82,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976144,DDoS;Dynamic Adaptive Detector;Entropy based approach;Fast Infromatin Entropy,Accuracy;Computer crime;Detectors;Entropy;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring,Internet;entropy;security of data,Internet;adaptive DDoS attack detection using fast entropy approach;adaptive threshold shifting;distributed denial-of-service attacks;dynamic detection window size,,1,,11,,,June 30 2011-July 2 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector.

We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations.

Range Matching without TCAM Entries Expansion for Packet Classification,Yang Li; Chengwei Wan; Xiumei Fan,"Sch. of Comput.

Fourth International Conference on",20100119,2009,,,576,580,"Packet classification has been widely used in network security protection. A number of the major techniques for network security protection, such as virtual private networks (VPN), firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), are all dependent on the speed and ability of packet classification. The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion. By adding a new regional code, which is used to encode the ranges spanning two regions or more, the improved mechanism is able to express all the ranges by only one entry. Simulation and characteristics analysis of real rule-sets verify this encoding mechanism's feasibility and efficiency in actual applications.",,978-0-7695-3932-4,978-1-4244-5467-9,10.1109/FCST.2009.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392861,TCAM;entry expansion;packet classification;range matching,Computer science;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;National security;Protection;Quality of service;Routing;Virtual private networks;Wide area networks,computer network security;content-addressable storage;encoding;pattern matching,TCAM;encoding mechanism;entries expansion;network security protection;packet classification;range matching;ternary content addressable memory,,0,,14,,,17-19 Dec. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers.

By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists.

EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months.

To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages. We subject our dataset - consisting of malicious and normal SIP messages - to Euclidean distance-based classifiers as well as four standard classifiers. Our results show vast differences for Euclidean distance-based classifiers on our dataset than reported in current literature.

A Facebook event collector framework for profile monitoring purposes,"Fonseca, H.; Rocha, E.; Salvador, P.; Nogueira, A.; Gomes, D.","Inst. de Telecomun., Aveiro, Portugal","Computers and Communication (ISCC), 2014 IEEE Symposium on",20140929,2014,,,1,6,"Social networks have recently emerged to become vital tools for information and content dissemination among connections. Indeed, the immense increase of the number of users of Facebook made it rise to become the largest existing social network with more than 1.2 billion active users. However, these numbers also rose the attention of hackers and attackers who aim at propagating malware and viruses for obtaining confidential information regarding social network users. In this manner, it is crucial that each Facebook user is able to easily access, control and analyse the information shared on the corresponding profile so that profile usage deviations can be more efficiently detected. However, despite the fact that Facebook allows an analysis of all user actions through the Timeline Review, this information is not comprehensively organized and there is no statistical analysis of the user generated data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework comprising a Facebook event collector, which by being provided with an authentication token for a user profile obtained through a Facebook application developed for this purpose, collects all the corresponding posted information and stores it in a relational database for a posteriori analysis.

Attack diagnosis: throttling distributed denial-of-service attacks close to the attack sources,Ruiliang Chen; Jung-Min Park,"Bradley Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Virginia Polytech. Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, VA, USA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2005. ICCCN 2005. Proceedings. 14th International Conference on",20051031,2005,,,275,280,"Attack mitigation schemes actively throttle attack traffic generated in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.",1095-2055,0-7803-9428-3,,10.1109/ICCCN.2005.1523866,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523866,,Atherosclerosis;Computer crime;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic,IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services,DDoS attack;IP header;Internet protocol;PAD;Skitter Internet map;TTL field;attack diagnosis;attack mitigation scheme;counter-measure paradigm;distributed denial-of-service;global key distribution infrastructure;packet marking;parallel attack diagnosis;pushback marking;realistic network topology;transistor-transistor logic,,3,,17,,,17-19 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules.

While these attacks are very simple in implementation, their effect on WiFi networks can be devastating. To this end, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed to detect these attacks. In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network.

In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed.

The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold.

We propose an effective blacklist URL generation method. We try to discover the URLs in the neighborhood of a malicious URL by using a search engine. Those suspicious neighborhoods around malicious URLs require further investigation to determine their blacklisting candidacy.

PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters,"Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on",20090127,2008,,,73,80,"PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing.

RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees.

CTCP: a transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture for network security,Fu-Hau Hsu; Tzi-cker Chiueh,"Dept. of Comput.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead. On a 1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine with gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the throughput of the CTCP router is 420.3 Mbits/sec, whereas the throughput of a generic Linux router on the same hardware is only 409.1 Mbits/sec.",1063-9527,0-7695-2252-1,,10.1109/CSAC.2004.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377240,,Computer crime;Fingerprint recognition;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;RAKE receivers;Sockets;TCPIP;Throughput,Internet;Linux;open systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols,1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine;CTCP router prototype;Internet;Linux kernel;OS fingerprinting;gigabit Ethernet interface;network security;transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture,,2,,39,,,6-10 Dec. 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender.

The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses.

One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns.

Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks.

Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve overtime. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime. We propose a new methodology to associate the novelty patterns detected by the algorithm, in an unsupervised fashion, with the true classes.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives.

In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude.

We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored.

Misleading worm signature generators using deliberate noise injection,"Perdisci, R.; Dagon, D.; Wenke Lee; Fogla, P.; Sharif, M.","Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA","Security and Privacy, 2006 IEEE Symposium on",20060619,2006,,,15 pp.,31,"Several syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators, e.g., Polygraph, have recently been proposed. These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces ""noise"" due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process.

However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection. Our experiments show that the probability of a successful evasion is low, at about 0.98% in the worst case. We implement our approach in a prototype and present some preliminary results.

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks.

Detection of Bot Infected PCs Using Destination-Based IP and Domain Whitelists During a Non-Operating Term,"Takemori, K.; Nishigaki, M.; Takami, T.; Miyake, Y.","KDDI R&D Labs.

These attacks are considered to be sent from bot infected PCs. As a bot communicates with a malicious controller over an encrypted channel and updates its code frequently, it becomes difficult to detect infected personal computers (PCs) using pattern-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and antivirus systems (AVs). As sending attack and control packets from the bot process are independent of the user operation, a behavior monitor is effective to detect an anomaly communication. In this paper, we propose a bot detection technique that checks outbound packets with destination-based whitelists. If any outbound packets during the non-operating term do not match the whitelists, the PC is considered to be infected by the bot. The whitelists are a set of a destination IP address and/or domain names (DNs) that are listed by monitoring outbound packets from an un-infected PC. Because the many IPs and DNs are grouped into a few sub-networks and superior DNs, it is easier to maintain the destination-based whitelists than the pattern-based IDS/AV.

On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other.

A Payload driven Security model for flooding attacks in Active networks,"Jayashree, P.; Easwarakumar, K.S.; Radhakrishnan, D.; Lakshmanan, N.; Dinakaran, P.","Dept. of Inf. Technol., Anna Univ., Chennai","Advance Computing Conference, 2009. IACC 2009. IEEE International",20090331,2009,,,934,939,"In today's fast growing Internet world, the number of distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) is increasing at an alarming rate. Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm. This three-level filter was tested in the ANTS active network tool kit with the 1999 DARPA IDS dataset as the back end. Results validate the proposed scheme's efficiency and the time complexity of the filter proposed is smaller than IDS payload scanning methodologies.",,978-1-4244-2927-1,978-1-4244-2928-8,10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809140,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809140,ANTS;Anomaly detection;Distributed Denial of Service attack;Eigen Vector;Payload modeling;String matching,Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;message authentication;string matching;telecommunication security,DDoS attack;Internet;active network;distributed denial-of-service attack;eigen vector;flooding attack;intrusion detection system;optimal string matching algorithm;packet authenticity;packet payload data;payload driven security model,,1,1,11,,,6-7 March 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Low-power bloom filter architecture for deep packet inspection,"Kocak, T.; Kaya, I.","Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput.

Fourth International Conference on",20071218,2007,4,,67,71,"Various IDS devices produce large number of alert, the majority of which are false positives. It is laborious for the security officers to find real intrusions. To find intrusions in real time, we should first remove false positives in the alerts. According to the experience of IDS alerts analysis, we find that there are some regularities in alert flow occurrence: power law, trend, periodicity. Based on these statistical regularities, we can operate it based on time sequence effectively. The results of real world data analysis demonstrate that the method can reduce massive false positives in real time effectively.",,978-0-7695-2874-8,,10.1109/FSKD.2007.464,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406355,,Computer worms;Data analysis;Data models;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Linux;Machine learning;Protection;RNA;Real time systems,security of data;statistical analysis,data analysis;false positive removal;intrusion detection system;time sequence analysis,,1,,12,,,24-27 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Security events from IDS, firewall, and other security tools are currently growing at a rapid pace. However, most intrusion event researches focus on IDS alerts, overlooking other intrusion evidence from other security tools, or they make simple integration of various security tools not inflecting the whole network state. In this paper, we described network security from the view of system. First, network situation elements are analyzed. Second, we research their correlations and present system architecture of network security situation. Third, multi-sensor correlation algorithms are analyzed that colored Petri net is used for describing the changing of system state after arrival of new events and D-S theory of evidence is used for combining the different evidence.

Centralized surveillance of unused address space by using virtual networks,"Minohara, T.; Ishikawa, S.; Amano, M.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Takushoku Univ., Tokyo, Japan","Dependable Computing, 2005. Proceedings. 11th Pacific Rim International Symposium on",20060320,2005,,,8 pp.,,"Considerable attention has been paid to the Internet security. Honeypot is one of effective mechanism to detect and analyze intruders activities. Since packets sent to honeypots are almost always malicious, thus false alerts, that is serious problems in the normal intrusion detection system, are minimized. However, there are two important disadvantages in honeypot. First, the scope of a honeypot is limited to the address it attached. Second, there are potential risk that honeypot is compromised by a smart intruder. In this paper, we propose a centralized surveillance of unused address space. The whole unused addresses in the organization are virtually watched by a small number of the honeypots installed in a special network under the control. By the aggregation of honeypots, honeypots may be supervised well, and the risk of compromise may be reduced. The surveillance system can be established without making alternation in existing network equipments. It selects the address under surveillance autonomously. It is able to adapt to addition and deletion of networks and hosts without any administration.",,0-7695-2492-3,,10.1109/PRDC.2005.23,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607533,,Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Electronic mail;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Surveillance;Switches,Internet;surveillance;telecommunication security,Internet security;centralized surveillance;honeypot;unused address space surveillance;virtual networks,,0,1,10,,,12-14 Dec. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
