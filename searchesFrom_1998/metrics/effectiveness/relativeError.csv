Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs.

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064,,Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security,estimation theory;telecommunication security,detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity,,0,,17,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams,"Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on",20100524,2010,,,1,8,"In this work we consider the problem of monitoring information streams for anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies.

However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.",1932-4537,,,10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597,Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization,Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning,probability;security of data,SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager,,4,,41,,3/21/2012,Jun-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then use our vulnerability metric to evaluate a data structure which is commonly used in network mechanisms-the Hash table data structure. We show that Closed Hash is much more vulnerable to DDoS attacks than Open Hash, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent by traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queuing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems.

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory.
