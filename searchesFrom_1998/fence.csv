Design of a physical security perimeter fencing system,"Han Lin; Ross, M.; Mack, T.","Navy Phys. Security Dept., Sandia Nat. Labs., Albuquerque, NM, USA","Security Technology (ICCST), 2010 IEEE International Carnahan Conference on",20101230,2010,,,205,210,"Design of a physical security perimeter fencing system requires that security designers provide effective detection, delay, and response functionalities with minimal nuisance alarms. In addition, the designers must take into considerations the security fence system life cycle cost (equipment and grounds maintenance), complexity of the terrain, safety, and environmental conditions (location of where the security fence will be installed). Often, these factors drive the security designers to design a perimeter intrusion detection and assessment system (PIDAS) that includes: 1) larger than desired footprint, 2) one or more animal control fences to minimize the nuisance alarm rate (NAR), and 3) clear zones and an isolation zone to facilitate intrusion detection and assessment by keeping the fence lines clear of vegetation, trash, and other objects that could impede the security system's performance. This paper presents a two-tier PIDAS design that focuses on effective performance specifically in high probability of detection and low NAR that minimizes cost and the footprint of the system.",1071-6572,978-1-4244-7403-5,,10.1109/CCST.2010.5678719,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678719,Intrusion Detection;Perimeter;Physical Security,Animals;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optical fibers;Testing;Wire,life cycle costing;safety systems,facilitate intrusion detection;larger than desired footprint;life cycle cost;nuisance alarm rate;perimeter fencing system;perimeter intrusion detection and assessment system;physical security;security fence system;two-tier PIDAS design,,0,,5,,,5-8 Oct. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system using wireless sensor actuator network,"Ghatak, S.; Bose, S.; Roy, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Netaji Subhash Eng. Coll., Kolkata, India","Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), 2014 International Conference on",20141016,2014,,,1,5,"This paper presents the relative merits of IR and microwave sensor technology and their combination with wireless camera for the development of a wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system and explain the phases by which the intrusion information are collected and sent to the central control station using wireless mesh network for analysis and processing the collected data. These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.",,978-1-4799-2353-3,,10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795,IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network,Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks,GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network,,0,,14,,,3-5 Jan. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In particular, the analysis is focusing on the maximum sensing range in terms of azimuth angle, height, sensitivity level for indoor and outdoor implementation. With the help of IoT, sensor which detected motion on weak detection angle or signal could communicate through internet and get signal from nearby sensor for better detection signal. The WSN platform is developed using Octopus II sensor nodes while the microwave motion detector is HB100 which detect movement using Doppler effects. Octopus II will uplink all signal through internet and provide corresponding action of virtual fencing when intrusion detected. Results show maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit is decreasing as azimuth angle increasing.

The gait characteristic of a normal walker in the nature state is an average gait period of 1.2s, in which a step period is about 0.6s and a foot touchdown time is about 0.2s. When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.3–0.75s and a duration time of 0.15–0.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one.

In 1982, Siemens AG was the first company in this market which analysed all outdoor influences and recognised the essential problems which cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector to suffer from high unwanted false alarm rates. The result was that, already in 1984, a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created by Siemens AG which remains state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second.

Wireless sensors have become an excellent tool for military applications involving intrusion detection, perimeter monitoring, information gathering and smart logistics support in an unknown deployed area. Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model. In other words, we let our sensor network adapt to the norm of the dynamics in its natural surroundings so that any unusual activities can be singled out.

Does ldquono alarmrdquo mean no intruder is present or non-detection of an intruder? The consequence is ambiguity in interpreting the alarm status of an intrusion detection system. Two formulations, consistent with Dempster-Shafer theory, are presented that assist the security operator in distinguishing detections from nuisance alarms each time an alarm occurs, and distinguishing no activity from non-detection in the absence of any alarm. The first representation fuses multiple values of probability of detection or nuisance alarm likelihood, while retaining the dependence on factors (e.g., weather, terrain, intruder activity) that influence detection capability and nuisance alarm occurrence.

The first detection electronics and set-ups were designed for indoor use (jewellery shops, museums, etc..) but in 1964 the first capacitive detectors for outdoor use i.e. perimeter security systems appeared on the market with very poor performance results. During the 1970's and 80's and sometimes over very long periods, several world wide electronic companies tried to create good working solutions using simple and inexpensive hardware for outdoor use. Sometimes excellent ideas were integrated in the electronic design but generally any investment in a innovative hardware design such as (Insulators, wiring, etc...) were poorly supported. In 1982 Siemens AG was the first company in this market which analysed all outdoor influences and who recognised the essential problems which cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector suffering from high unwanted false alarm rates. This was even if the newest sophisticated digital electronics and algorithms were used. The result was that already in 1984 a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created and patented by Siemens AG which remains state of the art even now and which is making capacitive detectors work under most of all environmental conditions. Nevertheless even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects. These effects change the field, periodically generating very high false alarm rates which are extremely difficult to detect and to measure. The reason is that the false alarm rate is specific to a site and as such is difficult to identify. It is a fact that even well trained system engineers have difficulty in solving such problems. This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a coincidental combination of seaside conditions and a local desert wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive i.e. electrostatic field detector and where trivial (but expensive) measures needed to be taken to finally solve the problem",,0-7803-5965-8,,10.1109/CCST.2000.891181,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891181,,Capacitance measurement;Consumer electronics;Detectors;Electrostatics;Hardware;Insulation;Intrusion detection;Investments;Security;Wiring,electric fields;safety systems,electrostatic field detector;intrusion detection;local desert wind;perimeter security systems;seaside conditions,,1,,4,,,2000,23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Due to the vast size, remoteness and other geographical confines of border regions, technical solutions are necessary to complement the limitations of manpower. In this paper we discuss our research in developing a system for detecting border intrusion activity by combining wireless sensor networks with artificial neural networks (ANNs). The key idea is to use ANN models to discover distinct patterns that describe an intrusion activity and use these patterns to train the ANN model which will then recognize intrusions and other abnormalities. We present a border intrusion detection system in which light and sound data from low-cost sensor motes spread out on the field is used to help ANNs make automated decisions and report intrusion activity.

Algorithms are used to analyze potential consequences, the relative importance of targets to the adversary, and security vulnerability levels, to arrive at a relative risk for each threat and target combination. Countermeasures are then developed to minimize the risk and the methodology is reapplied to determine the relative risk reduction achieved. This iterative process is continued until the most cost-effective method for reducing risk to an acceptable level is identified.

Outdoor perimeter security sensors a forty year perspective,"Harman, K.; Messner, W.K.","Harman Analytics, Almonte, ON, Canada","Security Technology (ICCST), 2012 IEEE International Carnahan Conference on",20121231,2012,,,1,9,"Outdoor perimeter security sensors have played, and continue to play, an important role in the security of critical assets and VIP residents over the past 40 years. In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as “Slow-Tech” in a “High-Tech” world. In “High-Tech” we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the “Slow-Tech” world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the “real world” of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This “mil-spec” environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small “spin-off” one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited. More recently most of one product companies have merged into larger “one-stop-shopping” companies. This paper describes the many changes in technology, the business models and the user community over the past 40 years and concludes with a prediction as to what the next 10 years will bring.",1071-6572,978-1-4673-2450-2,978-1-4673-2449-6,10.1109/CCST.2012.6393530,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393530,,Companies;Government;Industries;Military aircraft;Security;Sensor systems,military equipment;national security;sensors,Carnahan Conference;IEEE sponsorship;US military;VIP residents;aerospace companies;business models;critical assets;forty year perspective;high-tech world;mil-spec environment;military developments;one-stop-shopping companies;outdoor environment;outdoor perimeter security sensors;perimeter security equipment;sensor technology;slow-tech world;threats;user community,,0,,13,,,15-18 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Existing perimeter is layered of border routers, firewalls, IDS, IPS, VPN devices, software architecture over DMZs and subnets, beside server and host filters and antivirus applications. These are not fully customizable against adversaries in providing strong security framework. The current deployment nature of security perimeter where these layered components are prone to various egress and ingress nasty activities raises some serious questions. The traditional perimeters do not provide sufficient security to overcome these limitations in order to provide uncompromised security nodes [3][11][12]. To address security needs efficiently, at critical knots within a network, we introduce a security framework. The proposed framework focuses three key areas related to defense-in-depth; (1) maximizing synchronization among layered security services (2) modularizing various services for better endpoint security (3) reducing traffic while providing secure mechanism for encrypted updates in traditional networks.

This leads to low SNR, making high-precision positioning a great challenge. In this paper, a distributed double-loop Sagnac interferometer system based fiber optic sensor is designed and validated in field for detecting and locating intruders.

Genetic algorithm based optimization technique for underwater sensor network positioning and deployment,"Iyer, S.; Rao, D.V.","Inst. for Syst. Studies & Anal., Delhi, India","Underwater Technology (UT), 2015 IEEE",20150518,2015,,,1,6,"Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWSNs) are crucial for a multitude of underwater applications that require wireless operation. The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application. In the case of a civil application for ocean monitoring, the proposed technique is used to identify the minimum number of nodes required and their positions for effective communication.",,978-1-4799-8299-8,,10.1109/UT.2015.7108229,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108229,deployment strategy;genetic algorithm;modeling;simulation;underwater acoustic sensor network,Genetic algorithms;Monitoring;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Temperature sensors;Three-dimensional displays,genetic algorithms;oceanographic techniques;pH;sensor placement;telecommunication power management;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks,HVA;UWSN;computational intelligence techniques;energy constraints;genetic algorithm;high-value asset;ocean monitoring;physical network layout;sensor nodes;transmission frequency;underwater acoustic sensor networks;underwater sensor network positioning;wireless operation,,0,,21,,,23-25 Feb. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Intrepid MicroTrack leaky cable sensor,"Harman, R.K.","Southwest Microwave Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA","Security Technology, 2002. Proceedings. 36th Annual 2002 International Carnahan Conference on",20021210,2002,,,191,197,"Intrepid MicroTrack is the first leaky coaxial cable sensor to utilize FM CW radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables. MicroTrack uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to translate the swept frequency response into precise target location. The frequency diversity associated with the ultra wide bandwidth assures uniform detection along the length of the sensor cable. MicroTrack complies with radio regulatory requirements for low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors in the HF band.",,0-7803-7436-3,,10.1109/CCST.2002.1049250,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049250,,Acoustic pulses;Acoustic sensors;Acoustic signal detection;Coaxial cables;Hafnium;Leak detection;Microwave sensors;Radar detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Ultra wideband radar,CW radar;access control;coaxial cables;fast Fourier transforms;radar applications;radar signal processing;sensors,FM CW radar techniques;Intrepid MicroTrack leaky coaxial cable sensor;barrier mounted applications;buried applications;digital processing components;fast Fourier transform;high speed high resolution analog to digital converters;intruder detection;intruder location;low cost direct digital synthesis chips;low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors;precise target location;radio regulatory requirements;surface applications;swept frequency response translation;ultra wide band HF terrain following radar,,4,2,6,,,2002,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies.

In the absence of a global worm detection system, we examine the effectiveness of local worm detection and response strategies. This paper makes three contributions: (1) we propose a simple two-phase local worm victim detection algorithm, DSC (Destination-Source Correlation), based on worm behavior in terms of both infection pattern and scanning pattern. DSC can detect zero-day scanning worms with a high detection rate and very low false positive rate. (2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of early worm warning based on local victim information. For example, warning occurs with 0.19% infection of all vulnerable hosts on Internet when using a /12 monitored network.

Commercial Video Motion Detection (VMD) and Intelligent Scene Monitoring (ISM) systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Image processing is traditionally concerned with preprocessing operations such as Fourier filtering, edge detection and morphological operations. Computer vision extends the image processing paradigm to include understanding of scene content, tracking and object classification. Examples of computer vision applications include Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), people and vehicle tracking, crowd analysis and model based vision. Often image processing and computer vision techniques are developed with highly specific applications in mind and the goal of a more global understanding computer vision system remains outside the bounds of present technology.

Cyber/physical security vulnerability assessment integration,"Macdonald, D.; Clements, S.L.; Patrick, S.W.; Perkins, C.; Muller, G.; Lancaster, M.J.; Hutton, W.","Pacific Northwest Nat. Lab. Richland, Richland, WA, USA","Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT), 2013 IEEE PES",20130415,2013,,,1,6,"Securing high value and critical assets is one of the biggest challenges facing this nation and others around the world. In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: 1 physical only attack, 2 cyber only attack, 3 physical-enabled cyber attack, 4 cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising.

However, the current specification didn't resolve the problem of automatic key management. Even though several solutions have been proposed, such as CGA and ABK, the implementations for IPv6 are still far away from completeness. This paper presents an approach of security gateway to effectively detect the security threats or illegal access attempts to IPv6 WLAN. By taking the advantages of wireless technology for mobility as well as IPv6 features, the security gateway is capable of offering precautionary reports for potential intrusions, attacks, or system vulnerabilities before a global IP being determined. The gateway is composed of traffic collection unit, traffic processing unit, behavior analysis unit, response unit, authentication unit, and policy management unit. With monitoring and analyzing the communication traffic from the managed devices, using the widely available tools from SNMP, ICMP, DHCP, and RADIUS, the security gateway provides an elegant solution to filter most illegal accesses to wireless IPv6 networks",,0-7695-2613-6,,10.1109/ICIS-COMSAR.2006.76,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1651974,IPv6;Network Management;Security Gateway;WLAN,Access protocols;Authentication;Communication standards;Communication system security;Computer science;Information security;National security;Network servers;Routing;Wireless LAN,IP networks;internetworking;message authentication;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN,DHCP;ICMP;IETF standards;IPsec authentication header;IPv6 WLAN illegal access;RADIUS;SNMP;authentication unit;automatic key management;behavior analysis unit;communication traffic monitoring;policy management unit;response unit;security gateway;traffic collection unit;traffic processing unit,,0,,27,,,10-12 July 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

These attacks are more difficult to detect than the flooding DDoS attacks. This paper explores the energy distributions of Internet traffic flows in frequency domain. Normal TCP traffic flows present periodicity because of protocol behavior. Our results reveal that normal TCP flows can be segregated from malicious flows according to energy distribution properties. We discover the spectral shifting of attack flows from that of normal flows. Combining flow-level spectral analysis with sequential hypothesis testing, we propose a novel defense scheme against RoQ attacks.

Even on a small network, manual analysis of network traffic is inefficient and extremely time consuming. Current machine processing techniques, while fast, suffer from an unacceptable percentage of false positives and false negatives. To complement both manual and automated analysis of network traffic, we applied information visualization techniques to appropriately and effectively bring the human into the analytic loop. This paper describes the implementation and lessons learned from the creation of a novel network traffic visualization system capable of both realtime and forensic data analysis. Combining the strength of link analysis using parallel coordinate plots with the time-sequence animation of scatter plots, we examine a 2D and 3D coordinated display that provides insight into both legitimate and malicious network activity.

The attackers' potential influence on the tactical assessments produced by standard alert correlation systems,"Neville, S.W.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Victoria Univ., BC, Canada","Secure Network Protocols, 2005. (NPSec). 1st IEEE ICNP Workshop on",20051114,2005,,,61,66,"This work shows that knowledgeable attackers can influence the tactical assessments output by INFOSEC alert correlation systems solely through manipulating the timing characteristics of their attacks. The approach taken is to assume that the defender's goal is to thwart attackers by enact optimal tactical responses. It is then shown that, even in an idealized environment, the defender has no guarantee that the correlation system's estimates of the enacted attacks are correct. A theoretical path always exists by which the attacker can influence the contents of the correlation system's low-level alert clusters. As these low-level clusters form the basis of all higher level analyses, this is sufficient to show that the attacker has influence over the tactical assessments reported by correlation systems. In essence, the attackers can cause the defender to mis-correlate an attack's generated INFOSEC alerts in a manner which can go undetected and is to the attacker's advantage. This capability is shown to hinge on there being attacks whose identification requires the analysis of shared alerts (i.e., alerts generated by two or more distinct attacks).",,0-7803-9427-5,,10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532055,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532055,,Councils;Fasteners;Game theory;Large-scale systems;Performance analysis;Pressing;Production;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control,military communication;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security,network security;standard alert correlation systems;tactical assessments;timing characteristics,,0,,23,,,6 Nov. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Integrated Perimeter Security System,"Hennin, S.; Germana, G.; Garcia, L.","Raytheon Co., Marlborough","Technologies for Homeland Security, 2007 IEEE Conference on",20070611,2007,,,70,75,"The protection of critical infrastructure is a growing concern within the transportation industry. Raytheon is developing a system architecture and design for a perimeter security system that specifically addresses this issue for large facilities such as airports, seaports and rail facilities. The architecture uses the DoD's Architecture Framework guidelines. It employs a multi-sensor approach, including ground surveillance radars and cameras, to detect, assess and track perimeter incursions. It is designed to operate 24/7 in all weather conditions. A command and control center provides timely and accurate situational awareness to facility security personnel responsible for monitoring and managing incidents. Mobile communications also provide situational awareness to first responders in the field. The architecture supports integration with existing security systems, such as access control and closed circuit television, to centralize security monitoring for the entire facility. This architecture is the basis for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Perimeter Intrusion Detection System for four airports, including John F. Kennedy International. Raytheon's system engineering process as applied to the perimeter security application is described, with focus on the key early process phases of threat analysis, operational concept generation, system requirements analysis, and system architecture and design development. Key technical parameters, including probability of detection and nuisance alarm rate, that drive the system design and cost are also discussed.
