In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching.

A resource efficient content inspection system for next generation Smart NICs,"Sabhanatarajan, K.; Gordon-Ross, A.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL","Computer Design, 2008. ICCD 2008. IEEE International Conference on",20090119,2008,,,156,163,"The aggregate power consumption of the Internet is increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the rapid increase in the number of connected edge devices such as desktop PCs. Despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of PCs have their power management features disabled. Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection.

Auto-unpacked contains self-decryption algorithms, where the script codes help quickly decipher script bodies for further analysis. Heuristic analysis is designed to analyze disassemble code contain within a suspicious program. The disassemble code of the suspicious file is compared with a known virus signature database. If the disassemble code matches with the code of the database signature, the file is flagged. The emulator is design to scans code, imitates the way they are executing, and monitoring their actions, preventing any actual damage from being dealt to the computer system or user data. Verdicts on whether or not a program poses a threat are issued based on the results of behaviour analyses.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as virus free by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048  128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area.

Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of no-match cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of bad but cheap hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for on-access virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user.

An Efficient and Scalable Pattern Matching Scheme for Network Security Applications,Tsern-Huei Lee; Nai-Lun Huang,"Dept. of Commun. Eng., Nat. Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu","Computer Communications and Networks, 2008. ICCCN '08. Proceedings of 17th International Conference on",20081117,2008,,,1,7,"Because of its accuracy, pattern matching technique has recently been applied to Internet security applications such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-virus, and anti-malware. Among various famous pattern matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick (AC) can match multiple pattern strings simultaneously with worst-case performance guarantee and is adopted in both Clam antivirus (ClamAV) and Snort intrusion detection open sources. The AC algorithm is based on finite automaton which can be implemented straightforwardly with a two-dimensional state transition table. However, the memory requirement prohibits such an implementation when the total length of the pattern strings is large. The ClamAV implementation limits the depth of the finite automaton and combines with linked lists to reduce memory requirement. The banded-row format is adopted to compress the state transition table and used as an alternative pattern matching machine in Snort. In this paper we present a novel implementation which requires small memory space and achieves high throughput performance.

Scalable multi-pipeline architecture for high performance multi-pattern string matching,"Weirong Jiang; Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources.

At the heart of such services is a signature matching engine that must match packet payloads to multiple signatures at line rates. However, the recent transition to complex regular-expression based signatures coupled with ever-increasing network speeds has rapidly increased the performance requirements of signature matching. Solutions to meet these requirements range from hardware-centric ASIC/FPGA implementations to software implementations using high-performance microprocessors. In this paper, we propose a programmable signature matching system prototyped on an Nvidia G80 GPU. We first present a detailed architectural and microarchitectural analysis, showing that signature matching is well suited for SIMD processing because of regular control flow and parallelism available at the packet level. Next, we examine two approaches for matching signatures: standard deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and extended finite automata (XFAs), which use far less memory than DFAs but require specialized auxiliary memory and small amounts of computation in most states.

Such mechanisms require the network to inspect the packet payload at line rates to detect and filter those packets containing worm signatures.

PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters,"Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on",20090127,2008,,,73,80,"PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle.

The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the Search phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.",,978-0-7695-2858-9,,10.1109/ICNS.2007.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321,,Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system,,0,,15,,,19-25 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

Our proposed architecture partitions the (8-bit) character input into several bit-field inputs of smaller (usually 2-bit) widths. Each bit-field input is matched in a partial state machine (PSM) pipeline constructed from the respective bit-field patterns. The matching results from all the bit-fields in every pipeline stage are then merged with the help of an auxiliary table (ATB). This novel architecture essentially divides the LSSM problem with a continuous stream of input characters into two disjoint and simpler sub-problems: 1) O(character_bitwidth) number of pipeline traversals, and 2) O(pattern_length) number of table lookups. It is naturally suitable for implementation on FPGA or VLSI with on-chip memory.

A High-Performance Memory-Efficient Pattern Matching Algorithm and Its Implementation,Tsern-Huei Lee; Chia-Chi Liang,"Dept. of Commun. Eng., Nat.

Among the various pattern matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick (AC) can match multiple pattern strings simultaneously with worst-case performance guarantee and thus is widely adopted. However, the throughput performance of the original AC may not be satisfactory for high speed environments because only one symbol is processed in an operation cycle. In this paper we present an extension of the AC algorithm where multiple symbols are processed in an operation cycle to improve throughput performance. In our proposed scheme, all pattern strings, and the input text string as well, are divided into K substrings, if K symbols are processed in an operation cycle. Moreover, K pattern search engines are employed to scan the text substrings in parallel. As a result, the throughput performance can be improved by K times.

Virtualization offers a compelling platform for malware analysis, with strong isolation and the ability to save and restore guest state. Current virtual machine monitors (VMMs), however, are not designed for malware analysis. Due to their complexity, they often fail to provide transparency and even expose vulnerabilities which could be exploited by the malware running inside guest system. We propose a lightweight VMM (namely MAVMM) that is designed specially for a single job: malware analysis. MAVMM does not implement unnecessary virtualization features commonly found in general purpose hypervisors, including virtual device emulation. We take advantage of hardware virtualization support to make MAVMM more simple, secure and transparent. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of MAVMM, and the features that we can extract from programs running inside the guest OS.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications.

Unfortunately, regular expressions require considerably more resources in matching over fixed binary or character strings. Much research has focused on improving matching architectures or hardware support to create more efficient regular expression matching. This research, however, investigated whether or not the regular expression set itself contained any lever that might make for creating more efficient automata prior to moving such automata to any specific matching architecture or hardware. We found that typical Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) construction methodologies create redundant paths in the NFA when used with the complex rule-sets employed in network security. This stems directly from the fact that creating optimized NFA is a hard problem. As such, we created REduce, a tool that uses shared prefixes among regular expressions as a heuristic to eliminate redundant paths among shared prefixes within constructed NFA. The end result is smaller matching automata (between 4-50% depending on the rule-set) and a 4-900% improvement in throughput due to reductions in active state. More importantly, REduce only targets NFA construction, thus the generated NFA can be converted to any specific matching architecture or hardware for cumulative improvement.",,,,10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288457,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288457,,Automata;Communication networks;Complexity theory;Electronic mail;Hardware;Redundancy;Security,computer network security;finite automata;redundancy,NFA construction methodologies;antivirus;character strings;fixed binary strings;matching automata;network intrusion detection;network security systems;non-deterministic finite automata construction methodologies;optimized NFA;redundant paths;regular expression matching;shared prefixes;spam email filtering,,,,,,,3-6 Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

In recent years many of these tools use visualization designed to make traffic patterns and impact of an attack tangible to a security analyst. The visualizations attempt to facilitate understanding elements of an attack, including the location of malicious activity on a network and the consequences for the wider system. The human observer is able to detect patterns from useful visualizations, and so discover new knowledge about existing data sets. Because of human reasoning, such approaches still have an advantage over automated detection, data-mining and analysis. The core challenge still lies in using the appropriate visualization at the right time. It is this lack of situational awareness that our CyberVis framework is designed to address. In this paper we present a novel approach to the visualization of enterprise network attacks and their subsequent potential consequences. We achieve this by combining traditional network diagram icons with Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN), a risk-propagation logic that connects the network and business-process and task layer, and a flexible alert input schema able to support intrusion alerts from any third-party sensor. Rather than overwhelming a user with excessive amounts of information, CyberVis abstracts the visuals to show only noteworthy information about attack data and indicates potential impact both across the network and on enterprise tasks. CyberVis is designed with the Human Visual System (HVS) in mind, so severe attacks (or many smaller attacks that make up a large risk) appear more salient than other components in the scene.

Bloom filter engines are used in front-end for membership query which can achieve high performance, and an lookup table is used in back-end to performance deterministic string-matching.

Creating a specialized mobile version of each desired service that incorporates an appropriate level of security protection and quality of service (QoS) for the tactical users is one possibility. Such an approach is not cost effective, however, as the market for a given tactical application is small compared to the commercial user base for mobile applications and services.

Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata,"Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr. Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","INFOCOM, 2011 Proceedings IEEE",20110630,2011,,,1853,1861,"Regular expression matching (REM) with nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) can be computationally expensive when a large number of patterns are matched concurrently. On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(||p<sup>2</sup>(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where  is the alphabet and c  1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-9919-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986,Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching,NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,,11,,26,,,10-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms.

SplitScreen performs an additional screening step prior to the signature matching phase found in existing approaches. The screening step filters out most non-infected files (90%) and also identifies malware signatures that are not of interest (99%). The screening step significantly improves end-to-end performance because safe files are quickly identified and are not processed further, and malware files can subsequently be scanned using only the signatures that are necessary. Our approach naturally leads to a network-based anti-malware solution in which clients only receive signatures they needed, not every malware signature ever created as with current approaches. We have implemented SplitScreen as an extension to ClamAV, the most popular open source anti-malware software.

Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve overtime. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime.

This area has been widely studied and solutions typically use data not freely available. A labeled available network traffic flow dataset, Kyoto2006+, has been recently created. Most existing works using Kyoto2006+ for network anomaly detection, apply various clustering approaches. Clustering approaches typically require thresholds for minimum size or distance, or the number of clusters. Results could be sensitive to the selection of such thresholds. This paper leverages existing spectral analysis and statistical analysis techniques for network anomaly detection. One well known spectral analysis technique is Haar Wavelet filtering analysis. It measures the amount and magnitude of abrupt changes in data. Another popular approach is a statistical analysis technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA describes data in a new dimension to unlock otherwise hidden characteristics. Both approaches have strengths and limitations. In response, this paper proposes a Hybrid PCA-Haar Wavelet Analysis; a modified PCA which incorporates time shifting to account for changes over time is considered. In addition, the hybrid approach uses PCA to describe the data and Haar Wavelet filtering for analysis. Based on prototyping and measurement, an investigation of the Hybrid PCA-Haar Wavelet Analysis technique is performed using the Kyoto2006+ dataset.

Because conventional countermeasures deployed on the boundary between the Internet and the internal network will not work adequately, monitoring on the internal network becomes indispensable. In this paper, we propose an integrated sandbox system that deploys a secure and transparent proxy to analyze internal malicious network traffic. The adoption of software defined networking technology makes it possible to redirect any internal traffic from/to a suspicious host to the system for an examination of its insidiousness. When our system finds malicious activity, the traffic is blocked. If the malicious traffic is regarded as mandatory, e.g., For controlled delivery, the system works as a transparent proxy to bypass it. For benign traffic, the system works as a transparent proxy, as well.

The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory.

High performance string matching algorithm for a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS),"Weinsberg, Y.; Tzur-David, S.; Dolev, D.; Anker, T.",Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem,"High Performance Switching and Routing, 2006 Workshop on",20061016,2006,,,7 pp.,,"Intrusion detection systems (IDS) were developed to identify and report attacks in the late 1990s, as hacker attacks and network worms began to affect the Internet. Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection.

TaintScope: A Checksum-Aware Directed Fuzzing Tool for Automatic Software Vulnerability Detection,Tielei Wang; Tao Wei; Guofei Gu; Wei Zou,"Key Lab. of Network & Software Security Assurance, Peking Univ., Beijing, China","Security and Privacy (SP), 2010 IEEE Symposium on",20100708,2010,,,497,512,"Fuzz testing has proven successful in finding security vulnerabilities in large programs. However, traditional fuzz testing tools have a well-known common drawback: they are ineffective if most generated malformed inputs are rejected in the early stage of program running, especially when target programs employ checksum mechanisms to verify the integrity of inputs. In this paper, we present TaintScope, an automatic fuzzing system using dynamic taint analysis and symbolic execution techniques, to tackle the above problem. TaintScope has several novel contributions: 1) TaintScope is the first checksum-aware fuzzing tool to the best of our knowledge. It can identify checksum fields in input instances, accurately locate checksum-based integrity checks by using branch profiling techniques, and bypass such checks via control flow alteration. 2) TaintScope is a directed fuzzing tool working at X86 binary level (on both Linux and Window). Based on fine-grained dynamic taint tracing, TaintScope identifies which bytes in a well-formed input are used in security-sensitive operations (e.g., invoking system/library calls) and then focuses on modifying such bytes. Thus, generated inputs are more likely to trigger potential vulnerabilities. 3) TaintScope is fully automatic, from detecting checksum, directed fuzzing, to repairing crashed samples. It can fix checksum values in generated inputs using combined concrete and symbolic execution techniques. We evaluate TaintScope on a number of large real-world applications. Experimental results show that TaintScope can accurately locate the checksum checks in programs and dramatically improve the effectiveness of fuzz testing. TaintScope has already found 27 previously unknown vulnerabilities in several widely used applications, including Adobe Acrobat, Google Picasa, Microsoft Paint, and ImageMagick. Most of these severe vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Secunia and oCERT, and assigned CVE identifiers (such as CVE-2009-1882, CVE-200- - 9-2688).

These techniques makes the discovery of API-calling behavior become more complex than before. In this paper, we illustrate some methods which are commonly used by malware writers to obscure their API-calling behavior when they write their malware in assembly language.

Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state.

The proposed QSV method is based on quick sampling of the input stream against fixed-length pattern prefixes, and on-demand verification of variable-length pattern suffixes. Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure.

Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC.

Properties such as self healing, self hiding and ability to deceive the security devices make these software hard to detect and mitigate. Therefore, the detection and the mitigation of such malicious software is a major challenge for researchers and security personals. The conventional systems for the detection and mitigation of such threats are mostly signature based systems. Major drawback of such systems are their inability to detect malware samples for which there is no signature available in their signature database. Such malwares are known as zero day malware. Moreover, more and more malware writers uses obfuscation technology such as polymorphic and metamorphic, packing, encryption, to avoid being detected by antivirus. Therefore, the traditional signature based detection system is neither effective nor efficient for the detection of zero-day malware. Hence to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of malware detection system we are using classification method based on structural information and behavioral specifications. In this paper we have used both static and dynamic analysis approaches. In static analysis we are extracting the features of an executable file followed by classification.

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

A Memory Efficient Multiple Pattern Matching Architecture for Network Security,Tian Song; Wei Zhang; Dongsheng Wang; Yibo Xue,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

A Memory-Efficient and Modular Approach for String Matching on FPGAs,"Hoang Le; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.",,978-0-7695-4056-6,978-1-4244-7143-0,10.1109/FCCM.2010.37,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050,FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching,Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching,FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree,,2,,17,,,2-4 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

As Internet telephony becomes more and more popular, attackers will attempt to exhaustively test implementations' robustness, transmitting various types of malformed messages to them. Since it is almost infeasible to avoid or predict every potential error caused during the developing process of these subsystems, it is necessary to specify an appropriate and robust, from the security point of view, framework that will facilitate the successful detection and handling of any kind of malformed messages aiming to destruct the provided service.

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface.

Existing DFA-based approaches always tradeoff between memory and throughput, no known approach has the best of both worlds. Hence, they fail to be used in the embedded systems like high speed routers where only limited on-chip resources are available. This post proposes a multi-step string matching acceleration scheme named step Finite Automata (Step-FA). Different from classical string matching approaches, we suppose to match an additional structural characteristic named as the distance of certain characters in Step-FA rather than the pure explicit characters themselves. As Step-FA does not follow each-byte-one-memory-access manner in the classical DFA, a high speedup can be achieved meanwhile the memory requirement decreased sharply. The Step-DFA gives the trade-off between accurate and approximate matching. For the purpose of guaranteeing he equivalence between the Step-FA and DFA, a verification module is introduced to fast check the already matched results. Experimental evaluations with ClamAV show that a 6 times of speedup can be practically achieved by a single Step-FA Matching System with a 70% reduced memory comparing to the up-to-date DFA-based approaches.",,978-1-4244-6739-6,978-1-4244-6739-6,10.1109/INFCOMW.2010.5466687,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466687,,Acceleration;Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Pattern matching;Throughput,computer network security;computer networks;computer viruses;embedded systems;finite automata;formal verification,NIDS;Step-FA;accelerating multistring matching;antivirus scanners;compact finite automaton;embedded systems;finite automata;network intrusion detection systems;network security applications;real time systems;verification module,,0,,5,,,15-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average skip distance, while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV.

Space-time tradeoffs in software-based deep Packet Inspection,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Harchol, Y.; Hay, D.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya, Israel","High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR), 2011 IEEE 12th International Conference on",20110818,2011,,,1,8,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) lies at the core of contemporary Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems and Web Application Firewalls. DPI aims to identify various malware (including spam and viruses) by inspecting both the header and the payload of each packet and comparing it to a known set of patterns. DPI is often performed on the critical path of the packet processing, thus the overall performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of DPI. The seminal algorithm of Aho-Corasick (AC) is the de facto standard for pattern matching in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Basically, the AC algorithm constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for detecting all occurrences of a given set of patterns by processing the input in a single pass. The input is inspected symbol by symbol (usually each symbol is a byte), such that each symbol results in a state transition. Thus, in principle, the AC algorithm has deterministic performance, which does not depend on specific input and therefore is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks, making it very attractive to NIDS systems. In this paper we show that, when implementing the AC algorithm in software, this property does not hold, due to the fact that contemporary pattern sets induce very large DFAs that cannot be stored entirely in cache. We then propose a novel technique to compress the representation of the Aho-Corasick automaton, so it can fit in modern cache. We compare both the performance and the memory footprint of our technique to previously-proposed implementation, under various settings and pattern sets. Our results reveal the space-time tradeoffs of DPI. Specifically, we show that our compression technique reduces the memory footprint of the best prior-art algorithm by approximately 60%, while achieving comparable throughput.",,978-1-4244-8454-6,978-1-4244-8455-3,10.1109/HPSR.2011.5985996,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985996,,Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Encoding;Pattern matching;Software;Software algorithms;Throughput,Internet;authorisation;computer networks,AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick automaton;DPI;NIDS systems;Web application firewalls;algorithmic complexity attacks;compression technique;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet processing;prevention systems;software-based deep;space-time tradeoffs;state transition,,5,,25,,,4-6 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

A Memory-Efficient and Modular Approach for Large-Scale String Pattern Matching,"Hoang Le; Prasanna, V.K.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Much work has been done in this field; however, most of the prior work results in low memory efficiency (defined as the ratio of the amount of the required storage in bytes and the size of the dictionary in number of characters). Due to such inefficiency, state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose an algorithm called leaf-attaching to preprocess a given dictionary without increasing the number of patterns. The resulting set of postprocessed patterns can be searched using any tree-search data structure.

The proposed algorithm and architecture achieve a memory efficiency of 0.56 (for the Rogets dictionary) and 1.32 (for the Snort dictionary). As a result, our design scales well to support larger dictionaries. Implementations on 45 nm ASIC and a state-of-the-art FPGA device (for latest Rogets and Snort dictionaries) show that our architecture achieves 24 and 3.2 Gbps, respectively. The MASM module can simply be duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle.

We propose a novel method to extract the partial strings from each pattern which maximizes search speed.

Sci., Higher Colleges of Technol., United Arab Emirates","Innovations in Information Technology (INNOVATIONS), 2014 10th International Conference on",20141218,2014,,,93,98,"Security has been always treated as an add-on feature in the software development lifecycle, and addressed by security professionals using firewalls, proxies, intrusion prevention systems, antivirus and platform security. Software is at the root of all common computer security problems, and hence hackers don't create security holes, but rather exploit them. Security holes in software applications are the result of bad design and implementation of software systems and applications. To address this problem, several initiatives for integrating security in the software development lifecycle have been proposed, along with tools to support a security-centric software development lifecycle. This paper introduces a framework for evaluating security static analysis tools such as source code analyzers, and offers evaluation of non-commercial static analysis tools such as Yasca, CAT.NET, and FindBugs. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of such tools, common software weaknesses are defined based on CWE/SANS Top 25, OWASP Top Ten and NIST source code weaknesses. The evaluation methodology is based on the NIST Software Assurance Metrics And Tool Evaluation (SAMATE). Results show that security static analysis tools are, to some extent, effective in detecting security holes in source code; source code analyzers are able to detect more weaknesses than bytecode and binary code scanners; and while tools can assist the development team in security code review activities, they are not enough to uncover all common weaknesses in software.

A Multi-dimensional Progressive Perfect Hashing for High-Speed String Matching,"Yang Xu; Lei Ma; Zhaobo Liu; Chao, H.J.","ECE Dept., NYU, Brooklyn, NY, USA","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2011 Seventh ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20111031,2011,,,167,177,"Aho-Corasick (AC) automaton is widely used for multi-string matching in today's Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.",,978-1-4577-1454-2,978-0-7695-4521-9,10.1109/ANCS.2011.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729,Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table,Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput,automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching,Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead,,1,,27,,,3-4 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly.

Computer viruses infect harmless programs and change the function of that program. One means against these threats is a virus scanner, searching for signatures of known viruses within code and/or data. In this work, we present a novel approach to on-line virus scanning and hash calculation with the help of GPUs (graphics processing units). The main idea is to speed up the search by not searching for signatures on the hard-drive but to scan parts of the main memory and concurrently generate hash values on the code to detect changes. This is appealing and obvious, as the pattern matching has to look at most characters in the text. The first experiments showed that the CPU needs much more time for the execution of shift-like operations and testing for equivalence than the GPU, demonstrating that pattern matching algorithms and hash functions can be efficiently computed on GPUs. As a basis, we use the SHA-1 (160 bit) algorithm. The algorithm uses text properties for the initialization of the hash value and partial sums and/or path properties for the constants in each round. A fundamental part of future research will therefore be the testing if such an initialization can help to detect concatenated extensions like h(m)=h(mx), where m and x are messages of arbitrary length, furthermore, if the independent calculation of hash results in each round will increase or reduce collision resistance.",,978-3-8007-3222-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5758996,,Bandwidth;Clocks;Cryptography;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Pattern matching;Testing,,,,2,,,,,22-23 Feb. 2010,,VDE,VDE Conference Publica

However, both NFA and DFA are not ideal for real-world rule sets: NFA has the minimum storage, but the maximum memory bandwidth; while DFA has the minimum memory bandwidth, but the maximum storage. Specifically, NFA and DFA cannot handle the presence of character sets, wildcards, and repetitions of character sets or wildcards in real-world rule sets. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a dual Finite Automaton (dual FA) to address these shortcomings. The dual FA consists of a linear finite automaton (LFA) and an extended deterministic finite automaton (EDFA). The LFA is simple to implement, and it provides an alternative approach to handle the repetition of character sets and wildcards (which could otherwise cause the state explosion problem in a DFA) without increasing memory bandwidth.

The utilization of cryptography, self-modified code, and integrated attack frameworks provide more possibilities to circumvent most existing perimeter security approaches, such as firewalls and IDS. Even Application Layer Gateways (ALG) which enforce the most restrictive network access can be exploited by using advanced attack techniques. In this paper, we propose a new attack for circumventing ALGs. By using polymorphic and encrypted shellcode, multiple shellcode stages, protocol compliant and encrypted shell tunneling, and reverse channel discovery techniques, we are able to effectively bypass ALGs. The proposed attack consists of four phases with certain requirements and results. We implemented the initial shellcode as well as the different stages and conducted the practical attack using an existing ALG. The possibility to prevent this attack with existing approaches is discussed and further research in the area of perimeter security and log management is motivated.",,978-1-4244-9219-0,978-1-4244-9220-6,10.1109/INM.2011.5990539,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990539,,Chaotic communication;Computer crashes;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Linux;Logic gates;Postal services,channel coding;computer network management;computer network security;cryptography;internetworking,BALG;bypassing application layer gateways;cryptography;encrypted shell tunneling;firewalls;integrated attack frameworks;log management;multistaged encrypted shellcodes;protocol;restrictive network access;reverse channel discovery;security;self-modified code,,0,,24,,,23-27 May 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

However, the use of priority encoder results in increased energy consumption of pattern updates and search operations. This work, proposes a promising memory technology, called Priority-Decision in Memory (PDM), which eliminates the need for priority encoders and removes restrictions on ordering, meaning that patterns can be stored in an arbitrary order without sorting their lengths. Moreover, we present a Sequential Input-State Search (SIS) scheme to disable the mass of redundant search operations in state segments, based on the analysis distribution of hex signatures in a virus database. Experimental results demonstrate that PDM-based technology can improve update energy consumption of nvTCAM search engines by 36%~67% because most of the energy in the latter is used to reorder. By adopting the SIS-based method to avoid unnecessarily search operations in a TCAM array, the search energy reduction is around 64% of nvTCAM search engines.",,,,10.1145/2744769.2744836,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167284,Deep packet inspection;Memory structure;Non-volatile TCAM;Priority-decision in memory;search engine architecture,Arrays;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Registers;Search engines,content-addressable storage;energy consumption;power aware computing;random-access storage;search engines,DPI;SIS scheme;deep packet inspection;energy consumption;energy-efficient nonvolatile TCAM search engine design;hex signature analysis distribution;nvTCAM search engines;pattern updates;priority encoder;priority-decision in memory technology;redundant search operations;regular expression matching;search energy reduction;sequential input-state search scheme;ternary content-addressable memory;virus database,,0,,15,,,8-12 June 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
Scheduling data transmissions of underwater sensor nodes for maximizing value of information,"Boloni, L.; Turgut, D.; Basagni, S.; Petrioli, C.","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA","Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2013 IEEE",20140612,2013,,,438,443,"We consider an underwater wireless sensor network where baseline communication happens over acoustic, multi-hop routes from the underwater nodes to an on-shore station. The data collected by the nodes greatly exceeds the baseline communication capability. At best, the nodes can transmit digests of their full observations. In order for the sink to receive all sensed data, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is sent to each node for collecting data over short-distance, high data rate optical connections. The AUV then offloads all collected information to the terrestrial station via wireless communication when it surfaces. The observations made by the nodes vary in size and urgency. The information they provide has an associated value. Given a path of the AUV, we design scheduling strategies for the nodes to decide when and how much information (i.e., which digest) to transmit via acoustic routes so that the value of information reaching the terrestrial station is maximized. These strategies are compared via simulations on realistic scenarios. Our results show that scheduling algorithms that are able to locally estimate the value of information of a data digest provide the delivery of data with a significantly higher value of information. In contrast, uninformed algorithms, i.e., strategies that do not consider the value of information at the node level, provide only a marginal increase over the benchmark case of using only the AUV for data collection.",,,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831110,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831110,,Acoustics;Data collection;Data models;Modems;Scheduling algorithms;Tin,autonomous underwater vehicles;scheduling;telecommunication network routing;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks,AUV;acoustic multihop routes;autonomous underwater vehicle;baseline communication;benchmark case;data collection;data digest;on-shore station;scheduling strategies;short-distance high data rate optical connections;terrestrial station;underwater nodes;underwater wireless sensor network;wireless communication,,3,,10,,,9-13 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

Hardware Trojans are deliberate and malicious modifications to the logic function implemented within digital and mixed signal chips. In contrast to software Trojans, it is not possible to simply scan the hard drive to eradicate a hardware Trojan. Hardware Trojans can be designed to shutdown the chip at some predetermined time and/or when some specific signal or data pattern is received. They may also be designed to remain hidden while leaking confidential information covertly to the adversary. Determining whether a hardware Trojan has been inserted into a chip is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons, e.g., nanometer feature sizes and chip design complexity combine to make optical inspection difficult or impossible. This paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of a Trojan detection method that is based on the analysis of a chip's Jddqs (steady-state current), which are measured simultaneously from multiple places on the chip. The proposed method also incorporates a technique for virtually eliminating process and test environment variations effects which act to reduce detection sensitivity of traditional testing approaches. Used together, resolution enhancements of up to a 1000 x are possible over conventional single power supply current measurement techniques. A regression-based statistical technique is applied to the data collected from a set of chips fabricated in a 65-nm process to illustrate the detection capabilities and limitations of this type of approach.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2010.2061228,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5530381,"<formula formulatype=inline><tex Notation=TeX>${I}_{rm DDQ}$</tex></formula> testing;Hardware;Trojan;hardware Trojan detection;hardware intrusion detection;hardware security;hardware-oriented security and trust (HOST);leakage current",Chip scale packaging;Current measurement;Hardware;Leak detection;Leakage current;Logic functions;Power grids;Power supplies;Security;Signal design;Testing;Trojan horses;Ultraviolet sources,invasive software;leakage currents;microprocessor chips;regression analysis,hardware trojans;leakage current analysis;logic function;malicious modifications;multiple supply pad I<sub>DDQ</sub>s;regression based statistical technique;software Trojans;steady state current;trojan detection method,,19,,14,,7/29/2010,Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Maga

Head-body partitioned string matching for Deep Packet Inspection with scalable and attack-resilient performance,"Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.; Chenqian Jiang","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing (IPDPS), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on",20100524,2010,,,1,11,"Dictionary-based string matching (DBSM) is a critical component of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), where thousands of malicious patterns are matched against high-bandwidth network traffic. Deterministic finite automata constructed with the Aho-Corasick algorithm (AC-DFA) have been widely used for solving this problem. However, the state transition table (STT) of a large-scale DBSM AC-DFA can span hundreds of megabytes of system memory, whose limited bandwidth and long latency could become the performance bottleneck We propose a novel partitioning algorithm which converts an AC-DFA into a head and a body parts. The head part behaves as a traditional AC-DFA that matches the pattern prefixes up to a predefined length; the body part extends any head match to the full pattern length in parallel body-tree traversals. Taking advantage of the SIMD instructions in modern x86-64 multi-core processors, we design compact and efficient data structures packing multi-path and multi-stride pattern segments in the body-tree. Compared with an optimized AC-DFA solution, our head-body matching (HBM) implementation achieves 1.2x to 3x throughput performance when the input match (attack) ratio varies from 2% to 32%, respectively. Our HBM data structure is over 20x smaller than a fully-populated AC-DFA for both Snort and ClamAV dictionaries.

Variable-Stride Multi-Pattern Matching For Scalable Deep Packet Inspection,"Nan Hua; Haoyu Song; Lakshman, T.V.","Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA","INFOCOM 2009, IEEE",20090602,2009,,,415,423,"Accelerating multi-pattern matching is a critical issue in building high-performance deep packet inspection systems. Achieving high-throughputs while reducing both memory-usage and memory-bandwidth needs is inherently difficult. In this paper, we propose a pattern (string) matching algorithm that achieves high throughput while limiting both memory-usage and memory-bandwidth. We achieve this by moving away from a byte-oriented processing of patterns to a block-oriented scheme. However, different from previous block-oriented approaches, our scheme uses variable-stride blocks. These blocks can be uniquely identified in both the pattern and the input stream, hence avoiding the multiplied memory costs which is intrinsic in previous approaches. We present the algorithm, tradeoffs, optimizations, and implementation details. Performance evaluation is done using the Snort and ClamAV pattern sets. Using our algorithm, the throughput of a single search engine can easily have a many-fold increase at a small storage cost, typically less than three bytes per pattern character.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-3512-8,978-1-4244-3513-5,10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061946,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061946,,Automata;Communications Society;Costs;Educational institutions;Engines;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Pipeline processing;Throughput,content management;pattern matching;search engines,ClamAV;Snort;block-oriented processing;content inspection systems;memory-bandwidth;memory-usage;scalable deep packet inspection;search engine;variable-stride multipattern matching,,17,4,20,,,19-25 April 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
