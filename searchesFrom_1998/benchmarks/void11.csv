Wireless Intrusion Detection System Using a Lightweight Agent,"Haddadi, F.; Sarram, M.A.","Electr. & Comput. Eng. Dept., Yazd Univ., Yazd, Iran","Computer and Network Technology (ICCNT), 2010 Second International Conference on",20100601,2010,,,84,87,"The exponential growth in wireless network faults, vulnerabilities, and attacks make the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) security management a challenging research area. Deficiencies of security methods like cryptography (e.g. WEP) and firewalls, causes the use of more complex security systems, such as Intrusion Detection Systems, to be crucial. In this paper, we present a hybrid wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS). To implement the WIDS, we designed a simple lightweight agent. The proposed agent detect the most destroying and serious attacks; Man-In-The-Middle and Denial-of-Service; with the minimum selected feature set. To evaluate our proposed WIDS and its agent, we collect a complete data-set using open source attack generator softwares. Experimental results show that in comparison with similar systems, in addition of more simplicity, our WIDS provides high performance and precision.",,978-0-7695-4042-9,978-1-4244-6962-8,10.1109/ICCNT.2010.26,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474532,Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless Local Area Network;Wireless network attacks,Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks,computer network security;cryptography;wireless LAN,cryptography;denial-of-service;firewalls;lightweight agent;man-in-the-middle;open source attack generator softwares;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network security management;wireless network faults,,2,,15,,,23-25 April 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Adaptabilty of a GP Based IDS on Wireless Networks,"Makanju, A.; Zincir-Heywood, A.N.; Milios, E.E.","Fac. of Comput.

Third International Conference on",20080523,2008,,,310,318,"Security and Intrusion detection in WiFi networks is currently an active area of research where WiFi specific Data Link layer attacks are an area of focus; particularly recent work has focused on producing machine learning based IDSs for these WiFi specific attacks. These proposed machine learning based IDSs come in addition to the already deployed signatures which are already in use in conventional intrusion detection systems like Snort-Wireless and Kismet. In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too. On the other hand, even though Snort-Wireless is an infrastructure independent detector, it cannot adapt to unknown attacks even if they are similar to others for which it has signatures on.",,978-0-7695-3102-1,,10.1109/ARES.2008.50,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529352,Denial of Service;Genetic Programming;Intrusion Detection System;Wireless Networks,Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;Detectors;Floods;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks,genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;wireless LAN,GP based IDS;Kismet;Snort-Wireless;WiFi networks;data link layer;genetic programming;intrusion detection system;machine learning;wireless networks,,0,,17,,,4-7 March 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
A Comparison Between Signature and GP-Based IDSs for Link Layer Attacks on WiFi Networks,"Makanju, A.; LaRoche, P.; Zincir-Heywood, A.N.","Fac. of Comput. Sci., Dalhousie Univ., Halifax, NS","Computational Intelligence in Security and Defense Applications, 2007. CISDA 2007. IEEE Symposium on",20070604,2007,,,213,219,"Data link layer attacks on WiFi networks are known to be one of the weakest points of WiFi networks. While these attacks are very simple in implementation, their effect on WiFi networks can be devastating. To this end, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed to detect these attacks. In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network. Results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against the different versions of the attack compared to Snort-Wireless and can achieve a detection rate in average 100% and a false positive rate in average 0.1%",,1-4244-0700-1,,10.1109/CISDA.2007.368156,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219103,,Computational intelligence;Data security;Detectors;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks,digital signatures;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless LAN,GP-based IDS;WiFi networks;data link layer attacks;deauthentication attack;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;intrusion detector;snort-wireless,,0,,16,,,1-5 April 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Wireless network attacks are classified on the basis of access control, authentication, availability, confidentiality and integrity as attacks can appear in the form of Access, channel assignment and at the source end. This paper also reflects about the next generation attacks like Man in the Middle Attack, Denial of Service Attack and Eavesdropping.
