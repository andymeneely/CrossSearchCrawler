A framework for large-scale simulation of collaborative intrusion detection systems,"Fisch, D.; Hofmann, A.; Hornik, V.; Dedinski, I.; Sick, B.","Inst. of Comput. Archit., Univ. of Passau, Passau","Soft Computing in Industrial Applications, 2008. SMCia '08. IEEE Conference on",20090529,2008,,,125,130,"Distributed intrusion detection and prevention play an increasingly important role in securing computer networks. In a distributed intrusion detection system, information about the current situation and knowledge about attacks are exchanged, aggregated, fused, and correlated in a cooperative manner to overcome the limitations of conventional centralized intrusion detection systems. However, this distributed approach introduces new challenges such as self-organization and efficient communication techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for developing, simulating, and deploying a distributed intrusion detection system that consists of several collaborating agents. The framework provides a programming interface and comprises all essential communication and synchronization methods that enables self-organized collaboration in a completely distributed manner. In two experiments we demonstrate the performance and capabilities of our implementation by simulating a large-scale worm outbreak and a one-to-many attack. Furthermore, we present two applications of our framework to show how collaboration of agents can be used to detect one-to-many attacks and how detection performance benefits from cooperation of agents.",,978-1-4244-3782-5,978-4-9904-2590-6,10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045947,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045947,,Application software;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer simulation;Data acquisition;Data analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems,security of data;software agents;synchronisation,collaborative intrusion detection systems;computer network security;conventional centralized intrusion detection systems;distributed intrusion detection;large-scale simulation;programming interface;self-organized collaboration;synchronization methods,,1,,33,,,25-27 June 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Cluster Based Co-operative Game Theory Approach for Intrusion Detection in Mobile Ad-Hoc Grid,"Santosh, N.; Saranyan, R.; Senthil, K.P.; Vetriselvi, V.","Coll. of Eng. Guindy, Sch. of Comput.

Security requirements in MANET have to be much efficient due to specific characteristics of ad hoc network. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an integral part of any mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It is very important for IDS to function properly for the efficient functioning of a MANET. In this paper, we try to build an IDS based on a co-operative scheme to detect intrusions in a mobile ad hoc network using basic game theory concepts. To identify the intrusion we deal with two layers - the application layer with underlying grid architecture and the network layer. We simulate a couple of intrusions in each of the two layers and look to resolve them using the coalition formation of the mobile nodes. These nodes obey the shapely value phenomena of the game theory concept and form coalitions to report intrusions in the network.",,978-1-4244-2962-2,978-1-4244-2963-9,10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760460,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760460,,Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Telecommunication traffic,ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile communication;security of data;telecommunication security,MANET;cluster based cooperative game theory;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;mobile ad-hoc grid,,0,,7,,,14-17 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Attack-Tolerant Time-Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Xin Hu; Taejoon Park; Shin, K.G.","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Achieving secure time-synchronization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a challenging, but very important problem that has not yet been addressed effectively. This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-2025-4,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612,,Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks,protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network,,9,,26,,,13-18 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Security in MPSoCs: A NoC Firewall and an Evaluation Framework,"Grammatikakis, M.D.; Papadimitriou, K.; Petrakis, P.; Papagrigoriou, A.; Kornaros, G.; Christoforakis, I.; Tomoutzoglou, O.; Tsamis, G.; Coppola, M.","Technol. Educ. Inst. of Crete, Heraklion, Greece","Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20150724,2015,34,8,1344,1357,"In multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), a CPU can access physical resources, such as on-chip memory or I/O devices. Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.",0278-0070,,,10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504,Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security,Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip,firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip,AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests,,0,,28,,6/23/2015,Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

The modified measurements with the new added ones form a set of measurements that will be used throughout the testing process. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work done for testing IDS in MANET. Simulators are the most common tools used for testing the IDS.
