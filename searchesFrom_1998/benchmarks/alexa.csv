Stealing Webpages Rendered on Your Browser by Exploiting GPU Vulnerabilities,Sangho Lee; Youngsok Kim; Jangwoo Kim; Jong Kim,"Dept. of Comput.

However, their security problems are ignored despite their importance and popularity. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth security analysis on GPUs to detect security vulnerabilities. We observe that contemporary, widely-used GPUs, both NVIDIA's and AMD's, do not initialize newly allocated GPU memory pages which may contain sensitive user data. By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures. The accuracy of our advanced inference attack that uses both pixel sequence matching and RGB histogram matching is up to 95.4%.",1081-6011,,,10.1109/SP.2014.9,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956554,,Browsers;Chromium;Context;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Memory management;Security,graphics processing units;image matching;image texture;rendering (computer graphics),AMD GPU;GPU memory pages;GPU vulnerability;NVIDIA GPU;RGB histogram matching;Web page;graphics processing unit;pixel sequence matching;red-green-blue histogram matching;rendering,,0,,39,,,18-21 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
Controlling malware HTTP communications in dynamic analysis system using search engine,"Aoki, K.; Yagi, T.; Iwamura, M.; Itoh, M.","NTT Inf. Sharing Platform Labs., NTT Corp., Musashino, Japan","Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS), 2011 Third International Workshop on",20111024,2011,,,1,6,"Malware is one of the most serious threats on the Internet. Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.",,978-1-4577-1034-6,,10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563,dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine,Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines,Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols,HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine,,3,,20,,,8-8 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica

The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together.

BrowserGuard: A Behavior-Based Solution to Drive-by-Download Attacks,Fu-Hau Hsu; Chang-Kuo Tso; Yi-Chun Yeh; Wei-Jen Wang; Li-Han Chen,"Nat. Central Univ., Jhongli, Taiwan","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on",20110728,2011,29,7,1461,1468,"Along with an increasing user population of various web applications, browser-based drive-by-download attacks soon become one of the most common security threats to the cyber community. A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164,Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security,Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages,Web sites;security of data,BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site,,4,,36,,,Aug-11,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Maga
