A host-based anomaly detection approach by representing system calls as states of kernel modules,"Murtaza, S.S.; Khreich, W.; Hamou-Lhadj, A.; Couture, M.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means.

Taxonomies based on attacker goals are attack-centric; those based on defender goals are defense-centric. Defenders need a way of determining whether or not their detectors will detect a given attack. It is suggested that a defense-centric taxonomy would suit this role more effectively than an attack-centric taxonomy. This paper presents a new, defense-centric attack taxonomy, based on the way that attacks manifest as anomalies in monitored sensor data. Unique manifestations, drawn from 25 attacks, were used to organize the taxonomy, which was validated through exposure to an intrusion-detection system, confirming attack detect ability. The taxonomy's predictive utility was compared against that of a well-known extant attack-centric taxonomy. The defense-centric taxonomy is shown to be a more effective predictor of a detector's ability to detect specific attacks, hence informing a defender that a given detector is competent against an entire class of attacks.",,0-7695-2052-9,,10.1109/DSN.2004.1311881,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311881,,Computer science;Detectors;Laboratories;Monitoring;Operating systems;Sensor systems;Taxonomy,authorisation;computer crime,Lincoln taxonomy;attack classification;attack detectability;attack manifestations;attack-centric taxonomy;defense-centric taxonomy;intrusion detection;sensor data monitoring,,12,,30,,,28 June-1 July 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition.

In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors.

The experiments were conducted on a new data set, which is more recent and realistic than earlier data sets. The network intrusion detection problem is challenging because it requires one-class learning in an on-line setting with concept drift. The experiments confirm earlier experimental results with LISYS, and they study in detail how LISYS achieves success on the new data set.",1063-6560,,,10.1162/1063656054088503,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789163,Anomaly detection;artificial immune systems;computer security;immune system;machine learning;network intrusion detection,,,,,0,,,,,Jun-05,,MIT Press,MIT Press Journal

However, AID techniques suffer from higher false alarm rate compared to signature-based intrusion detection techniques. In this paper, the concept of intrusion context identification is introduced to address the problem. The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques.",1063-9527,0-7695-2252-1,,10.1109/CSAC.2004.48,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377216,,Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Filters;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Visualization,data visualisation;security of data,anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques;false alarm rate;intrusion context identification;intrusive datasets;system calls trace;visualized anomalies,,1,,18,,,6-10 Dec. 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, why six? accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the why six issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values.

However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods.

It is pointed out that the uncertain short sequences of system calls are closely related to contexts.

Anomaly intrusion detection approaches have the advantage of detecting previously unknown or new attacks, but suffer from the possible high false alarms due to the problem of behavior drifting and the difficulty of building an adaptive model. In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - naive Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as normal or anomalous to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification.

Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans. This paper addresses two key questions about our technique: how many machines are there on the Internet that are hidden behind firewalls, and how common is ingress filtering that prevents our scan by not allowing spoofed IP packets into the network.

Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure.

If the probability of a sequence in a trace is below a certain threshold, the sequence is flagged as a mismatch. If the ratio between the mismatches and all the sequences in a trace exceeds another threshold, the trace is then considered as a possible intrusion.

As an example, the integration between telecommunication and physical processes, that happens when the power grid is managed and controlled, yields to epistemic uncertainty. Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the big-dataism. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources.

In this work, we address an important, yet unexplored problem of masquerading users in a DMS, a threat for which the DMS inherently has no protection. We approach the problem by monitoring the pattern and mannerism of user actions on documents and building a profile of each user using the resulting logs.

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions.

Under this approach, the ID/IP system consists of a core engine with data sensor, detector, configuration device and alert and response device as its main components. The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions.

In this paper, we investigate traffic impacts of cyber attacks considering real-world driver behavior, especially the built-in safety redundancy of the visual verification by drivers or autonomous driving system. More specifically, we study the impact of false-accident attacks on the stability of traffic flow. In the false-accident attack, a vehicle sends out a false accident alert to its surrounding vehicle through CV-enabled network and has considered an attacking scenario that has catastrophic effects. Traffic flow stability is based on widely-used numerical linear stability analysis methods, the ring road test. In such a test, vehicles are restricted within a ring road so that traffic congestion and perturbations appear in cyclic patterns indicating the stability of traffic flow.

Combining Hidden Markov Models for Improved Anomaly Detection,"Khreich, W.; Granger, E.; Sabourin, R.; Miri, A.","Lab. d''Imagerie, de Vision et d''Intell. Artificielle (LIVIA), Ecole de Technol. Super., Montreal, QC, Canada","Communications, 2009. ICC '09. IEEE International Conference on",20090811,2009,,,1,6,"In host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), anomaly detection involves monitoring for significant deviations from normal system behavior. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.",1938-1883,978-1-4244-3435-0,978-1-4244-3435-0,10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832,,Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data,hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data,HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call,,4,,17,,,14-18 June 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
A comparison of techniques for on-line incremental learning of HMM parameters in anomaly detection,"Khreich, W.; Granger, E.; Miri, A.; Sabourin, R.","Lab. d''Imagerie, de Vision et d''Intell. Artificielle (LIVIA), Ecole de Technol. Super., Montreal, QC, Canada","Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications, 2009. CISDA 2009. IEEE Symposium on",20091218,2009,,,1,8,"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in intrusion detection systems. Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.",,978-1-4244-3763-4,978-1-4244-3764-1,10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542,,Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data,hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity,,0,,20,,,8-10 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
