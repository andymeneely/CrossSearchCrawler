Two Stratum Bayesian Network Based Anomaly Detection Model for Intrusion Detection System,Lu Huijuan; Chen Jianguo; Wei Wei,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Technol., China Jiliang Univ., Hangzhou","Electronic Commerce and Security, 2008 International Symposium on",20080822,2008,,,482,487,"An intrusion detection system (IDS) attempts to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (signature-based IDS) or to a model of legal behaviour (anomaly-based IDS). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.",,978-0-7695-3258-5,,10.1109/ISECS.2008.178,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112,Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection,Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic,Bayes methods;security of data,anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network,,1,,22,,,3-5 Aug. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
SSENet-2011: A Network Intrusion Detection System dataset and its comparison with KDD CUP 99 dataset,"Vasudevan, A.R.; Harshini, E.; Selvakumar, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Nat. Inst. of Technol. Tiruchirappalli, Tiruchirappalli, India","Internet (AH-ICI), 2011 Second Asian Himalayas International Conference on",20111229,2011,,,1,5,"In recent years the attack vectors in the network world have increased many fold with the increased usage of Internet and with the exponential growth of various applications. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset. From the experiments it is evident that a closed and secluded network such as SSENet and Tstat tool help researchers in developing and analyzing a new dataset which reflects the changing scenario of network activities.",2157-0647,978-1-4577-1087-2,,10.1109/AHICI.2011.6113948,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113948,Feature Construction;NIDS;SSENet-2011;Tstat,Business;Complexity theory;Fires;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Silicon;Vectors,Internet;security of data,Internet;KDD CUP 99 dataset;NIDS;SSENet-2011;data mining;evolutionary algorithms;machine learning;network intrusion detection system;security experts,,2,,7,,,4-6 Nov. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Developing a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System Using Data Mining for Power Systems,"Shengyi Pan; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.","Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS, USA","Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on",20151019,2015,6,6,3104,3113,"Synchrophasor systems provide an immense volume of data for wide area monitoring and control of power systems to meet the increasing demand of reliable energy. The construction of traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that use manually created rules based upon expert knowledge is knowledge-intensive and is not suitable in the context of this big data problem. This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs. As a proof of concept, an IDS prototype was implemented and validated. The IDS prototype accurately classifies disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks for the distance protection scheme for a two-line three-bus power transmission system.",1949-3053,,,10.1109/TSG.2015.2409775,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063234,Cyber-attacks;data mining;distance protection;intrusion detection system (IDS);power system;synchrophasor system,Data mining;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Power transmission lines;Transmission line measurements,data mining;expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);phasor measurement;power engineering computing;security of data,Big Data problem;IDS prototype;common path mining;cyber-attacks;data mining technique;data volume;distance protection scheme;disturbance classification;expert knowledge;hybrid IDS;hybrid intrusion detection system;knowledge-intensive rules;normal control operations;pattern learning;power system audit logs;power system control;power system scenarios;power systems;synchrophasor measurement data fusion;synchrophasor systems;system disturbances;temporal state-based specification learning;two-line three-bus power transmission system;wide area monitoring,,1,,,,3/18/2015,Nov. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

A resource efficient content inspection system for next generation Smart NICs,"Sabhanatarajan, K.; Gordon-Ross, A.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL","Computer Design, 2008. ICCD 2008. IEEE International Conference on",20090119,2008,,,156,163,"The aggregate power consumption of the Internet is increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the rapid increase in the number of connected edge devices such as desktop PCs. Despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of PCs have their power management features disabled. Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. We use a novel partitioned TCAM technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for SNIC-based deployment.",1063-6404,978-1-4244-2657-7,978-1-4244-2658-4,10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751855,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751855,,Aggregates;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Inspection;Internet;Network interfaces;Personal communication networks;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;content-addressable storage;network interfaces;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet edge device;NIC-based packet content inspection system;green computing;low-power sleep state;network interface card;network intrusion detection;network traffic;next generation smart NIC;power management feature;power proxying;resource-constrained processing;ternary content addressable memory,,2,,25,,,12-15 Oct. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In this paper we introduce a tool, termed bufSTAT that achieves a low probability of false alarm and issues early attack warnings. BufSTAT relies on Finite State Machines (FSM) for attack modeling and can detect every stage of an ongoing attack and can thus prevent its execution by issuing early warning in a progressive manner. It can also detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks that are executed over long periods of time. A significant attribute of our approach is that it is amenable to detecting unknown attacks as well after appropriate modification of bufSTAT.",,0-7695-2369-2,,10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.38,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607577,,Automata;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Delay;Educational institutions;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Time factors,,,,0,,5,,,05-09 Sept. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
