Effective event description using trend template language and efficient intrusion detection,"Habib, M.A.; Phan Minh Dung","Asian Inst. of Technol. (AIT), Pathumthani","Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 2007. ISIC. IEEE International Conference on",20080102,2007,,,326,331,"Trend template language, TTL, is considerably a new approach for describing computer intrusion events. Its inherent strength of linguistic constructs could help describe events more effectively which can help detection process overcome limitations of current intrusion detection techniques to detect attack trends. Some researches have been already conducted establishing the strength and possibilities of TTL as an event description language over some traditional approaches. This article goes further with TTL and dissects the possibilities and limitations of TTL and trend detection with practical view point.",,978-1-4244-0990-7,978-1-4244-0991-4,10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413743,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413743,Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Network based IDS (NIDS);Snort;Trend Detector;Trend Template Language (TTL);Trend Templates (TT),Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Event detection;History;Humans;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection;Statistics,computational linguistics;formal languages;security of data,computer intrusion event description;intrusion detection technique;linguistic constructs;trend template language,,1,,13,,,7-10 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
An Artificial Immune System Based on Holland's Classifier as Network Intrusion Detection,"Randrianasolo, A.S.; Pyeatt, L.D.","Sch. of Comput. &amp; Inf., Lipscomb Univ., Nashville, TN, USA","Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2012 11th International Conference on",20130110,2012,1,,504,507,"In this paper, an Artificial Immune System based on Hollandas Classifier is proposed as a new method for network intrusion detection. This paper is not aimed to provide a comparative study but to give more understanding on the feasibility of combining Artificial Immune System and Hollandas Classifier to detect network intrusion. This new Artificial Immune System, named AIS-CS, can attain higher than 90% intrusion detection with a false negative percentage below 10% and a fairly low false positive rate on a network composed of 50 regular nodes and 50 intruders. The experiments appear to suggest that the best performance can be found by setting the tolerization and the simulation parameters differently. Since there are numerous parameters involved, more experiments need to be performed to further measure this Holland classifier based Artificial Immune System.",,978-1-4673-4651-1,,10.1109/ICMLA.2012.92,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406663,Artificial Immune System;Holland's Classifier;Intrusion Detection System,Biological information theory;Computers;Detectors;Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;USA Councils,artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern classification,AIS-CS;Holland classifier;artificial immune system;false negative;false positive rate;intruders;network intrusion detection;regular nodes;simulation parameters,,1,,13,,,12-15 Dec. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Testing Intrusion Detection Systems in MANET: A Comprehensive Study,"Otrok, H.; Paquet, J.; Debbabi, M.; Bhattacharya, P.","Comput. Security Lab., Concordia Inst. for Inf. Syst.. Eng., Montreal, QC","Communication Networks and Services Research, 2007. CNSR '07. Fifth Annual Conference on",20070529,2007,,,364,371,"In this paper, we study the problem of testing intrusion detection systems (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Testing is achieved by simulating different measurements. We modify the testing measurements of infrastructure-based networks to be compatible with the characteristics of MANET. Moreover, we add some new features and their associated measurements that we believe important for testing new proposed IDS. The modified measurements with the new added ones form a set of measurements that will be used throughout the testing process. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work done for testing IDS in MANET. Simulators are the most common tools used for testing the IDS. Therefore, we add some precautions for choosing a simulator and a list of available simulators. The precautions will help researchers to test the measurements efficiently and the list of simulators will guide them to select one according to their needs. Finally, we present some input parameter precautions that help on having more trustworthy testing results.",,0-7695-2835-X,,10.1109/CNSR.2007.62,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215537,,Ad hoc networks;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Personal digital assistants;Software testing;System testing;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security,MANET;infrastructure-based networks;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks,,0,,17,,,14-17 May 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
