We introduce new data structures (such as a new link structure for slow scan) and new event mechanisms in our system, and present a new method to solve some weaknesses in known techniques, so our system can provide an early scan warning and detect some new attacks.

Exploiting independent state for network intrusion detection,"Sommer, R.; Paxson, V.","TU Munchen, Garching","Computer Security Applications Conference, 21st Annual",20060103,2005,,,13 pp.,71,"Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) critically rely on processing a great deal of state. Often much of this state resides solely in the volatile processor memory accessible to a single user-level process on a single machine. In this work, we highlight the power of independent state, i.e., internal fine-grained state that can be propagated from one instance of a NIDS to others running either concurrently or subsequently. Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging. We have experimented with each of these applications in several large environments and are now working to integrate them into the sites' operational monitoring.

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.",,978-0-7695-3347-6,,10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314,Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis,Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes,Internet;information retrieval;security of data,Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet,,3,,33,,,21-22 April 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

From a security perspective, firewalls and SSL offer little protection. Web traffic often contains attacks such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection that enter through port 80 and are not blocked by the firewall. Among the Web applications HTTP holds the majority share of the traffic transported through Web. In this paper, implementation of an application level IDS has been presented which uses combination of pattern matching and protocol analysis approaches. The first method of detection relies on a multi pattern matching within the protocol fields, the second one provides an efficient decision tree adaptive to the application traffic characteristics to limit the number of patterns to be checked.

Intrusion detection systems attempt to detect things that are wrong in a computer network or system. The main problems of these systems, however, are the many false alarms they produce, their lack of resistance to both malicious attacks and accidental failures, and the constant appearance of new attacks and vulnerabilities. IBM Zurich Research Laboratory has developed a system that specifically targets worms rather than trying to prevent all breaches of computer security. Called Billy Goat, the specialized worm detection system runs on a dedicated machine connected to the network and detects worm-infected machines anywhere in it. Billy Goat has been proven effective at detecting worm-infected machines in a network. It is currently used in several large corporate intranets, and it is normally able to detect infected machines within seconds of their becoming infected. Furthermore, not only is it able to detect the presence of a worm in the network, it can even provide the addresses of the infected machines.

These can be the manifest of misconfiguration issues or highlight attacks particular to some given environments. Both cases are important for administrators in charge of the networks hosting the sensors. We propose in this paper a comparison of simple parameters that reveal to be an easy way to determine these abnormal and particular activities.

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.",1930-529X,1-4244-0356-1,1-4244-0357-X,10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932,,Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic,Internet;invasive software,Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system,,0,,11,,,Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Based on information entropy, risk coefficient was defined to describe the whole condition of network security. To forecast the change of risk coefficient, a model was set up according to grey theory. Using a few data, the model can forecast risk coefficient accurately. Simulation and experiments were completed by MATLAB and in LAN. The experiments in LAN prove that information entropy can reflect anomaly traffic caused by DDoS attacks and Internet worms in time and effectively.

This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components.

The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language.

Thwarting Zero-Day Polymorphic Worms With Network-Level Length-Based Signature Generation,Lanjia Wang; Zhichun Li; Yan Chen; Zhi Fu; Xing Li,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on",20100217,2010,18,1,53,66,"It is crucial to detect zero-day polymorphic worms and to generate signatures at network gateways or honeynets so that we can prevent worms from propagating at their early phase. However, most existing network-based signatures are specific to exploit and can be easily evaded. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325,length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability,Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic,digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic,attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms,,4,2,47,,8/11/2009,Feb. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

On the design of a cost effective network security switch architecture,Nen-Fu Huang; Chih-Hao Chen; Rong-Tai Liu; Chia-Nan Kao; Chih-Chiang Wu,"Broadweb Corp., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Global Telecommunications Conference, 2005. GLOBECOM '05. IEEE",20060123,2005,2,,5 pp.,,"This paper proposes a cost effective architecture for network security switch to deep inspect the traffic among switching ports. A security service engine (SSE) with packet deep inspection ability is also designed to accompany with manageable L2 switches. By properly configuring the VLAN parameters, packets from switch ports of the L2 switch are forwarded to the SSE, via the gigabit Ethernet interface, for deeply inspection. For security reason, abnormal/malicious packets are dropped by the SSE directly while normal packets are forwarded back to the switch to the correct output port. To evaluate the performance and latency of the proposed architecture, a cost effective P4-based SSE is also implemented as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS) with layer-7 content inspection function. The obtained measurements show that the proposed architecture is practical with high throughput and low latency. With IPC-based SSE implementation, the traditional L2 switches can now provide content security service in a very cost effective way.",,0-7803-9414-3,,10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577789,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577789,,Cost function;Delay;Engines;Ethernet networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Security;Switches;Telecommunication traffic,local area networks;packet switching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,gigabit Ethernet interface;intrusion detection and prevention system;network security switch architecture;packet deep inspection;security service engine,,1,,10,,,28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

An investigation of a compromised host on a honeynet being used to increase the security of a large enterprise network,"Jackson, T.R.; Levine, J.F.; Grizzard, J.B.; Owen, Henry L.","Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","Information Assurance Workshop, 2004. Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC",20050606,2004,,,9,14,"The growth of network intrusions on large enterprise networks continues to increase, creating an epidemic of compromised hosts. The deployment of firewalls and intrusion detection systems has not slowed the growth of intrusions to an acceptable rate. Investigating the compromise of a production machine is both difficult and time-consuming due to the mixing of attack and production traffic, while similar investigations of compromised machines on honeynets are much less complex since there is no real production traffic. We discuss why these investigations are easier on a honeynet and how honeynets may be used to make investigations of compromised production machines faster and recovery easier.
