Real-time and forensic network data analysis using animated and coordinated visualization,"Krasser, Sven; Conti, G.; Grizzard, J.; Gribschaw, J.; Owen, H.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., eorgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","Information Assurance Workshop, 2005. IAW '05. Proceedings from the Sixth Annual IEEE SMC",20050815,2005,,,42,49,"Rapidly detecting and classifying malicious activity contained within network traffic is a challenging problem exacerbated by large datasets and functionally limited manual analysis tools. Even on a small network, manual analysis of network traffic is inefficient and extremely time consuming. Current machine processing techniques, while fast, suffer from an unacceptable percentage of false positives and false negatives. To complement both manual and automated analysis of network traffic, we applied information visualization techniques to appropriately and effectively bring the human into the analytic loop. This paper describes the implementation and lessons learned from the creation of a novel network traffic visualization system capable of both realtime and forensic data analysis. Combining the strength of link analysis using parallel coordinate plots with the time-sequence animation of scatter plots, we examine a 2D and 3D coordinated display that provides insight into both legitimate and malicious network activity. Our results indicate that analysts can rapidly examine network traffic and detect anomalies far more quickly than with manual tools.",,0-7803-9290-6,,10.1109/IAW.2005.1495932,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495932,,Animation;Data analysis;Data visualization;Forensics;Humans;Information analysis;Manuals;Scattering;Telecommunication traffic;Three dimensional displays,computer animation;computer networks;data analysis;data visualisation;pattern recognition;real-time systems;security of data;telecommunication security,2D coordinated display;3D coordinated display;analytic loop;animated visualization;anomaly detection;coordinated visualization;forensic network data analysis;honeynet visualization;honeypot visualization;information visualization;link analysis;malicious activity classification;malicious activity detection;network activity;network traffic visualization system;parallel coordinate plots;real-time network data analysis;scatter plots;security visualization;time-sequence animation,,11,4,24,,,15-17 June 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
Identifying Scanning Activities in Honeynet Data Using Data Mining,"Sqalli, M.H.; Arshad, S.; Khalaf, M.; Salah, K.","Coll. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., King Fahd Univ. of Pet. & Miner., Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks (CICSyN), 2011 Third International Conference on",20110829,2011,,,178,183,"Businesses attract different types of attacks mostly due to the financial benefits associated with gaining unauthorized access. As a first step to launching attacks, attackers scan production networks looking for open services and vulnerable software. These scanning or enumeration activities, if monitored properly, can be used as early warning systems against a much sophisticated and dedicated attack. Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots. Being able to identify scanning activities will allow security analysts to focus more on other types of traffic, and hence be able to study and analyze other types of attacks.",,978-1-4577-0975-3,978-0-7695-4482-3,10.1109/CICSyN.2011.47,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005682,Data Mining;Honeynet;Intrusion Detection;Scanning,Data mining;Feature extraction;IP networks;Machine learning;Probes;Servers;Time series analysis,alarm systems;computerised monitoring;data mining;security of data,Honey pots;Honeynet data;aggregate traffic data;business;data mining;early warning system;enumeration activity;financial benefits;hacker origin;malicious activity tracking;open services;production network scanning activity;security analysts;unauthorized access;vulnerable software,,0,,23,,,26-28 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
