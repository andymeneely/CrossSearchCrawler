A Semantic Approach to Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems Using Contiguousand Discontiguous System Call Patterns,"Creech, G.; Jiankun Hu","Cyber Security Res. Group, Univ. of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Computers, IEEE Transactions on",20140318,2014,63,4,807,819,"Host-based anomaly intrusion detection system design is very challenging due to the notoriously high false alarm rate. This paper introduces a new host-based anomaly intrusion detection methodology using discontiguous system call patterns, in an attempt to increase detection rates whilst reducing false alarm rates. The key concept is to apply a semantic structure to kernel level system calls in order to reflect intrinsic activities hidden in high-level programming languages, which can help understand program anomaly behaviour. Excellent results were demonstrated using a variety of decision engines, evaluating the KDD98 and UNM data sets, and a new, modern data set. The ADFA Linux data set was created as part of this research using a modern operating system and contemporary hacking methods, and is now publicly available. Furthermore, the new semantic method possesses an inherent resilience to mimicry attacks, and demonstrated a high level of portability between different operating system versions.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2013.13,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6419701,ADFA-LD;Intrusion detection;anomaly detection;computer security;host-based IDS;system calls,Clocks;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Cryptography;Gaussian processes;Logic gates;Registers,high level languages;operating systems (computers);security of data,KDD98 data sets;UNM data sets;contemporary hacking methods;contiguous system call patterns;discontiguous system call patterns;false alarm rates;high-level programming languages;host-based anomaly intrusion detection system design;modern operating system;program anomaly behaviour;semantic structure,,8,,67,,1/24/2013,Apr-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Maga
A new system to evaluate GA-based clustering algorithms in Intrusion Detection alert management system,"Bahrbegi, H.; navin, A.H.; Ahrabi, A.A.A.; Mirnia, M.K.; Mollanejad, A.","I.A.U. of Shabestar, Tabriz, Iran","Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC), 2010 Second World Congress on",20110217,2010,,,115,120,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) allow to protect systems used by organizations against threats that emerges network connectivity by increasing. The main drawbacks of IDS are the number of alerts generated and failing. Thus in this paper an alert clustering and classification system are proposed. It is able to classify IDS alerts and reduces false positive alerts using clustering of genetic algorithms. To improve the accuracy of the proposed system alert filtering algorithm are used. To achieve the best accuracy in false positive alert reduction and true positive alert clustering and classification, several genetic algorithms are compared. In addition to the known clustering algorithms, two new clustering algorithms are introduced based on Genetic Algorithm and compared with others. By the experimental results on DARPA KDD cup 98 the system is able to cluster and classify alerts and causes reducing false positive alerts considerably.",,978-1-4244-7377-9,,10.1109/NABIC.2010.5716289,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5716289,Genetic Algorithm;IDS;alert classification;alert clustering;false positive alert reduction,Clustering algorithms,genetic algorithms;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,DARPA KDD cup 98;GA-based clustering algorithms;IDS;false positive alert reduction;genetic algorithms;intrusion detection alert management system;system alert filtering algorithm;true positive alert classification;true positive alert clustering,,2,,38,,,15-17 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
Generation of a new IDS test dataset: Time to retire the KDD collection,"Creech, G.; Jiankun Hu","Univ. of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), 2013 IEEE",20130715,2013,,,4487,4492,"Intrusion detection systems are generally tested using datasets compiled at the end of last century, justified by the need for publicly available test data and the lack of any other alternative datasets. Prominent amongst this legacy group is the KDD project. Whilst a seminal contribution at the time of compilation, these datasets no longer represent relevant architecture or contemporary attack protocols, and are beset by data corruptions and inconsistencies. Hence, testing of new IDS approaches against these datasets does not provide an effective performance metric, and contributes to erroneous efficacy claims. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset which is representative of modern attack structure and methodology. The new dataset is contrasted with the legacy datasets, and the performance difference of commonly used intrusion detection algorithms is highlighted.",1525-3511,978-1-4673-5938-2,978-1-4673-5937-5,10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555301,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6555301,,Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Linux;Operating systems;Payloads,data mining;security of data,IDS test dataset;KDD collection;contemporary attack protocols;data corruptions;erroneous efficacy claims;intrusion detection systems;legacy datasets;legacy group;modern attack structure;performance metric,,4,,43,,,7-10 April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
Intrusion detection based on cross-correlation of system call sequences,Xiaoqiang Zhang; Zhongliang Zhu; Pingzhi Fan,"Inst. of Mobile Commun., Southwest Jiaotong Univ., Chengdu","Tools with Artificial Intelligence, 2005. ICTAI 05. 17th IEEE International Conference on",20051227,2005,,,7 pp.,283,"A new light-weight approach, based on the cross-correlation of system call sequences, is presented to identify normal or intrusive program behavior. The program behavior is represented by the cross-correlation value which can be used to indicate the similarity between two sequences. If two sequences are same, the cross-correlation between them will achieve the maximum value. This method of characterizing program behavior by using cross-correlation offers significant computational advantages over HMM (hidden Markov model) or NN (neural network) methods due to the absence of unnecessary training process. Our experiments using UNM (University of New Mexico) audit data show that the cross-correlation based method can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate",1082-3409,0-7695-2488-5,,10.1109/ICTAI.2005.78,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1562950,cross-correlation;intrusion detection;short sequences;system calls,Computer networks;Hidden Markov models;Industrial training;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;National security;Neural networks;Protection;Telecommunication traffic,invasive software;program diagnostics,cross-correlation;intrusion detection;intrusive program behavior;normal program behavior;system call sequences,,0,,12,,,16-16 Nov. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publica
